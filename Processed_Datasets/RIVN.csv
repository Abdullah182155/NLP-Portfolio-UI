At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.
And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Derek Mulvey, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ, who will begin with the opening remarks. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon for our first earnings call. As Derek mentioned, just before this call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of the progress we've made over the recent months. And I encourage you all to read it for additional details around some of the items we will cover on today’s call.
Before I dive into some of our recent milestones, I wanted to provide a quick overview of our business and mission for those who are new to Rivian. Our generation will have profound impact on the planet in the world, our kids’ kids, kids will inherit. We can spend a lot of time on the specifics for climate change, but the reality is, we, as society are rapidly changing the composition of our atmosphere. If we want life as we know it to thrive, for many generations from now, we must change. This is what inspired me to start Rivian, and it's what drives the decisions we make as an organization, including the decision to become a public company.
The challenge of shifting off fossil fuels is as big as it comes. And it's going to require people, companies and entire industries to come together in ways we never have before. From day one, our focus has always been to maximize impact, to keep the world adventurous forever. The word forever is a humbling word. It's very easy for us to think about the world in the context of our lives. But when you think about the world in the context of the many generations to come, it requires we not simply inspire people to buy our vehicles, we must inspire shift in behavior in a new relationship with the world around us.
The transportation industry is at the very start of a transformation, bigger in scale than the shift from the horse to the automobile. The business model, value chain, customer model and technology will be completely remapped as we redefine how we move people and goods on our planet. Rivian exist to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation. Our business encompasses both the consumer and commercial markets.
In the consumer space, we launched our R1 platform with our first vehicles the R1T and R1S, our handshake with the world and our first step in building relationship with our customers. Engineered for all of life’s adventures, our vehicles uniquely combine performance, utility, and efficiency. As of yesterday, we had 71,000 pre orders for our R1 vehicles.
In the commercial market, we are bringing to market the Rivian Commercial Van platform. Our first vehicle on this platform will be our 700 cubic foot electric delivery van or EDV 700. We designed these vehicles working closely with Amazon, who has placed an initial order of 100,000 EDVs. Our commercial vehicles are designed with a focus on safety, comfort and ease of operation. They offer a step change in driver experience, while also delivering a lower total cost of ownership. Every commercial vehicle sold to Amazon is complemented by FleetOS, our proprietary end-to-end centralized fleet management platform with a recurring monthly subscription fee.
The 700 cubic foot EDV has achieved a range of 201 miles based on internal testing, using official EPA test procedures. We have successfully received our certifications to sell these vehicles, and we plan to deliver our first sellable vehicles to Amazon this month. Both our consumer and commercial products are supported by a full suite of value-added services that address the entire vehicle lifecycle, and deepen our customer relationships.
Starting with a clean sheet, we built a vertically integrated ecosystem comprised of our vehicle technology platform, cloud architecture, product development and operational capabilities, products and services. Our ecosystem is designed to deliver rapid development cycles, structural cost advantages, and exceptional customer experiences. After a 12-year journey of getting our strategy and offerings ready for customer deliveries, it has been incredibly rewarding to see the excitement and enthusiasm for what we're building. Over the past few weeks, we've received many recognitions and acknowledgments from editorial and news outlets, including Newsweek, Forbes, Electrek, and Edmunds.
To add to this list, earlier this week, the R1T was selected as MotorTrend’s 2022 Truck of the Year after an exhaustive testing program. This award recognizes the truck that pushes boundaries across all aspects including safety, efficiency, value, advancement and design, engineering excellence and performance.
We are honored by this recognition and the opportunity to illustrate how a clean sheet technology-focused vehicle could eliminate long accepted compromise. After years of meticulous attention to detail, it was rewarding to hear MotorTrend’s state that this may have been the most significant recognition that they have given since the start of the award in 1949. Additionally, earlier this year, we completed a world first -- a historic all-electric crossing of the U.S. in an R1T on the Trans-America Trail.
From a production perspective, I wanted to highlight a significant milestone for our team, the production and delivery of our first vehicles. As the first sale of our R1T drove off the production line number and was joined by my family and thousands of colleagues to celebrate this exciting and emotional moment for our organization. And earlier this week, Claire and I purchased the first two saleable R1S vehicles. We’re at a steep part of our climb, but I couldn't be more grateful be alongside such a dedicated and passionate team for their energy and soul into bringing these vehicles to life.
I'll stop on this point for a second and speak to our manufacturing progress. Launching and ramping production of three different vehicles within a few months is an incredibly tough challenge. This production ramp requires the simultaneous ramp of our supply chain, hiring and training of our production workforce, equipment bring-up and rapid iteration through production quality loops. These challenges have been exacerbated given the state of our global supply chain, tight labor market and of course the complications from COVID.
As of yesterday, we have produced 652 R1 vehicles and delivered 386 of these, including a production sale of our first two recently certified R1S vehicles earlier this week. With 13 working days left at our normal facility, our dedicated teams are working as hard as possible to get as many customers or vehicles by year-end. For 2021, we expect to produce a few hundred vehicles short of our initial 1,200 vehicle production target.
Following the start up production for the R1T, we made the decision to begin introducing the R1S and R1 production line. Ultimately ramping up the R1S in November, while also ramping production of the R1T was more challenging than expected. We produced enough R1Ss to support validation and certification, which are critical for R1S production ramp in early 2022.
Given the importance of R1S, this was a strategic approach that we felt optimized long-term value for the business. We are encouraged by the progress and learnings our team continues to incorporate into our operations. And we have achieved our primary objective of certifying the R1T R1S and EDV 700 for sale this year.
In early 2022, we plan to complete certification of the EDV 500, which is both narrower and shorter than the 700. Our production ramp of the R1T, R1S, EDV 700 and EDV 500 will continue into next year. And we remain confident in our long-term manufacturing trajectory.
Just as we are scaling our manufacturing facility, hundreds of our suppliers are also scaling their production to match our vehicle ramp rate. Our procurement team has remained nimble and continues to work with our supplier partners across all tiers to mitigate issues stemming from our supply chain, the labor market and the COVID pandemic. Given the uncertainty within the supply chain, we've decided to carry higher inventory levels than previously assumed to help ensure we consistently have parts to build.
The good news is we do not believe any of our supply chain challenges represent long-term systemic issues. While our product development and manufacturing teams have been focused on ramping our normal production facility, our real estate and facilities team have been working diligently to ensure we remain well-positioned to capture and drive the accelerated large scale adoption of sustainable transportation.
We are excited to announce today our partnership with the State of Georgia, which will be the home of our second U.S. manufacturing facility. The site selection was the culmination of a comprehensive process in which the Rivian team evaluated a variety of sites across the country, looking for the right combination of site location and logistics, access to talent, and proximity to suppliers. This project represents the largest economic development deal in Georgia's history. The facility will be east of Atlanta, in Morgan and Walton counties and will employ more than 7,500 employees at peak production.
From a construction perspective, we plan to break ground this coming summer, with the intention of having facility start producing saleable vehicles by 2024. The facility will produce our next generation of Rivian vehicles with an eventual target capacity of 400,000 annual units. I want to thank the entire State of Georgia, we're excited to make Georgia another home for us.
The last major milestone I wanted to highlight was the completion of our initial public offering in November, in which we raised $13.7 billion of gross proceeds. We are extremely appreciative of the excitement and receptivity that our existing and new shareholders have shown. These funds enable us to execute on our near-term objectives, including the growth of our manufacturing capabilities for their investment into our vertically integrated technologies, and continued infrastructure and capabilities to support customer experience and engagement.
As part of our IPO, we established Forever by Rivian to extend our impact beyond the proximity and the associated competition they hopefully inspire. Forever’s mission is dedicated to addressing our planet's climate crisis, and preserving the critical biodiversity needed for our planet's long-term survival.
With this, we donate 1% of Rivian’s pre IPO outstanding equity to Forever, making the natural world a stakeholder in our success. Forever will be focused on land conservation, sustainable consumption initiatives, preserving biodiversity, and research and educational stewardship. The value of Forever’s equity is nearly $1 billion today. And I'm excited by the impact this donation can have in preserving the planet for future generations.
Now, I'll hand it over to Jiten, who'll touch on the customer engagement side of the business. Thanks, RJ. We continue to observe strong affinity for our brand, as evidenced by the acceleration we have seen in our backlog of preorders. At Rivian, a preorder reflect a refundable $1,000 deposit and a configured vehicle including everything from paint and interior color to our accessories. As of end of our third quarter, we had approximately 48,000 R1 preorders from customers across the United States and Canada. Since then, we have added another 23,000 net preorders, facing our backlog as of yesterday with 71,000.
Before I jump into a few additional customer experience milestones, I wanted to spend a few minutes walking through our go-to-market strategy. The Rivian go-to-market strategy is rooted in three foundational principles, all designed to efficiently solve existing customer pain points. First, we go direct to the customer. By doing that, we are able to ensure the quality of each interaction.
Second, we have digital force, which means we have invested heavily in the robust cloud-based digital backbone that enables and enhances each interaction. We expect this this will provide deep learning, immersive experiences and scalability as we grow. As an example, our intuitive digital purchase process replaces what otherwise requires several hours at a dealership. With a self-based, stress free experience you can manage in minutes from your account.
And third, we maintain end-to-end control of the entire customer journey. This means every interaction is stitched together into one seamless experience through a set of vertically integrated digital and physical capabilities. These three foundational principles allow us to put the customer at the center of each touchpoint.
Over the past few months, years of hard work, concepts and design have been put into action. You will find further details in our shareholder letter, but I will touch on a few. In September we kicked off our First Mile program. This program provides a variety of ways for consumers to experiences in vehicle, including at home demo rides, and event-based experiences and drives. Since launch, we have hosted over 10,000 guests in our vehicles, and have helped drive in a handful of locations including New York, Normal [ph], Seattle, and California.
Additionally, as we started to sell vehicles in September, our delivery team began to ramp up. As one of many interactions we have with our customers, we put a tremendous amount of thought into our delivery experience. Deliveries happen primarily at a customer's homes, so that they can experience a moment comfortably with family, friends and their whole community if they so choose. During this delivery, a dedicated field specialist is there to walk the customer through everything they need to know about the vehicle, and tailor the delivery experience to the consumer and the family.
As we moved into October, we opened our first Rivian Hub in Venice, California. If you're unfamiliar with Rivian spaces, they are places for our customers, friends and the local community to come together, connect and share ideas. Our spaces portfolio will consist of hubs, like a location in Venice, these new spaces which will be temporary in targeted locations, outposts in more adventures location, and lastly, large tracts of protected land that are accessible to customers.
On the service side, we are prioritizing the rollout of our service centers, targeting the highest concentrations of preorder customers. The service centers are complemented by a fleet of mobile service plans, which will perform the vast majority of service staff at our customer's homes, while expanding the service coverage area. Our delivery cadence is synchronized with the service infrastructure to ensure a worry free and highly responsive service support experience. Our 24/7 service support and predictive diagnostic capabilities will further enhance the service model.
Next, let me pass the call along to Claire, who will provide an update on our financials. Thanks, Jiten. I wanted to echo RJ and Jiten’s excitement in talking to you all on our first earnings call as a public company. I'll start with a review of our third quarter results. In September, we delivered our first 11 R1Ts to customers, generating $1 million in revenue. As RJ mentioned, given that we just started production in September, the third quarter volumes on our manufacturing lines are a small fraction of our expected long-term production capacity. In the near-term, we expected this dynamics of high fixed costs associated with operating and running our large scale, highly vertically integrated plants, amortized over a small but growing number of vehicles produced across the R1 and RCV platforms will continue to have a negative drag on gross profit. As a result, in the third quarter, we generated a negative gross profit of $82 million.
Additionally, we recorded a lower cost or net realizable value, LCNRV adjustment to write down the value of certain inventory, in that we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale, after considering future costs necessary to ready the vehicle for sale. This expense negatively impacts the gross profit in the third quarter, and we expect it to also impact upcoming quarters in the near future.
For example, in the fourth quarter, we have continued to build up our inventory balance to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have experienced today. We immediately record the LCNRV adjustments, which adds to the concentration of fixed costs we recognize as part of our cost of goods sold. As a result of these accounting dynamics, the marginal vehicle we produce in Q4 will have a limited impact on our cost of goods sold. And given the inflationary market backdrop, we also continue to evaluate the pricing for our vehicles.
Turning to our operating expenses, research and development expense for the quarter was $441 million as compared to $220 million in the third quarter of 2020. The higher expense was due to increased efforts related to our R1 Consumer Vehicle program, as well as our EDV Commercial Van program. We also experienced increased expenses related to other advanced product development activities that are critical for our future products.
SG&A expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $253 million as compared to $68 million for the third quarter of 2020. The primary drivers of this increase are related to scaling our sales and service operations, commercial office locations, customer facing facilities and corporate functions to support future business growth. During the third quarter, we recognized a $458 million non-operating expense related to the loss in our convertible note.
This was the result of the issuance and subsequent mark-to-market valuation of our 2021 convertible note. This was a non-cash expense. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $469 million driven by our continued strategic investments in infrastructure, and was primarily due to the expansion of our normal factory, as well as investments in corporate facilities, service operations and experience basis.
Now turning to our cash balance, we ended September with $5.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. Since then, we've completed our IPO raising $13.5 billion of net proceeds, and also raised $1.2 billion of net funds through senior secured notes. Adjusting our cash balance for these two fundraising events, we would have ended the third quarter with approximately $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
As RJ highlighted, there's a tremendous opportunity in front of us to help drive the future of the $9 trillion transportation and services market. However, building out our organization and infrastructure to support our growth requires significant investments. The funds we've raised throughout 2021 offer us the opportunity to execute on our near-term objectives. However, we will continue to look for opportunities to pull forward investments to further accelerate our strategy.
As we look a few weeks ahead, we remain focused on ramping our R1 production and deliveries. In addition with the finalization of our EDV certification, we expect to start making deliveries of the EDV 700 to Amazon before the year-end. We plan to provide full year 2022 guidance during our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call.
With that, let me turn the call back to RJ before opening up the line for Q&A. Thanks, Claire. As I mentioned, delivering our first R1T R1S and EDV vehicles is our primary goal for 2021. I appreciate our team for their focus and dedication to make this goal a reality, despite the unprecedented backdrop of COVID and a challenging supply chain environment. With the growing backlog of 71,000 preorders and our 100,000 unit order from Amazon, we are excited to begin to satisfy the tremendous demand for our products and services. Our team has rallied around their shared values, and continue to demonstrate a tireless work ethic as we continue scaling our production volumes.
Thanks again to everyone for being with us today. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. One question, one follow-up, please. On the capacity expansion, I thought the idea was to ramp up normal first, see everything that works and what doesn't work, and then use those learnings to optimize the selection in the architecture of your second plant. So kind of why expand so soon? And how can you still get those learnings in? Thanks, Adam. Yeah, this is a really key element of how we thought about cascading the programs and how we've architected the product development organization to be capable of, of not only running more than one program and launching more than one program at once, but also to have those fast feedback loops between the different programs. So with that the commercial van has actually learned a lot from the R1 platform and the R1 platform launch. And as we look at our next generation of vehicles we will certainly learn from what we're doing now on the R1 platform and what we're doing on the RCV platform and recognizing that those programs fully develop and then launch.
What you see in terms of the second facility, the facility in Georgia, this is really, this is key for us from an expansion point of view, and the timescales associated with bringing that plant online, really require us to start that work as you've heard, early next year. Thanks, RJ. And just as a follow-up, would love any feedback on the early builds that you've been delivering. What's going right where there's issues? And how you're addressing them? And, when your last -- and S1 I think early November, there was a comment that you expected the orders of the time which were 55,400 to have them delivered to consumers. This is the R1 I'm referring to, by the end of fiscal ‘23. I’m just curious if you can reiterate that today based on everything that you're seeing through your lens on the supply chain. Thanks RJ. Sure. I guess, first just to touch on how we're seeing the vehicles in terms of quality and what's being delivered. There's a tremendous amount of excitement. What we're finding is early customers are excited to invite friends and family to take rides. And we think that's part of what's driving the increased rate of preorder accumulation.
And from a quality point of view, this has been a really key element for us where we're focused on making sure what we're delivering, maintains and really delivers on quality in terms of how the vehicles are built, how they're put together. And what's exciting is watching us add additional features. So through software over their updates, we’re able to not only enhance and improve the software capabilities in the vehicle, but to add features and response some of the early feedback that we're getting.
And then with regards to – go ahead I'm sorry, Adam. Yeah. The second part of the question on reiterating the delivery target by end of 2023. Yeah, so we are working as hard as we can to ramp recognizing the rate at which preorders are coming in exceeds the current rate of production we absolutely need to work to sort of have supply, so to speak, catch up with demand. So we do plan to have the existing preorders make those deliveries by 2023. But if you place a preorder today and if you are delivered in that order, it wouldn't be until 2023 for that delivery. Thanks, RJ. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Your question, please. Hi, everybody. Congrats on what you accomplished in the response to the first product. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about production. First of all, obviously, lots coming together. Where are the biggest bottlenecks at this point in the ramp? Where are you focusing operationally? Can you give us some sense of where your daily production rate is now and what you expect to exit the year at? Ramping something like this, it's almost like an orchestra. We have to simultaneously be ramping the supply chain, simultaneously training the workforce, simultaneously working through any equipment issues and equipment bring-up. And then of course, working through quality loops, as we said, or as I said to Adam, just given the importance of making sure what we're delivering to customers is truly achieving the quality levels that we are committed to.
So as we look at that each of those represents its own set of challenges. And really what makes this situation and this timeframe such a unique time to launch is just the supply chain constraints and supply chain challenges. And what makes it challenging in the case of a vehicle is even if you have 99.9% of the components in the vehicle ramping, so the roughly 2,000 parts that come in and go into a vehicle.
If 99.9% of those have ramped at the same rate of the rest of the production, the small number of suppliers or smaller number of components may be ramping a little slower, can create constraints or bottlenecks. And so we've had to respond to that and we've been very focused on making sure we not only are effectively ramping what's in our plant, but also effectively ramping across all of our suppliers.
Now with that said, those challenges have been really a focal point for us over the last two and a half, three months. And as you heard, we don't see any long-term systemic challenges associated with ramping the supply chain. A number of these issues are short-term in nature and they are solvable problems.
As we look inside our facility and the things that we directly control in terms of ramping our equipment and working through those quality loops, one of the areas that's been a constraint for us thus far has been building our battery modules. And, in the case of the vehicles are producing today, each battery pack has nine battery modules in it, each battery module has 8642170 cylindrical cells.
And the process of assembling the modules and those modules into packs, it takes quite a bit of assembly work and it's a highly automated process. And what we've done to ensure this isn't a long-term risk because we actually have three separate lines that have been brought up. So what we call essentially like a development line that's been running for a number of years now. We then have a larger scale line of fully automated line that's producing a vast majority of what we've put into the roads thus far.
And then we have what we call line two with the line zero, line one, line two, which is coming up as we speak. And this last line is significantly higher volume. And we fortunately took the decision early last year to commission this line recognizing we didn't want to have battery models as a long-term constraint. And we see this -- while this has been a constraint to this point, we do not see this as a long-term constraint, given that we've added so much capacity over the last couple of months. Thanks for that. And just also related to production, as your backlog grows, you're going to get to a point where people won't get delivery until 2024, the great problem I have. Claire mentioned that you're looking at opportunities to accelerate your strategy. Are there things that you can do to maybe accelerate the ramp that you'd originally envisioned for the R1 platform just given the response to the product? Or, are you -- I think Claire alluded to inflation and looking at pricing, are you looking at opportunities to adjust pricing just based on what the demand is for the product? With regards to production, we're certainly looking at how we can accelerate the ramp, given the really strong demand that we have for the products. One of the things that we built into the way we've designed not only the plant, but also the organization is we've made sure that as we set things up, we are capable of exercising the discipline to ramp two lines in parallel. So we have our R1 line and we also have our commercial vehicle line. And not only those separate assembly lines, but those are also separate teams that are working on those activities.
And what that allows us to do is to be really intentional around how we deploy resources. And that ability to be very intentional also allows us to look at increases in capacity, that the plant has been for the plant here in normal to grow capacity from 150,000 units between those two lines to 200,000 units. And it's part of the long-term plan for the plant. And we're looking at how we can accelerate that capacity increase, leveraging the discipline teams that we built.
With regards to pricing, and certainly the backdrop of inflation that we're seeing, and a very strong demand for products, not just within our product set, but I'd say broadly within the electrified space has caused us to look at our pricing. And really, I'd say, recognizing the set of product features that we've been able to put together into the vehicles and vehicles are incredibly -- you've had a chance to drive them.
They're incredibly fun to drive, very capable, over 800 horsepower, zero to 60 in three seconds, great onroad, great off road, but also a great everyday vehicle. So in terms of a competitive set, we recognize they are very aggressively priced. So that is something that we've certainly considered and talked about quite a bit as a management team. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the pace of the orders you have been receiving. I think that they'd maybe increased in the lead up to the IPO given the increased attention the product was getting after the first media reviews with R1T et cetera. Also maybe just because of the increased attention the company was getting around the IPO.
So it would be great to get an update what the pace of weekly orders has been looking like if that took another big leg up after the IPO with the company's name in the news, or maybe some of the market events you've done in California or elsewhere. Also be interested if there has been any maybe increased inbound interest in the RCV platform from potential non-Amazon fleet customers. Thank you. Yeah, hi, Ryan. I think you said it right. Over the last few weeks, we've definitely had an increased attention coming through all the coverage in the media. Equally importantly, with the launch of our First Mile program, and getting the vehicles to the customers, having them experience those vehicles, our first deliveries to which started out predominantly to our employees, but then now happening to non-employees, and end customers. They've all resulted in definitely an increase in interest, demand. And what you're seeing in terms of the heat map of our demand is that it's getting more and more intense.
We're seeing demand grow in all the big markets that we were always present. The intensity of demand is growing, both in the major markets and then also in the greater metropolitan areas around those major markets. So we are, I would say, more than anticipated definitely, but the demand still needs to be robust.
On the RCV platform, we have, as you know, we have an exclusivity arrangement with Amazon in the Last Mile space. And, Amazon being the biggest player in the Last Mile delivery space, and having them as an anchor customer was a strategic decision that we made, allows us to learn fast, allows us to scale and how to deploy a large mega fleet.
But outside the Last Mile delivery space, there is a huge market out there. And we are seeing a lot of interest, inbound interest. We are actively engaged with players in this space, looking at different formats or configurations that could serve their specific use cases. So we are actually quite excited about the size of this opportunity outside the Last Mile delivery space.
And what is even more interesting is the FleetOS. This fleet management platform that we are launching with first vehicles that will be delivered with Amazon, and it's going to be present with every vehicle that we sell as a monthly recurring fee. It also applies to other use cases and drove the scalability of this fleet management platform, the flexibility, the modularity of this provides a lot of opportunities to grow the services side of the business on the commercial side. So that's another unlock of value, long-term value that we've launched. Okay. That's very encouraging. Thank you. And then just lastly as a question on, I guess, battery sourcing strategy. How would you describe the relationship with Samsung? At what point does it make sense to have a maybe more custom designed battery pack or maybe to insource or partner with a battery company to vertically integrate manufacturing of the pack? Is there, I don't know, unit volume threshold, or maybe a date in mind by which you would like to bring batteries in house? How are you thinking about that? Ryan, this is a great question. In fact, I think it's probably one of the most important questions in the context of electrification. And really, it stems from the sheer scale of increase that we're going to need to see as an industry to produce all the batteries necessary to electrify in a 90 to 100 million vehicles a year, and eventually in the aggregate around one and a half billion cars on the planet. So as we've thought about this, we've developed a strategy that really has three, what I would call parallel approaches. And truly parallel, meaning these are not mutually exclusive.
And in the first category of first element of that is sourcing an existing cell. And that's what we've done with Samsung SDI for launch vehicles. And it's a cylindrical 2170 cell, high nickel content cell. And we've sourced that from existing capacity, capacity that already existed in the world. That type of deal we see is really being -- we don't see a lot more deals like that happening across the industry.
Essentially, as the demand for cell starts to climb, we need to be building new capacity. And what we see is the second category or second approach, again, happening in parallel, is the need to create capacity or co-investing capacity with cell suppliers. And we're certainly doing that. We haven't announced any of those relationships yet. But for us to continue scaling out to 2023 and beyond that co-investment in capacity is going to be critical for us.
And then really the last parallel path, last arm of the strategy for us, is taking an even more vertically integrated approach where we completely control the design of the cell, and the sourcing of the raw materials that go into the cell. And that third approach is core to our strategy. We've been working on that for quite some time. And in fact, we'll be producing cells in pilot form starting late next year. And that vertical integration of the cell doesn't mean the first two categories don't remain super important.
It just simply is in response to our intended growth. And when one looks at the amount of cells we'll need as a company, all three of those approaches, meaning sourced capacity that was already existing in the world, newly created capacity that we co-invest in with our supplier partners, and newly created capacity that we entirely invest in and control. All three of those pathways are going to be critical for us as we start to look out into the second-half of the 2020s, and scaling as a business. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your question, please. Hey, everybody. A first question on the ramp of the preorders, because they're certainly a bit faster than maybe we were expecting. And we thought you'd have to have a more of these trucks out on the road to really build this momentum. But it's coming fast and furious here. So I'm just curious relative to your expectations, how the preorders are rolling in. And if you have any early read sort of on the demographics, and the vehicles that are certainly not being traded indirectly here, but where the buyers are coming from? Any sort of specifics around these folks because it's a lot and it's pretty quick. Yes, it's certainly exciting. Their response to the vehicle has been outstanding. And what we're seeing a lot of over the last, really over the last couple of months is heightened awareness of the company. Certainly the IPO contributed to that. But a lot of it's also been just the broad coverage that we've seen from a variety of different outlets and media sources. As I mentioned earlier, MotorTrend’s selection of us as their 2022 Truck of the Year and their comments and sort of excitement around the vehicle is emblematic of what we've seen from a number of different publications.
Coupling that with just more awareness of the vehicle, so some of our drive events that we've done and then the early deliveries we're doing, we often joke, every early customer turns into a sales representative for the company, because there is just so much excitement for the vehicle and so much excitement for the product.
With that said, we do expect that to continue. We expect to as awareness continues to go up, that will lead to continued increase in preorder demand. And in some of the earlier questions, it certainly has us focused on how do we make sure we continue to ramp production. And as we talked about, we look for opportunities to pull ahead on our volume ramp. And so RJ, any early read on who these folks? Are they previous buyers that are stepping up into trucks or the truck buyers that are staying in trucks? I mean, what's the early read on sort of the folks that are placing these preorders? Yeah, absolutely. I think this has been one of the -- it sort of has validated the strategy, and the hypothesis that we had in terms of positioning of the R1. We had always intended this vehicle to be in this whitespace. And by definition, the whitespace should be attracting share from a lot of adjacent markets and segments.
And you're absolutely right, what we are finding is a true validation of that hypothesis, where a vast majority of our customers are coming from, one, never having own electric vehicles, two for the R1T we have close to 90% of customers that have never own a truck. And that has been one of the factors where this vehicle is attracting so many shoppers and so much of cross buying activity that is resulting in interest in the product with this.
And I will add this is a lot due to the coverage and the experience that our customers are having with the R1T. We are expecting this to actually only get even bigger, once the R1S hits the market, people are able to experience that up close and close personal are able to drive in it. So we are definitely -- it is more than we anticipated. Absolutely, very encouraging. And, as RJ mentioned, it has also opens up opportunities on what we could do from the quality of earnings, from a pricing point of view. So we are looking at all these options right now. Well, it’s something you'd have a real high class problem on your hands. Just lastly, on the Georgia facility, 7,500 jobs use a multiplier on that you could certainly argue for Georgia, this is going to be 50,000 to 100,000 net incremental jobs all in when you go through the value chain. I'm just curious as you worked out this deal with Georgia, what the terms are? And Claire, I mean, if you were to think about this on gross CapEx versus net CapEx, I mean, how big a benefit is it going to be to have worked with Georgia versus what you would have spent otherwise? Sure. So, relative to our original plan record, as we thought about the overall cost for our second facility, I would say that this is certainly an advantage position to what we originally anticipated in terms of growth CapEx metric that we would put out there in the market. And so, we’ve worked really closely with the State of Georgia across the incentive package here. It's a very attractive one for Rivian and we're really excited about not just the incentive package, but as you mentioned, the true talent pool that exists within that market that we think will be really optimal as we want to scale production and build out a significant second facility in the U.S. market. Could you quantify that at all? I mean, it's a really good thing for Georgia. So, I mean, they should be pitching in. I'm just curious what maybe relative to your base case expectations versus what you're able to work out here, if you can give us an idea of what you got on the capital side, or NPV. I would say, we'll have more to come on that in future announcements. But right now, I would just say that it's certainly a great deal for Rivian and great deal for Georgia as well. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your question, please. Yes, thank you. I just want to drill a little bit more down on the production ramp. If you kind of think through you went to the word constraints, its course brings to mind the classic Theory of Constraints. Could you maybe describe in a little bit more detail, where you think the key constraint is? Now you did mention perhaps the welding of the battery packs. And how do investors get confidence that the constraints can be knocked off versus their worst case, something fundamental about the design of the vehicle, or the battery packs, that would complicate anyway? In ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra. So you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.
So as we go through that process, we have multiple meetings throughout every day, tracking how we're managing all those different constraints. And as the lines each aspect of the plant, whether it's stamping or body shop, or paint shop or battery assembly, or driving assembly, or general assembly of the full vehicle, whether there's any constraints within those and how we continue to progress the hourly and daily output.
And with that said, we're ramping largely as expected. The battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line. And as I said, that doesn't represent any long-term challenges for us. We have a second line that's coming on that will put the battery module production way out in front in terms of capacity of the other areas of the plant.
So as we work through these quality loops, as we work through training our workforce, this is part of the challenge. And I'd say we just need to recognize that the plant is designed to run at significantly higher output. And what we're seeing today in terms of output just represents the front-end of an S curve, which is typical for this type of a ramp up. And just to follow-up, anything in terms of having to go back to the drawing board, and either the configuration of a pack, particular parts or things that would be longer cycle fixes, as opposed to just ironing out the kinks and attacking bottlenecks on a daily basis that come up. No, we don't see any long-term systemic challenges either the supply chain, or with the way that the vehicle has been designed, or the manufacturing plant has been designed. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Yes, good afternoon. And thank you very much for taking the questions. So I'm going to start on the commercial side of the business, the 201 miles of estimated range that you're seeing it's very attractive, I think, would cover a number of routes. And so moving to better understand what it may take to build upon that initial 100,000 order from Amazon. Is it executing on some of the technical milestones as you seem to be doing? Or would be more around having to hit a certain percentage of that order in terms of delivering vehicles before there may be upside to that initial 100,000? Mark, it's a good question. As we think about the commercial space and Jiten spoke to this earlier, Amazon represents such a large pool of demand for us. And as a result, we're very focused on making sure that we deliver to their needs and they're not only the largest player within the Last Mile space, but they're also the most rapidly electrifying. So it's really critical that we do not starve them of vehicles.
Now saying that the vehicle platform, the RCV platform was architected and designed fully contemplating vehicles beyond Last Mile, so that’s in the cargo space, that's in the workspace. So there's a whole host of opportunities that exists both in large volumes, but also across a very long spread out tail of commercial applications. And so for us, the bringing up those non EDV versions of the vehicle is something that we are focused on and the design team and engineering teams are working towards that. But we're balancing that with just managing how much complexity we're introducing, it's the plan, and wanting to do that at the right rate, and at the right time.
As you heard me talk about earlier, over the course of the next quarter, we'll be ramping up not just R1T, R1S and the EDV 700. But we're introducing the EDV 500, which is a narrower and shorter variant of the EDV van. Adding additional variants on top of that will come but we're balancing the desire to minimize complexity, while we're ramping up production. That's helpful. And for my second question is hoping you could comment on the supply environment in terms of semiconductors and other components, it's been tight for a long while now. And a few auto companies have started to see a little bit of easing as we move through the fourth quarter or reopening some previously closed factories. At the same time, unfortunately have the Omicron variant that could perhaps complicate things. So, just hoping if you could give a bit more specific on any changes that the company may be seeing in its supply chain environment. Thank you. Yeah the supply chain environment has been incredibly challenging. It's unprecedented in the number of issues that we've seen as an industry across a variety of different commodities and components. Certainly semiconductors is one of those, and we're very, very focused on that. A week doesn't go by where I'm not speaking to heads of some of our major semiconductor suppliers.
With that said, I'd say the element of this, it's really worked in a positive ways, as we've taken a very transparent approach with our suppliers to both communicate to them our ramp, and to be very clear on expectations. And in return, we also have a clearer picture of what their ability to supply is, and how that translates to our ramp. And we're managing that very thoughtfully. And semiconductor certainly gets the most attention.
But I'd say that's true across the rest of the supply chain. And in a lot of cases, the areas where the constraints have been challenging for us over the last three plus months have been in areas that might not be expected. These are smaller suppliers that have been unable to hire second shift or smaller suppliers that are having issues with COVID. So we're seeing a lot of those types of challenges and bringing up our supply base with several hundred suppliers.
We've got a team that's very hands on with all these different suppliers. We're working with them closely, in many cases working with them in their production facilities. So we have both very good visibility, and we're also working very collaboratively to make sure that they achieve the ramp. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Yeah, thank you very much. My first question is around software and subscription. On what timeline would you expect to start essentially seeing some of these revenues both on the commercial side was Amazon, is that going to be from day one, and then on the consumer side. And then any sort of like initial views on the consumer side in terms of take rates or sort of like average subscription revenue per vehicle? Yeah, hi, Emmanuel. Two parts to that, so on the commercial side, just to confirm the FleetOS sort of goes live at launch. In other words, as we start deliveries to Amazon this month, each vehicle comes with a recurring monthly subscription of FleetOS. And the set of features that are included, we consider them as a V1 of a feature set. And as these makers are deployed and operational, we expect to grow this feature set by creating more value on the TCO level for Amazon. So that software subscription goes live basically now on commercial side.
On the consumer side, the software side or the services side of our business has different flavors. The primary flavor is membership, which every vehicle owner today gets a complimentary membership for a year. And our goal is that at the end of that period, we would actually start charging our customers a monthly fee. And that would represent, again, a basket of features, which will include, but not be limited to charging, roadside and connectivity. There will be other elements into that membership offering that we are working on, and curating and designing it diligently. And you will use this time, this feet, this time where the members get this free membership to build that basket.
Apart from that, there are other flavors of software subscription, which could be on an individual software basis, or other bundles that we will put together. We expect to work on those and announce those in the coming months. But yes, it's early for us as we've just started doing deliveries, which comes with a free membership period. The only other point that I would just add on that from a services perspective is, we have seen strong uptake in regards to our insurance and financing as well for the vehicle, given the really seamless experience. You can go through our transactions and delivery process in a matter of minutes. I've gone through it twice myself in literally less than 10 minutes. And so the ease of use and simplification of that process has really shown through from a take rate perspective, especially on those two leading edge features that are part of that initial transaction as well. Okay. That's great color. And then my second question, coming back to the topic of ramping up production. So RJ, I understand your points around it's not being structural and obviously, to be expected, I guess, with this kind of challenge and environment. But based on what you've seen so far and sort of going through these issues, are you generally confident that your ramp up should be on target to be able to deliver some of the 2022 targets?
There were obviously some reports early a few weeks back around some of the SUV delivery timeline being sort of like pushed out. And so overall, are you confident that this is mostly in the rearview mirror and going forward you're tracking in line with some of your delivery targets? Yeah, we're quite confident in the path ahead. I guess it's worth just commenting a little bit on what the activities have been over the last three months. And, I said it at the start of the call, but it's important to reiterate. We're launching three vehicles this year. So we have the first R1T drive off the line in September. We just sold the first two and delivered the first two R1Ss this week, actually Clair and I as the first two customers. And we'll be making deliveries on EDV 700 very soon here before the end of the year.
And when you look at those three different launches, there's also correspond with three different certifications, all three of those vehicles been certified for sale. And they're being produced on two different production lines. So there's a line that's producing the R1 products, there's a line that's producing the commercial vehicle products. And as we've discussed before and this is such a critical element of what we're building, we wanted to make sure the company and the organization was architected to facilitate running an operating multiple programs at the same time.
One of the challenges that we've seen over the last two months has been bringing up R1S on the R1T line, and recognizing that because it's a shared line we just started production of sellable units on R1T in September. And then within a few weeks, we were putting our R1Ss into the line as well. And that proved to be more challenging than we had anticipated before.
But fortunately we managed through it and we were able to produce enough vehicles to certify and the R1S and put that through the validation process. And it was a decision we took and we took the decision to rapidly integrate the R1S into the line, while we're still ramping R1T, given really our long-term focus and what we see is being critical long-term for our brand and for our customers of having both of those products in the market as quickly as possible.
And so as we now look at what the ramp will look like for both R1T and R1S into next year, having done those activities this past fall, and having certified both the R1T and the R1S as well as the commercial van the EDV, it really positions us to rapidly grow through the course of 2022. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Your question, please. Perfect. Thanks, guys. First question is on in house cell capacity in Georgia, you alluded in the investor letter that you'll have in house cell capacity contemplated to be co-located with that facility in Georgia. I'm interested, is that going to be the case from day one in 2024? Is that something that you're working into the plants to eventually have in Georgia? As we think about the Georgia site, and this is one of the key considerations for us, as we looked at different sites around the country, this is a platform for us to grow from. So, as we introduced the first products there the plant went immediately started 400,000 units of annualized capacity, but we'll grow to that. And much the same way we've sized the site. And in the site selection process, we've made the selection contemplating a significant amount of battery cell production. But that will come in over phases.
And so, when we first launch the site, it will be just vehicles. And then shortly thereafter, we will add our in house cell production, and then in house cell production will grow quite dramatically over the course of the following years. And given the criticality of that from a cost structure and from a scaling point of view, it's something that we've placed a lot of emphasis on in selecting the site. Okay, great. And then the second question just on DC fast chargers. If I recall, you're working on a target of 600 or so DC fast chargers in the network. Just curious to hear if that still is the target, what the timeline is behind that and any opportunities to accelerate, maybe also regions of initial focus? Thanks. Yeah, absolutely. We are on track for the long-term our 2023 target of having 600 sites. We are prioritizing sites, and synchronizing it with locations where we are making deliveries. Along with setting up our service and support infrastructures, so we're trying to doing this in a planned fashion and in stages.
There are multiple sites across the country that are in different stages of commissioning, both from procuring the sites, setting it up. And, we believe having a robust charging infrastructure is going to be critical in the adoption and also from a customer experience point of view. And we are continuing to invest in that area of our business and progressing. Great. Good to hear. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas from Baird. Your question, please. Hey, everyone, thanks for taking my question. Sort of tangential to a previous question asked, but some of your auto OEM colleagues recently secured a critical materials supply chain contracts. And I'm curious as to how you think about the EV material supply chain and how much of a priority you place on making sure you have materials for the next several years as you ramp production? Thank you. Very similar to the comments I made before with regards to overall battery cell production. We have incredibly strong conviction around the importance of playing an integral role in the far upstream supply of battery, the battery raw materials. And we've built our team to really drive that. So that's understanding deeply the mining space, understanding deeply the processing space, and of course, understanding deeply and designing in house cells that then support that or leverage that I should say.
So with that said, we expect and we believe that a lot of the investments necessary to rapidly build up the upstream supply of raw material, and when I say rapidly build up, I mean, increasing the capacity of the upstream supply chain by a factor of 20x to 30x, over the next 10 to 15-years. We believe that the end customers, in this case, the OEMs are self-included will need to take a very active role in that. And while we haven't made any announcements in this space, it's certainly something that we're very focused on. Thanks. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to RJ, for any further remarks. Well, thank you everybody for joining the call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ, who will begin with a few opening remarks. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon for our earnings call. Before we dive in, we wanted to first take a moment to address the crisis in Ukraine. As an organization, we are deeply concerned about Russia's invasion and stand by the people of Ukraine. The humanitarian crisis resulting from the current development is clearly becoming a focus of governments and companies around the world. We are inspired by the actions so many have taken and we'll continue to evaluate ways we at Rivian can show or support. As Tim mentioned, just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of the progress we've made over the recent months. I'd encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. We'll touch on our recent achievements, production progress and product development. Before we do that, I want to personally address last week's pricing announcement. We released an update to our R1 product portfolio that included our new dual motor propulsion system as well as our standard battery pack. The dual motor propulsion system consists of a single motor drive axle where we've integrated the drive unit, the inverter, the gearbox into a really power-dense package. And in the dual motor application, we put one of those in the front and one of those in the rear of the vehicle. And in total, it delivers over 600 horsepower and achieve zero to 60 in less than four seconds. It's really cool. We also use that drive unit in a single motor application as a front-drive unit in our commercial delivery vans. Along with that, our standard battery pack is leveraging LFP and LFP chemistry, and that chemistry not only allows us to offer that pack at a lower cost, but it really fits commercial applications well. And it's first going to be launched in the commercial vehicle platform later this year, and then will make its way into our consumer vehicles by late 2023. Now as we develop these new offerings, we need to make sure that these offerings could fit into our product portfolio. And to do that, we revisited the overall pricing strategy. Prior to the pricing changes, our R1 platform had a price range without options of $67,500 to $83,500 and only included quad-motor variants. With the addition of these new product offerings, the R1 platform's price range is now $67,500 to $95,000, including both quad and dual-motor configurations as well as the standard range LFP battery pack. On March 1, we announced the dual-motor and standard battery pack along with this updated pricing model. In applying the updated pricing to existing pre-order customers, we failed to appreciate that customers view their configuration as price locked, and we wrongly assumed pre-order customers would be open to reconfiguring to the recently announced dual-motor and standard battery pack if they wanted to maintain a similar price point to the original configuration. We recognized this was a mistake and quickly moved to honor the original configured pricing for our pre-March 1 pre-orders. Our relationship with customers is the most important aspect of what we're building, and we believe our early customers are critical for establishing the brand foundation needed to support many millions of sales across our future vehicle portfolio. Since launching in 2018, we believe the brand loyalty we have forged is one of our most viable assets and something we believe will continue to drive network effects moving forward. With this, we remain highly confident in our ability to address the massive market opportunity that sits before us. Electrification is at a tipping point as trillions of miles traveled each year across the planet transition to EVs. This is a massive shift and one that requires multiple companies to be successful in building interesting products that give customers lots of choices. While the near-term industry conditions remain very fluid, our path to creating long-term value is unchanged. We are targeting the most attractive market segments with exceptional products. In the consumer space, we're building a global brand that applies to a wide range of products, sizes and markets in the truck, SUV and crossover segments. In the commercial space, we're targeting with an initial -- we're launching with an initial focus on last mile delivery through our partnership with Amazon, and we'll use this critical scale to support growth across the commercial space. We are in a unique position to establish significant last mile market share through our Amazon partnership and have the opportunity to capitalize on software and services through fleet OS. We are vertically integrating core technologies to ensure our products continue to lead, enable us to move quickly to make enhancements and provide long-term structural cost advantages. The initial feedback from customers and third parties has been really rewarding to see, from customers excited about the most recent OTA, to MotorTrend selecting our R1T as their 2022 Truck of the Year. Our products continue to generate a lot of enthusiasm. All of this excitement continues to provide momentum to the brand. As of March 8, we had approximately 83,000 pre-orders, our pricing model, which encompasses the dual-motor drivetrain and standard pack has demonstrated continued strong demand, with pre-orders following the pricing update remaining at approximately the same rate as prior to the announcement. Demand remains extremely robust. With our 2022 priorities, we've been very focused on ensuring we have the right team working towards our mission. Next week, we'll be announcing our new COO that will be responsible for helping to scale our production and supply chain. We have also continued to hire great leadership across the business to keep up with our rapid scaling. Ultimately, the strength of our team is what determines our ability to execute our vision. Not surprisingly, our highest priority for the remainder of 2022 is ramping production of our normal Illinois manufacturing facility. As of March 8, we produced 1,410 vehicles this quarter and 2,425 vehicles since the start of production late last year. During the last two weeks, we have averaged a weekly production rate that is approximately two times the rate of the fourth quarter of 2021. With that, I'd like to talk a bit about the R1 production ramp. This ramp is progressing well across all areas of the R1 production line, and we're achieving demonstrated production rates that are in line with our expectations. And with all this progress, the biggest constraints we now face really lie with the supply chain. And it's really a small number of parts for which the supplier isn't ramping at the same rate as our production lines are ramping up. I want to talk just about one specific area. Previously, we talked about battery modules, and this was a constraint that we saw at various times through Q4. And as you may remember, we have two module lines, module line 1, module line 2. And module line 1 is now running at twice the speed at what we saw at the end of 2021. And module Line 2 is ramping up very quickly, and in line with our expectations. With line 1 and line 2 now ramping, battery modules are no longer a constraint to the plant. With that, I also want to talk about R1S. And R1S is being ramped very methodically. We learned a lot from what we've been through in the fourth quarter. And as we're methodically ramping this up, we're balancing component supply for the parts that are different on R1S relative to R1T, and we're also managing the fact that, that product is coming up behind the R1T in terms of its level of ramp maturity to ensure that we're optimizing for overall production output for the line. Now with that said, we should also talk about EDV. And the EDV ramp is quite a bit different than what we've been through in R1. It benefits from all the learnings you'd expect from the EDV line really being our second production line. Operationally, the line is ramping as intended without any major surprises or roadblocks. But as we've seen with R1, we are gated by a number of supplier ramp challenges. And given that the EDV production lines are capable of ramping faster than what we saw with R1, these supply constraints feel more pronounced than what we experienced in the initial weeks of ramping R1. With these supply constraints, the EDV is being built or being used to refine the digital integration of our software systems with Amazon to ensure alignment with the standard operating procedures for these vehicles. Feedback from Amazon and the drivers on the software is quickly being ingested, and we're using that to drive the OTAs on the platform. With all this we expect EDV production to ramp considerably during Q2. Now it's worth noting the challenges our suppliers are facing vary and include company-specific production issues, COVID-related delays, and semiconductor allocations. We're working closely with any of these constrained suppliers to identify component challenges early so that we can support the supplier ramp and develop alternative solutions if needed. While the 2022 production ramp is a core focus from an operational point of view, our future technology and product pipeline are also really exciting. As a preview of some of the major initiatives, we're developing a proprietary 800-volt architecture, which includes new in-house drive units that will further enhance performance and efficiency of our announced dual and quad motor configurations. This higher voltage architecture also includes onboard charger, DC/DC converter and DC to AC converter, where the power stages of the DC/AC and the AC/DC are bidirectional and share semiconductors, magnetics and the controller. We're also developing a heat pump-based thermal system, and along with that, a range of new battery packs, including what I talked about before, the LFP chemistry, an LFP chemistry being used within these packs. Now, beyond the in-vehicle power electronics, we also continue to develop our portfolio of charging and energy products to expand really beyond what we've already talked about and shown in our DC chargers to include a bidirectional home charger and home energy products. And the technology work isn't just focused on propulsion platforms or charging or power electronics. We're also developing an improved network architecture and the associated electronics topology to consolidate multiple compute platforms for reduced cost and complexity. We're developing our next generation of perception hardware along with that. And that perception, hardware is being used with a new higher compute platform for the autonomous system. We believe that all these investments and all this technology will really increase the desirability and of course, the capability of our vehicles, while also delivering improved unit economics on the vehicles. Next, let me pass the call on to Claire, who will provide an update on our financials and the business outlook. Thanks, RJ. I want to echo RJ's feeling of encouragement with the progress we're making at the plant, the robust technology roadmap we have in place and the strong backlog of demand from consumers and Amazon. I'll start with a review of our fourth quarter 2021 results. After years of development and design, 2021 was an important year for Rivian as we launched three vehicles across two vehicle platforms and initiated our first customer delivery. During the fourth quarter, we produced 1,003 vehicles and delivered 909 vehicles, which generated $54 million of revenue. As we've discussed in the past, as we ramp our production, the volumes being produced on our manufacturing lines are a small fraction of our current 150,000 units of annual capacity. In the near term, we expect this dynamic of high fixed costs associated with operating and running our large-scale, highly vertically integrated plant, amortized over a small but growing number of vehicles produced across the R1 and RCV platform, will continue to have a negative drag on gross profit. In addition, we experienced higher costs due to inflation and supply chain challenges, which resulted in increased bill of materials and higher logistics costs associated with expediting shipping of certain parts. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we generated a negative gross profit of $383 million. Additionally, we recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value, LCNRV adjustments to write down the value of certain inventory to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale. This expense negatively impacted gross profit in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to also impact upcoming quarters in the near term. Turning to operating expenses. Research and development expense for the quarter was $726 million as compared to $255 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increased spend stem from our current and future vehicle programs as well as cross-platform technologies. As RJ mentioned, we have kicked off our in-house motor system Standard Range LFP battery pack, Rivian Cloud architecture and many other hardware and software technologies that will allow us to introduce more accessible price points, improve gross margins and enable us to expand our high-margin lifetime software and services revenue opportunity. Finally, we realized stock-based compensation expense of $277 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a reminder, our stock-based compensation vesting conditions were deemed probable at IPO, resulting in the recognition of our first stock-based compensation expense in Q4 2021. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $682 million as compared to $98 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. As we scale our production, it's important we also scale our commercial operations, providing a seamless, comprehensive consumer solution is part of what customers expect when purchasing a Rivian vehicle. This requires investments in our digital experience, customer engagement and delivery teams, service operations and customer-facing facilities and events. In addition, we continue to focus on attracting new talent that will help us grow and reach our long-term objectives. We realized $277 million in stock-based compensation associated with SG&A. In Q4 2021, we also recorded other expense of $663 million. This primarily non-cash expense represents the accounting for the 8 million shares of Class A common stock and $20 million of cash that was donated to Forever by Rivian, Inc., in conjunction with our IPO. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $455 million, driven by our continued strategic investments in infrastructure. The capital expenditures were primarily due to expansion of our normal factory as well as investments in corporate facilities, service operations and experience bases. We have created a tremendous ecosystem, bringing together our in-house in-vehicle technology, the Rivian Cloud, and our product development and operations infrastructure that support our launch products and services and build the foundation for growth. We are at the tipping point of the EV transformation. We play in the fastest-growing and most profitable market segments, and we'll continue to scale our offerings with new price points, use cases and form factors. During the fourth quarter, we completed our initial public offering, which provided us capital to help execute our near-term road map. We ended the year with $18.4 billion of cash on hand, which includes restricted cash. As we look forward to 2022, I wanted to reiterate our excitement for the opportunities ahead and continued improvement in the areas of our business that we can control. Our primary focus will be to ramp our normal facility and the production of our R1 and RCV platform. While we work diligently to alleviate any supply chain challenges, we believe that through 2022, the supply chain will be the fundamental limiting factor to our total output for the year. We believe our normal facility, manufacturing equipment and processes have the ability to produce approximately 50,000 vehicles across our R1 and RCV platform in 2022, if we were not constrained by our supply chain. Our confidence comes from weeks of batch building that have proven our processes and equipment are ramping as we had expected and intended. Despite this, due to the supply chain constraints, which are currently visible to us, in 2022, we plan to produce 25,000 vehicles across our R1 and RCV platform. Our estimated adjusted EBITDA for 2022 is negative $4.75 billion, primarily due to continued forward investments. We will increase our research and development expense through investments in future vehicle platform, vertical integration of shared technologies as well as our in-vehicle and Rivian cloud technology road map. Our SG&A expense will increase primarily due to expected investments in our technology and commercial organization. As more of our vehicles hit the road, it's important we continue to invest in all aspects of our business that makes the digital-first ownership experience seamless and enjoyable. We plan to continue investing in our business throughout 2022, and therefore, expect an increase in capital expenditures as compared to 2021. Capital expenditures are expected to be $2.6 billion, driven by additional investment in our normal factory to expand the capacity of our R1 line to over 100,000 units annually. In addition, we expect to realize increased capital spend associated with the tooling for current vehicle platform, future vehicle manufacturing lines, battery technology and supply, our service network, digital offering and general technology. In closing, I wanted to reiterate our excitement for what we have ahead of us. Our long-term targets remain unchanged, with gross margin targets of 25%, EBITDA margin targets in the high-teens and free cash flow margin target of 10%. We expect the capital we are investing today will deliver powerful returns on investment. While the past year was filled with so many incredible milestones, we are truly just getting started. With that, let me turn the call back to RJ before opening up the line for Q&A. Thanks, Claire. We're no doubt experiencing one of the most challenging supply chain environment the automotive industry has ever seen. But as we look out 10 years from now, our products, our technology and our brand platform will help us capture substantial market share in the transportation space. I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And with that let me turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open Hi. Thanks, everybody. So RJ and Claire, during -- in your S1 late last year, you had, at the time, 55,400 orders for the R1. And you stated that you expected to deliver those vehicles by late 2023. Can you confidently reiterate that you could deliver the 55,000th R1 by late 2023 today? Hi, Adam. Yes, we can confidently say we'd be the 55,000th vehicle by the end of 2023. And as you heard from Claire and I, right now, the real constraint for our production is within the supply chain. And this has been a major focus for us. Every morning starts with thinking about which suppliers we need to go speak to and push harder on to make sure they're ramping as fast as the rest of our production line. But ultimately, our ability to ramp this year will continue to be gated by the supplier ramps. And as you know, it's not all the bill of materials. It's just a small fraction of the bill of materials where we're having some of these supplier constraints. Okay. RJ, I'm interpreting that as that you confidently reiterate that given your visibility on the supply constraints, this is how I'm interpreting that, meaning including the supply constraints. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thanks RJ. Just as a follow-up, how many EDVs have you delivered to Amazon to date have actually been delivered and are in service? So as you heard, Adam, we're in the process on EDV of ramping the production. And the production ramp on that vehicle is actually going a lot smoother than what we've seen on R1. And it's really capturing a lot of the lessons learned and a lot of the sort of organizational capabilities that we've built on the ramp-up of R1. And so, as we think about EDV, it is outrunning the supply chain by a significant degree today. So the vehicles that we're producing, we're using really to refine, as you heard from us, some of the software and integration, the digital integration with an Amazon system. So, we really look at the second quarter to see significant ramp-up of the EDV. Okay. RJ, thanks for that. So, I'm interpreting that as there really aren't any significant numbers in the fleet right now. They're being built and up-fitted and improved and optimized in the factory, and we won't expect any -- I won't expect any material amount of EDV deliveries. I won't see them in neighborhoods delivering packages, for example, until sometime in the second quarter. Is that incorrect? Is that correct? Well, I guess it depends on which neighborhoods you're in. But right now, we have a number of vehicles that are deployed as part of this testing pilot fleet. But in terms of significant scale, that's right, we wouldn't see significant scale until second quarter of this year. Thanks, RJ. Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just to push a little bit harder on this volume number. I mean RJ, as you look at the supply disruption right now, I wonder if you could give us maybe a little bit more color about specific parts, is it semis, or we've heard just general malaise and snarl in supply chains. And then two, why you think this means ultimately for line expectations as we get beyond 2022 into 2023. Because I think generally, there's an expectation to do 100,000 units-plus in 2023. So I mean, I think you're talking about capacity to do 50,000 units right now on a tooled basis. I mean do you think on a tooled basis, the supply chain gets -- issues get worked out that you could do something like 100,000 units in 2023? Yes. Thanks, John. We're working as hard as we can to get the suppliers ramped. And as you said, certainly, the vast majority of our suppliers have been keeping up with the production ramp in the plant. And as the production rates continue to increase within our facility, the constraints within the supply base become even more apparent. And we have resources focused on any of those constraints to make sure we do everything we possibly can to expand our component supply because, ultimately, our goal is to deliver as many vehicles as we possibly can this year. And as you heard from Claire, we’re not for supplier constraints, we're confident we could achieve in excess of 50,000 vehicles this year. So what we've done is on these few areas where we do have constraints, we're working very closely, meaning we have our teams on site with those suppliers, in some cases, helping to operate certain shifts. In other cases where we've had third parties that are coming in to help improve the efficiency and the efficacy of those operations. But the areas that I just point that we're seeing more challenging as we ramp really are within the semiconductor space, the wire harness space and within the electronic space at some of the CMs, the contract manufacturers that are building the printed circuit boards for us. And so in each of those, there's different constraints. As you can imagine, in the semiconductor space, a lot of that is dealing with allocation. In the harness space, for our case, these harnesses are coming out of Mexico. There's a number of labor challenges there, many of which have been exacerbated by COVID. And that's very similar to some of the compute platforms as we start to get to much higher volumes. So there's a bit of a ripple effect of some of the component shortages that then feed into the assembly of those components into printed circuit boards. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a second question on the pricing peripheral. I mean, I think you guys have -- from my personal view, underpriced your products even before supply chain issues and inflation and everything because you have a very, very good product. So I think you kind of underestimated your own success here. Have you read anything into the folks that you haven't heard complain about the price increases and the people that have still ordered after the price increases? And do you think -- forget about the input cost inflation, that there might be even more opportunity on pricing on your vehicle. Because I mean, from my vantage point, you're a high-end Jeep Wrangler to somewhere or a high-end Range Rover. And I think you really have kind of maybe undershot structurally what you could do on pricing, forget about market dynamics at the moment, just based on the product itself. So I mean, one, what have you read, which we haven't heard? Two, people you -- have ordered post pricing increases? And three, do you think there might be even more room on pricing just because of the product itself? Yes, John, we spent a lot of time looking at our pricing model. And as you heard from me, a big part of the new pricing model was to make sure we could really ingest our dual-motor and our standard battery pack within our price range, as you heard, from $67,500 up through $90,000-plus. And so with that now portfolio of three different drive -- or three different battery packs and two different drive configurations, we have a really nice mix of options for our customers and mix of configurations for our customers. And when you take a step back and look at the product at the new pricing levels, it is very competitively priced. If you look at our SUV, this is a three-row SUV with the large pack and the dual-motor, it's 0 to 60 in under four seconds. Over 320 miles in range. A true proper three-row vehicle with a lot of space for storage. I've been driving one now for over three months, incredibly fun. My wife and I love it. So I mean the products themselves, as you said, are exceptional, and we are seeing tremendous demand. Now since announcing the new pricing, we've also seen really no change in the rate at which pre-orders are coming in. And so customers also really see the value proposition, and it's really been validated and confirmed over the last week by seeing the continued influx of demand and, as we like to think about it, the continued growing backlog of demand. Okay. That's great. Yes. No, I just think there was -- I think you may even have more room than you think, but that's a high-class problem to have. Thanks so much for the time. Thanks, John. Thank you. Your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi everybody. Just on the supplier issues, I understand the types of things that you're doing to help suppliers, but can you give us a sense of the visibility into bringing those constrained suppliers into where they need to be. So the suppliers of semis and wire harnesses and electronics that they are an issue, are they are they giving you a kind of a high confidence schedule at this point? And just give us a sense of the -- what that looks like? Yes. Thanks, Rod. It really depends on the commodity area and on the supplier. And something like a wire harness or an ECU that's being built at a CM, at a contract manufacturer, in those situations, we have teams that are on site. We have very incredibly high -- an incredible high level of visibility into their operations, into the way in which they're running their business. And we have very close and transparent relationships with them. And on those, we're able to essentially build crisp line of sight, over the next several quarters of production. Now with that said, the challenge within the semiconductor space is there's a lot more unknowns there. And it's very different than, let's say, a wire harness production facility where we can put key members on the ground at the wire harness facility where we can actually help, we can actually assess. We're not able to send folks into foundries or send folks into semiconductor manufacturing sites to do the same type of hands-on support and/or auditing. So in that regard, I'm spending a lot of time and the rest of our senior leadership team is spending a lot of time with our semiconductor suppliers, and making sure we're securing the right allocation. And that allocation, as we start to get into higher production rates, especially in the back half of this year, is where we see risk. And it's what's caused us to make the adjustments to what we're guiding to in terms of production for this year. But I want to be very, very clear. We are pushing very hard on those suppliers. And if any of those suppliers are listening in here, you're going to continue to -- those suppliers will continue to hear from us. And we're going to be continuing to push very hard to get those numbers as high as possible, because they are constraining us. And it's quite painful when we see our production plants, really ramping and the lines running as we intend to have to throttle production because of those shortages of those parts. So this is something we're laser-focused on. A morning doesn't go by, where it's not a topic of conversation for us as a management team. Okay. And you said that you're now at 2x the 2021 exit rate of production. Can you just tell us specifically what that means? What is the production per day? And what kind of cadence are you expecting over the course of this year? So if I look at 50,000 units a year, it looks like it would correspond eventually to something like 170 per week, on a -- or 770 a day on a six-day week and 50 weeks a year. Do you think you would get there towards the end of this year? Again, ultimately, the rate at which we can produce is going to be gated by the number of components that we have. One of the things that's given us the confidence around the production ramp is the way we've been validating our production equipment, production lines and also making sure we're training our teams whilst accumulating enough parts to run the lines at their intended rate. So we may have not run one day during the week or we may finish a shift early because we're operating the lines at a much higher rate. So because of that, our lines are sitting still far more often than we'd like because we're waiting on components. So that gives us the confidence to state here that we see the ramp continuing to improve, but it is going -- or continuing to climb, but it's going to be limited, as I said, by unlocking some of these key components. Okay. But there surely is some schedule that you have in your own mind and embedded in that 25,000 unit forecast. Can you just give us a sense of what that cadence looks like just so that we can get a sense of what your expectations are for the ramp of your suppliers? So as you said, we're running at twice the rate of what our exit velocity was, our exit rate was for 2021. We will continue to climb. But ultimately, that 25,000 implies that we're up against a ceiling of supply, if you will. But that ceiling is something we're working very hard to remove so that we can continue ramping and continue getting more vehicles to customers. Okay. Just chiming in and provide a little bit more color on that point as well. As we think through the volumes for the year, we'd expect that those volumes would be more back half-weighted as we think about where we are in the S curve today and the trajectory of the manufacturing plant and making sure that our supply chain partners are also ramping their weekly output in lockstep with Rivian's, so that we can hold the rate that the production facility can deliver across the board. And so as we think about the cadence of the quarters for the year, I would think about us in this next quarter closing out Q1 and moving into Q2, starting to prioritize more of this and has been build into -- so that's sort of also part and parcel of slope of the curve that you could expect as you see us accelerating into the back half of the year. And the other important dimension here as well is really the cadence of the RCV platform as well, given some of the seasonality of Amazon, there's a heavy push for us to really ramp production throughout the course of Q2 and Q3, and then taper as they think about sort of their high season, which is sort of heading into that holiday period. So very much kind of a big push as we think about building up production into Q3 to deliver on that 25,000-plus unit. Okay. Just to clarify, two times your production rate from the exit rate, are you talking something like 50 or 60 a day? Just to put some kind of a metric on where you're running right now. Can you share that? I would just say we're not going to get into the habit of providing daily production rates. And I think as you rightfully have seen on our last earnings call, we gave you numbers and you could sort of benchmark until the overall daily production in those last handful of weeks of last quarter. But I just wanted to make sure we were providing sort of that overall visibility into the progress we're making. Okay. Got you. Thank you. And next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Relative to the earlier planned 17% to 20% price increase for current reservation holders, is this price increase needed to offset inflationary pressure, since the time of the IPO in order to meet the financial expectations you may have had at that time? And does that imply then that margin might now be lower than previously contemplated, at least until such time as you begin selling the new orders that you take at the higher price? And does this mean that prices, yes, in the out years will now be higher than previously contemplated, which could imply that volumes might be lower than previously contemplated? Or maybe because there's a general inflationary environment, including for battery metals and competitor vehicles, too, that kind of offset the impact of volume? How are you thinking about these different factors? Sure. As your question indicates, there are many different factors that are driving what we both experienced over the last handful of months, in regards to the inflationary pressures in the market. But I think, as you heard in John's question as well, right, there's still a phenomenal value proposition for the vehicles, even at the revised pricing levels that we put out to the market, which, again, as RJ mentioned and touched upon, is really reinforced by the overall demand that we've seen post-pricing increase for those vehicles across the board. And as we think about, what's changed since that time of IPO right, we have both the largest factor here in these early stages of production is actually volume and rate. And so as you think about the fact that we have 150,000 units of annualized capacity at our plant in Normal, Illinois, and instead of higher volumes, as we had indicated, right, we have the ability to produce 50,000 units this year, the fact that we're supply constrained to 25,000 units this year is actually the most highly sensitive variable as you think about the impact on our gross margin. And so the supply chain environment is a key factor in regards to the margin rate that we expect to have. Inflation also has clearly been a factor here as well. Rivian is not alone in regards to the overall raw material input prices that are obviously impacting EVs across the board. And will continue to impact this base overall. I think that the important takeaway here is, right, our long-term targets are unchanged. We still have tremendous conviction around our ability to deliver against our 25% long-term gross profit margin, and we'll continue to see that opportunity. And importantly, as we think about the components of that margin, as we've talked about in the past, it's not just the vehicles we're providing, but importantly, it's the software and services and recurring revenue streams that we can earn, our post-initial purchase that helps us deliver that 25% margin and the opportunity to move overtime even beyond those levels. So in closing, I would just say that, right, we feel as though our vehicles are competitively priced today. We see tremendous demand in that backdrop. And as we look at the long-term, we see really no change to the overall margin trajectory and opportunity we have. Great to hear. Thanks so much. And then just lastly, what are your thoughts on that battery and metals cost inflation? How do you think the increase in the price of nickel, which seems like it could be, hopefully in large part, temporary, but some of the other metals, too? How do you think that impacts the competitiveness of EVs versus ICE vehicles, understanding, too, that ICE vehicles have their own palladium and platinum and catalytic converter inflation problem to worry about as well. Do you have a sense for how these like competing inflationary cost pressures might net out and what the resulting impact could be on EV sales or EV penetration of total industry sales? Ryan, as you said, we hope the inflation that nickel pricing very recently is short-lived. But the reality is there's going to continue to be movements around commodity pricing and it's going to be across a variety of commodities, whether you're looking at some of the commodities that go into catalysts, as you said, in an ICE vehicle versus, let's say, nickel and a battery cell. But I'd also point out, and I talked about this earlier, that we're developing a portfolio of battery solutions, inclusive of lithium ion phosphate and LFP pack. And one of the nice things about having multiple different chemistries across our portfolio is it essentially provides a bit of a hedge around some of the different materials that go into different battery chemistries, in this case, of course, referring to nickel. But these are -- this is something we're paying very close attention to. We fully recognize and fully analyze the implications of some of these different materials and the pricing of those materials, how that will be translated into our margin structure. Very helpful. Thank you. And your next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks everyone. I guess to start, maybe -- can you just give us some color on what you actually saw in terms of cancellations and recouping of those orders from the pricing decision. I mean, I know reading message boards can lead you to a dark place, but you probably have better information than the rest of us. And then it's good to hear about the good rate on preorders since the pricing change. But can you give us some context? Is that in more for the new dual motor standard pack? Or are customers still also opting for the original cloud motor? Yes, absolutely. So on 31, when we announced the new prices, we did see increased rate of cancellations in that 24-hour period between the price announcement and when we roll those prices back. But right after the reversals, we got massive reinstatement requests, and more than half of our customers requested to reinstate. So what we basically saw was the demand continues to be very robust and -- both from a reinstatement point of view as well as from the new orders point of view, as RJ mentioned. The rate at which the new orders are coming in is very comparable and similar to the rate at which the orders were coming in before our pricing announcement. So we -- it sort of validates the pricing model that we had shared with the world. And I think we continue to be very confident at the competitiveness of our product and how it's going to result in the growth of our backlog and demand going forward. Joe, just to add a bit to that. I want to be clear that certainly, as you said, if you look at some of the online surveys, you come out with a very different perspective on what the canceling rate was. The decision we took was to ultimately honor the original configuration pricing, wasn't due to any cancellations, but rather was really because we have such a focus on our brand and the relationship we have with customers. They're -- this wasn't driven by some mass cancellation, but rather the recognition that the brand we're building is the foundation, is the platform upon, which ultimately we're going to be selling millions of different vehicles per year across different vehicle types and of course, across different markets. And these early customers are such a critical part of what we're building as an organization. Yes, I would agree with that sentiment. As a second question, with the standard LFP packs that you mentioned in the opening remarks, will those be the Rivian-produced packs? Or are those still going to be sourced? So great question, Joe. And we've talked about this a bit in the past. The way we've approached our battery cells and I'd say broadly, our approach to battery packs is you could really look at it across two arms. On one side, we're developing relationships with cell suppliers where we co-invest in capacity. And that may be high nickel cells like what we've launched with in the vehicles thus far. But it also includes LFP cells, which is actually what we're going to be launching later this year. But in parallel to that, and as your question implied, we're also developing in-house battery chemistries and in-house production capability. When I say in-house, that's entirely in-house, not through a joint venture or through a partnership structure. But the LFP that's first launching later this year, that's a cell that we've sourced through a partner and a cell that we're going to be building in that close partnership. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Okay, great. Thanks guys. So maybe first question, a quick one. Any chance you'd be willing to give a general idea of the mix breakdown, R1 versus the Amazon van in that 25,000 units? What I would say is that the overall mix relatively hasn't changed from our original thoughts or forecasts overall. Okay. Fair enough. So I hate to harp on this, I mean you're probably sick of talking about it and thinking about it. But obviously, supply chain, this is pain, it's coming through very clearly. I'm just wondering, if you take a step back and think about this strategically, philosophically, if you would have known everything that you know today, if you would have known this two years, three years ago and you were initially formulating your supply chain strategy, what would you have done differently? And looking forward to the plant that you have coming up in Georgia, how will you apply those learnings to that future product rollout? Or maybe you won't. Maybe you don't have any regrets about the way you've approached things. And I'd just be interested in hearing how you address that question? Thanks. Yes. It's a great question, Alex. And we certainly have spent time saying how do we avoid some of these supplier constraints going forward. There's a couple of things I'd note here. And in the context of semiconductors, one of the challenges is we have a supply-demand imbalance as an industry. And as a result of that, suppliers are providing platforms or components on an allocation basis, and those allocations are largely being set at some multiple of last year's demand. And, of course, what we've seen is all the sources of demand, all the OEMs, in this case, are asking largely for more than the need. And so the semiconductor suppliers are then developing their own allocation models that essentially reference what they believe the real true demand is. So the challenge we have in this regard is we have to -- we don't have something to look back to, to say what was Q1 of 2021, like in terms of our demand profile. And with each of these semiconductor providers, we need to give them the confidence that we're capable of ramping. And of course, each semiconductor supplier asks, well, how -- if I'm semiconductor supplier X, how is semiconductor supplier Y doing, and wanting to sort of make sure that, their rate of supply and the allocation that they're providing to us is roughly equal to the rate of allocation that's coming from other semiconductor suppliers. So, it's a bit of almost like a game of scheduled chicken, if you will, between these different suppliers. And so, we've taken the approach of being very transparent and I guess, to be explicit, to being very aggressive with these suppliers to make sure we're driving them. And it's why I said earlier, for any of those suppliers that happen to be on this call, we're going to continue to push very hard. And that's critical for us as we go into next year. And as we think about future launches, we'll have the benefit of having proven demand and proven output. Now with all that said, our next-generation network architecture that I referred to before, actually helps simplify this problem where we are consolidating a number of our RCVs and we're doing that in close partnership with the semiconductor suppliers where as we source these, we're basically making sure that this doesn't happen again. So there's -- the way we're setting up the contracts, the way we're negotiating pricing, the way we're negotiating the purchase process, we're ensuring that the things that we previously treated as more of a commodity, we now treat as a strategic sourcing agreement and an agreement in which we won't have these kinds of surprises that we've just gone through. Now with that said, around semiconductors, I'd say the other area that we've -- as we go forward, that I think we've learned from here is sometimes these macroeconomic environments are just hard to plan for. And the need to take an approach of being very hands on. And if previously, you would look at the supply base and say, it's a trust but verify, and maybe there was 80% trust, 20% verify. I think for the industry at large, certainly for ourselves, we're taking a much more heavy-handed approach to the supplier ramp-up process where we'll have folks on site much earlier in the process, making sure the suppliers are hiring the teams they need to hire, setting up their supply chain, so that's their Tier 2s and associated Tier 3s, appropriately and being very much more heavy handed in that audit and ramp-up process. And so, we certainly are doing that now. And I referred to it before, but we have a team of people dedicated to being on site and to working very closely with these suppliers. We're going to be increasingly aggressive on that as we go forward because we do view this as a critical core competency to make sure future ramps are as -- occur as fast as possible. Thanks RJ, and that’s super helpful. I’ll now pass on. Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. I was first hoping to better understand the production outlook of 25,000. One of the things we've seen for the industry broadly is a lot of unexpected issues have come off, suppliers can't meet the forecast that they provided. So, I'm hoping to better understand to what extent you're incorporating additional unexpected disruptions that may occur this year within that 25,000 production target? And I guess, if everybody delivered to plan, would the number actually end up being more than 25,000? Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're certainly working as hard as we can to exceed that 25,000. And when we put that guidance together, we did it fully contemplating all the constraints that we see today as well as the -- where we see potential issues over the course of the next year. Of course, saying that and given the large number of unknowns and uncertainty in the system, it's impossible to predict everything, especially in this environment. But again, we're very focused on achieving as much as we can and fully utilizing the plant capacity that we have installed and the plant capacity that we've demonstrated thus far. Understood. My second question was on the materials inflationary environment. I'm hoping to better understand that as well. Can you talk about to what extent you've been able to lock in any of the pricing, either in terms of financial hedges or fixed-price contracts? I think typically, in the industry, there's a lot of commodities pass through. And so it sounds like Rivian would be exposed to the higher materials cost if they do, in fact, stay at current levels. But hoping to better understand if you've been able to offset any of that? Thank you. It's a good question, Mark. I think as we think about structuring and as we -- I should say, as we structured our supplier contracts leading into our launches across all three products, the R1T, the R1S and EDV, a lot of those contracts are tied to a component or a part or a system at a fixed price. So there's not a raw material pass-through. Of course, there are some contracts that have raw material pass-throughs, and it's really dependent on the type of contract and the type of component or system. The component of our systems, where a vast majority of the price of that item is carried by the commodity price, there may be those pass-throughs. But a lot of systems, most of the price is actually carried in the value-add on top of the raw material. So take, for example, a headlight as an example. Much of the headlight cost is actually the processing of the materials as opposed to the raw materials themselves. Now exceptions to that and examples where that's a bit different, of course, and we've talked about this already, really around the battery cell and so we see this with nickel. It's one of the reasons we're so focused on nickel. And I think I'm sure all of our colleagues across the industry are also very focused on this, because those types of contracts typically do have some level of some level of commodity pricing baked in. Thank you. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I will pass the call back to RJ Scaringe for his final remarks. Thank you. Well, I appreciate everybody joining us for this call, and we enjoyed the questions and the discussion. We look forward to future discussions. Thanks so much. And with that, we conclude our program.

Welcome to the Rivian First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Rivian’s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today’s call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today’s shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity; industry’s trends; business operations; strategy and goals; our second domestic manufacturing facility; our future products, including R2; and our expectations regarding vehicle deliveries.
Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. Except as maybe required by law, Rivian does not have any obligation to update or revise such statements if circumstances change. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could impact actual results, please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings and today’s shareholder letter, which can be found on our website at rivian.com/investors. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today’s shareholder letter.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. We are happy to be here with everyone today and look forward to discussing the progress we have been making. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we’ll cover on today’s call.
As of May 9, we have produced approximately 5,000 vehicles since the start of production. We are now producing and delivering the R1T, R1S, and EDV 700, with a slightly narrower and shorter EDV 500 going through final production trials now. And we’ve done all this in one of the most challenging operating environments in decades. We have $17 billion of cash and believe we have a clear path to launch R2 in Georgia in 2025 with our current cash on hand.
Our goal is to build and scale a large business that addresses both the consumer and commercial markets. Our launch of the R1 and EDV products positions us to grow rapidly as we fully ramp the 150,000 units of installed capacity in our Normal, Illinois manufacturing facility. We have a lot of work ahead, but the passion and endorsement we have seen from customers and third-parties, such as being named MotorTrend’s 2022 Truck of the Year demonstrates the impact our team can drive as we remain laser-focused on ramping production and getting more vehicles on the road.
With regard to our production, we are encouraged by the acceleration of our demonstrated production rate. Our plant is now achieving cycle times 3x higher than the start of the year. These demonstrated production rates, which we expect to continue to increase, coupled with our current supply chain outlook, give us confidence in our ability to hit our targets for 2022. Equally important, demand continues to accelerate. And as of May 9, we had over 90,000 preorders for our R1 products in the U.S. and Canada. All of our orders have been attracted by organic growth and brand awareness and without any paid marketing or media.
It is worth noting that since our March 1 price increase, we have received over 10,000 R1 preorders for the U.S. and Canadian market with an average price of over $93,000. These orders are in addition to the 100,000 commercial van order from Amazon. As we ramp production and deliveries of EDVs, we are excited about the impact that our close partnership with Amazon will have in the commercial vehicle space. As we have begun ramping deliveries, the feedback has been tremendous. One of my favorite parts of the week is when I sync with our customer engagement team and hear the feedback they are receiving around the vehicle, process and their interactions with our team. We love seeing photos of our vehicles in the wild, enabling customers’ adventures.
Our core focus as an organization for 2022 is to get more R1s and EDVs on the road. The majority of our time is focused on ensuring our teams are driving towards ramping production and deliveries to customers. Core to this is addressing the supply constraints that we have dealt with thus far. And I’m very confident today in the relationships and associated commitment we have built with our suppliers. As we demonstrate our production ramp, our suppliers are leaning in to help ensure we can achieve our targets.
Before handing off to Claire, I want to comment on our R2 program, which is being developed and planned for our Georgia facility. We are leveraging the many learnings from our R1 and RCV platforms and we are working to ensure the R2 sets a high bar in terms of affordability, unit economics, performance and efficiency. This global platform is critical for our long-term growth with a lower price point to further expand our addressable market. R2 will also leverage many of the cross-platform technologies that will be incorporated into R1 and RCV platforms, including our single-motor drive unit, which we call Enduro, and our next-generation network architecture and associated family of ECUs. I couldn’t be more excited about the ramp of the R1 and EDV vehicles as well as the products, services and technologies we have in the pipeline.
With that, I will hand it over to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I’ll start with a review of our first quarter 2022 results. In Q1, we produced 2,553 vehicles and delivered 1,227 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $95 million of revenue generated in the quarter. As we’ve discussed in the past, the volumes being produced on our manufacturing lines are a small fraction of our current 150,000 units of annual capacity.
We generated negative gross profit of $502 million in the quarter. As we ramp production, we expect high fixed costs associated with running our large-scale, highly vertically integrated facility will continue to impact our total gross profit. Our negative gross margin was impacted by inflation and the production of low quantities of vehicles on large-scale production lines as we ramp. This includes the costs associated with expedited shipping expense, labor and depreciation as well as some accounting adjustments such as lower of cost or net realizable value, LCNRV. As discussed on prior calls, the LCNRV adjustment writes down the value of certain inventory to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale.
As we ramp production, we expect to leverage our labor and other fixed costs to drive improved gross margin per vehicle. While our operations teams worked diligently to ramp production of the R1T, R1S and EDV 700, our customer engagement, service and delivery teams are also accelerating efforts to enhance customer experience across the country. Additionally, our engineering and design teams continue to progress on our next-generation in-vehicle technology. Our vertically integrated approach is designed to drive long-term structural cost advantages as we expand our production and product road map.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was negative $1.1 billion. We continue to strategically invest in our plant in Normal, Illinois, lab facilities and service operations. We also expect to begin investing additional capital into our Georgia facility later this year. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $418 million. We ended the quarter with $17 billion of cash. While we operate a capital-intensive business, we have a high level of flexibility regarding the cadence of our growth investments.
As RJ mentioned, our current priority is ramping the 150,000 units of R1 and EDV capacity to meet the tremendous demand we have for these products. We have optimized our product road map and associated operating expenses and believe we have a clear path to launch R2 in Georgia in 2025 with our current cash on hand. We are also reaffirming our 2022 full year guidance of 25,000 total vehicles produced. We anticipate a significant acceleration of production throughout the second half of the year as our demonstrated capacity improves and we accelerate the ramp-up of key shops.
In addition, we are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $4.75 billion and capital expenditure guidance of $2.6 billion. Our outlook does not assume a material change in the overall operating environment. Going forward, we plan to provide production and delivery results shortly after the quarter end. We will no longer be providing intra-quarter production and preorder figures.
In closing, I want to thank our team, community, customers and suppliers for another successful quarter. Thanks to our truly differentiated vehicle and technology platform, we’re seeing such tremendous feedback and enthusiasm. We have a steep climb ahead of us, but I couldn’t be more confident with the plan that we have and the path that we are on.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. Sure, ma’am. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Good evening, everybody. Just a first question around production versus deliveries in the quarter, production is essentially almost 2x of deliveries. I am just curious why there was such a gap between the two this quarter. Was it just a question of timing of vehicles in transit or what’s going on there? Because traditionally, because of the lack of the dealer network, we kind of assume they are going to be a lot closer. Thanks, John. Yes, as you said in the question, there is a gap between production deliveries and it was just that the timing effect of vehicles being built and being in transit and essentially prepped for delivery. As you said, given that we have a direct model where we sell vehicles directly to consumers, aligning up those customers, ensuring the delivery, creating a great customer experience, there is always going to be some separation between the total production number and the number of deliveries. Okay, but it was nothing other than simply just processing, RJ? There is not like there is vehicles being held for any kind of quality or postproduction inspection or anything like that? No. In fact, when we talk about production numbers, what we are referring to is vehicles that are factory-gated. So, these have gone through a full quality inspection process. This doesn’t – production numbers do not include any partially complete vehicles. These are fully ready-to-deliver to customer vehicles. Super helpful. One point that I would just add on to that question is that because of the rate at which we are ramping production, because we are continuously scaling week over week over week, there always will be that lag effect in regard to vehicles that are ultimately in transit. So it’s something that we will continue, but won’t likely to be the same sort of percentage of ratio of produced vehicles relative to delivery. Got it. And then just a second question on the run-rate of production, I mean it seems like there is about 1,800 units that were produced from April 1 to May 9 roughly. And I have to do some dumb guy’s math and just double it, that gets you to 3,600, but that doesn’t even give you the benefit for the full quarter and the acceleration. So, it seems like you are on pace to hit at least, at least in our model, 4,000 units plus in the second quarter. Is that kind of reasoning about correct? And I mean, just given that you are getting a good acceleration in production here, it seems like you might be even ahead of that. Should we think about it that way? And is there any tempering of parts specifically that might gate your ability to get there? That’s about the right way to look at it. I’d want to point out a couple of things. We have seen the overall production rate continue to increase. In fact, our cycle time has seen a 3x – 300% or 3x improvement since the start of the year through the course of Q1 and we continue to see that production rate improvement as we go through quarter two here. So, you alluded to it, but we are in midst of S curve. So the end of the quarter, we will be producing at a faster rate than the start of the quarter. As we look at this quarter thus far, we have – the plant has been able to outproduce our supply chain. And what gives us a lot of confidence as we look at the time ahead is the clear line of sight we have around the ramp up of our supply chain and the close relationships we have with those key suppliers. Okay. And then just the last question on pricing and the price increases, I mean, obviously, the result of input cost increases, but is there margin that goes along with these price increases? More specifically, maybe are you raising your prices exactly to what your cost is or is it above that, so there is actually some sort of parallel margin that’s going along with it on a unit basis? Right. So the way I would think about the margin opportunity that we have and you will really see this kick in from an inflection point as you think about the 2024 margin opportunity that we have, which brings together the combination of us really ramping and accelerating the production volumes within the plant, combined with the move from our sort of pre-March 1 preorder cohorts, your post March 1 cohort. And embedded in that post-March 1 cohort, there is a true step change that you will see in regard to the overall aggregate gross margin that you will see within the business. And so the growth from a gross profit margin rate over time, it’s not linear, it truly is a step change function as you think about us moving to this post-March 1 cohort.
And as we talked about a bit in our shareholder letter as well, we are also now moving towards a reservation system versus the historical preorder system that we have had, which allows us to have the customer configure their vehicle closer to the delivery date, which enables us to understand the dynamics within the inflationary market at that time, but also importantly, ensure that, that customer has all of the core vehicle capabilities that we are introducing in that configuration as well. So, we think that the combination of those two factors will really help us from an ongoing margin perspective and allow us to really be nimble and dynamic as we evaluate this inflationary backdrop. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi. Claire, I just wanted to follow up. You mentioned, if I quote, you have a high level of flexibility in the cadence of your growth investments. So on the topic of cost control, your enterprise value is currently just above $0. And it’s sending the message – the market is sending the message that if you don’t get your supply chain costs under control that you might have to significantly dilute shareholders. That’s what happens when you see a zero enterprise value. Now, you reiterated the 25,000 units delivery target and the $7 billion plus kind of cash burn or EBITDA and CapEx. So my question is, if you had to control cash consumption of the business due to force majeure events outside of your control and you alluded to flexibility in cadence, but could you elaborate what levers could you pull to slow the burn and give you more runway to execute and restore confidence in Rivian in the capital markets? Thanks. Thanks for that question, Adam. As you mentioned, we are clearly in the driver seat with $17 billion of cash on hand. And it’s important to also note that we have made foundational investments that have allowed us to rapidly scale the business in both the consumer as well as the commercial market. We have 150,000 units of capacity for our R1 and RCV platforms. And as we have talked about as well, demand remains incredibly strong with over 90,000 R1 preorders and an initial order of 100,000 units from Amazon. And as we just talked a little bit about with John’s previous question, right, we do see significant path forward as we are ramping production and able to ultimately have that step change where we are now harvesting, right, the profitability of all of those foundational investments that we have made in the production capacity that’s online and the launch vehicles that we have come to market with. And so, this ultimately gives us that flexibility to decide how we are deploying our capital on a go-forward basis. And as you mentioned, with regard to what those key levers are, we have the ability to live within our means as we think about the profitability that normal itself can deliver for Rivian that will allow us to really pace the ongoing growth of the business and ultimately allows us to have that flexibility on when and how we would raise additional capital on a go-forward basis. And as we talked a little bit about, we do believe we have the cash on hand to launch... I understand. I understand, Claire. Let me just do one follow-up and I will shut up. For you and RJ, since your IPO, the world has changed dramatically. Investors just don’t want to fund negative EBITDA growth – EBITDA companies in this environment and the supply chain issues have gotten, to your point, significantly worse in both quantity and input cost. So has anything changed in your team’s strategy to adapt to the changes in the environment since the IPO? Yes, Adam, this has been something we, as a leadership team, have spent a tremendous amount of time on, of course, from a scenario planning point of view, but also just looking at the product road map and how we plan to invest and deploy capital over the coming years. And as Claire said, one of the really important things for us to recognize here is we have $17 billion in cash. We have 150,000 units of capacity with CapEx that’s installed. And it positions us well to now harvest and use that to leverage or create a significant amount of growth while we focus investment and focus our dollars on development and preparation for launch of R2. So what we’ve really done is and what we’ve been working hard on is to channel and focus our capital on a really important program from us in terms of trust and in terms of scaling, which is the R2 program, but of course, maintaining laser focus on ramping up the existing capacity that we have, such that we can fully, as Claire said, harvest the revenue associated with it. Thanks, RJ. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. RJ, you alluded to some better visibility with your suppliers. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color and detail on some of those conversations with those suppliers that you mentioned had some bottlenecks last quarter that gives you that level of confidence. Sure. So we previously talked in our last call around some of the challenges we’ve had, inclusive of semiconductors as well as some other components. And where we stand today, a lot of those other challenges have been resolved. We’ve worked with those suppliers to ramp their production. We have clear line of sight to them being able to keep up with our continued ramp in our facility. As we noted in our opening statements, just the importance of us shifting to – or moving to a two-shift operation mid this year and of course, the suppliers seem to be capable of supporting that. With that said, we also have very tight relationships with the semiconductor suppliers, and we’ve seen some – we believe we’ve seen really the worst of it or sort of the valley, if you will, of these supply constraints. And the suppliers are leaned in. We have very high levels of visibility into what the allocations will be on a go-forward basis. And that gives us the confidence of what the ramp will look like as we look out through the remainder of this year. Okay. And then just maybe to follow-up on Adam’s point about scenario planning and changing the strategy. Your answer made it seem like you’re being prudent about how you spend for next-generation platforms. I guess what I’m wondering is your plan involved doing a lot of things on your own or in-sourced and then throughout really the entire value chain. Has this experience and the change in capital markets led you to reevaluate whether you might rely on other partners or any sort of a bow face in terms of what you want to do versus you might let others do for you as you want to – as you go and sort of execute upon your longer-term plan? There is a few things to think about here, Joe. So first is our original plan had a number of additional variants, both of the R1 product as well as even propulsion platforms that were planned for the future pipeline. And what we’ve done is we’ve really looked at the incredible level of demand that we have for the R1 products as they are and recognize that there is some big technology development efforts to further advance those products, but we’ve aligned those very nicely with the R2 program. So our, what we call Enduro, this is the single-motor drive unit that’s used in the EDV platform in a front-drive application and in the R1 platform in a dual-motor or all-wheel drive application, our next-generation network architecture and associated family of ECUs, and of course, our LFP battery pack, which is going to be launching in the EDV later this year. All those technologies, we’re able to share those, not only across the R1 and RSV platforms, but a number of them really lined up nicely with the R2 program.
And so what we’ve been focused on is simplifying the product plan and the product portfolio as much as possible. But we haven’t, in any way at all, shifted our focus on the need to vertically integrate our software stack, vertically integrate around our electronics and ECU topology and of course, vertically integrate around our propulsion stack. So we do believe those are really important from both a structural cost point of view, but also from a product attribute and feature point of view, but we have simplified the overall product set. And we’ve done that in a way that, as you’ve heard us talk about here, it puts us in the driver seat, so to speak, in terms of controlling our need for additional capital and ensures that we’re able to launch R2 with the capital that we have. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. First one super quick point of clarification. You mentioned your reservation having received 10,000 reservations since the price changes, but then obviously, the latest update at 90,000 is only up 7,000 or so versus the last update. So what are you exactly netting out of this? Is it the cancellation or the deliveries that you’ve already done? So the net is both of those things. So our – when we report net preorders, every delivered vehicle that we have comes out of that base of preorders. And so it is the netting effect of the delivered vehicles that we’ve had throughout both last quarter as well as the quarter-to-date period as well as any embedded churn within the preorder base. Okay. That’s very helpful. Then your target to launch R2 in 2025 with current cash on hand is obviously very encouraging. How do you plan on accomplishing this? Are you modifying the CapEx trajectory? Are you – have you identified areas where you need to spend less capital? Do you anticipate lower operational cash burn than previously anticipated? I guess, how will you do that? Sure. As we mentioned, one of the core catalysts that enable this path forward to launch R2 in Georgia with our cash on hand is both the profitability that we’re going to begin to deliver with the installed – 150,000 units of installed capacity that we have in Normal. It’s also important to note, as we think about Georgia, we’re building Georgia in a modular fashion. And so the first phase of Georgia will be an R2 line with 200,000 units, and that first 200,000 units will be what comes online in 2025. And so instead of building the full 400,000 units at once, that is certainly an embedded CapEx savings within the plan and forecast that we’re thinking about.
And additionally, as you heard from RJ, a number of the strategic decisions we’ve made to really focus and prioritize our product development road map also come with embedded CapEx savings as well as we think about the CapEx forecast over the next handful of years. Understood. Very finally, how is the ramp-up of the Amazon van deliveries going? And out of the 25,000 target for the full year, how many of those would be on the commercial vehicle side? Yes. We’re excited to be producing and delivering the EDVs. As I said earlier, we’ve launched the EDV 700 in terms of what’s being delivered to Amazon. And so this is the roughly 700 cubic foot version of the van. We’re in the production trial stage of the EDV 500. But with regards to EDV 700, this involved, as we talked about in the previous call, a heavy amount of iteration and refinement with Amazon in terms of how it fits into their digital ecosystem and getting a tremendous amount of driver feedback through a series of trials and a series of feedback loops with drivers. So we are excited to have been through that, have made a whole host of improvements over the course of really the last year such that the deliveries that are now happening are going to start to ramp up, and you’re going to start to see a lot more of them, hopefully, coming into all of our neighborhoods delivering packages. But with that said, we haven’t provided guidance on the exact split between the R1 and the EDV product line. But broadly speaking, we would look to say well over a majority will be in the R1 with EVs making up on the order of third of total production. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Okay. Great. I had a follow-up question on vertical integration and software. Your strategy, obviously, is very clear. It’s differentiated. I mean you’re trying to layer in your own in-house software on top of your own in-house electronics, including some of the sort of boring firmware, middleware and other things that customers maybe never get a chance to see. And obviously, there is another school of thought that suggests that it’s redundant for auto brands to go so deeply into some of that behind-the-scenes software and that everybody should standardize around kind of a base level third-party system and then only differentiate at the customer-facing end of the software stack. So I guess my question for you, first of all, I want to make sure I’m articulating all that correctly. But then secondly, why do you think your strategy is right and the other ones are wrong? Yes. Thanks, Alex. It’s a great question. When you look at a product as complex as a vehicle and in particular vehicle that’s connected with the host of sensors between cameras, radar, ultrasonics, with a whole bunch of actuators, so this is suspension, braking, motors, the traditional model is to buy, as you said, a number of compute platforms, ECUs from different Tier 1 suppliers and to put all those different ECUs together. And then the OEM essentially does some part of – at least prescribes how it should be done at the application layer. From our perspective, to create a really unique customer experience, experience in which we can fully leverage all the sensors, all the hardware in the vehicle and continually improve the vehicle over time, truly improve it, more than just putting a new color on the screen, but actually going deep into the performance of the vehicle, whether that’s referring to self-driving, whether that’s referring to performance attributes or whether that’s digital characteristics or digital capabilities of the vehicle. We feel really strongly that it’s important to both develop and control the full stack. So that’s designing and developing the compute platforms across the vehicles. So that’s all the electronics. Of course, by doing that, being able to design a very efficient network architecture and then of course, within that, building all the layers of software from the low-level operating systems all the way up to the application layer.
And what’s exciting to see is the beginnings of, from a customer-facing point of view, why that matters. And so we’ve done a number of OTAs, over-the-air updates, already with customers, and these are just an early sampling of what’s to come. So, adding features like a garage door opener to the vehicle, adding enhanced self-driving features, adding additional drive modes, adding additional diagnostics platforms. So there is a host of things we can go very deep into the vehicle across platforms because all those platforms are controlled internally. And this is important, not just on the consumer side. This is also, we feel, really important on the commercial side, where it really underpins a lot of the core capabilities we embed in our FleetOS product where we can predictively analyze the need for maintenance, we can predictively manage the health of the life cycle of a vehicle. So there is a number of characteristics that are useful as well on the commercial side. Okay. Great, thanks very much. And then the second question, I guess, on Georgia and the R2. How close are you to finalizing I guess, maybe the exact bill of materials for the R2, the exact design and the layout for Georgia? It sounds like you’re working on a modular plan. I guess, anything in that regard, especially related to things like single-piece castings or any of the sort of new manufacturing techniques that we’re hearing about. How close are you to finalizing all of that in Georgia? Thanks. Well, Georgia’s process is a really interesting and exciting opportunity because it’s going to leverage the learnings we have from going through ramping all of our production operations in Normal. And in Normal, you can really think of it as two plants housed in one site. So we have the R1 production line. And then that was sort of our Gen 1 line, if you will. And then we have our RCV platform, Rivian commercial van platform. And with that separate body shop, separate general assembly. And so a number of learnings were already embedded into that second set of lines we built in Normal. And as we now look at Georgia, the opportunities to learn from a production line layout point of view as well as the product itself and pull all those together to create really a world-class product in terms of affordability, world-class product in terms of CapEx efficiency, that’s been – that is the major focus from a development point of view for the product teams and for the plant design teams. And so, what’s also important to note is that, that product coming to market in 2025 will have the time to even further encapsulate more learnings as we continue to go through ramp and as the vast majority of our organization continues to be focused on ramping up in our Normal facility between the R1T, the R1S, the EDV 700 and the EDV 500. But those learnings are certainly flowing into how we think about R2 and part simplification, part consolidation, like you mentioned with usage of castings. We certainly use castings in the R1 and RCV programs. But the opportunity to consolidate even more parts is something we’re excited about and driving those manufacturing and cost efficiencies into that product is going to be critical. Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Baird. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. RJ, you recently ranged the alarm bell in an interview around EV materials, and several of your competitors are signing direct deals with miners of lithium and other minerals. I wonder if you can articulate your strategy and how deep their relationships go that you’re developing in that field. Thanks. Thanks, George. Yes, in a recent interview, I was discussing some of the longer-term strategic challenges we’re going to face as an industry as we go from less than 10 million units being produced a year, electric vehicles being produced a year to every vehicle being produced globally becoming electric. And as we think about that, we do believe there is going to be material constraints as we get to the sort of near the end of this decade. I want to be clear, though, that as we look out over the next 5 years, we do not see any battery cell supply constraints or material risks. And the way we’ve approached our battery cell strategy as well as our far upstream raw material precursor material strategy is to make sure that we have a diversified approach. So what we’ve launched with between the R1 products and the RCV-based platform products has been a high nickel cell. It’s a cylindrical form factor. But later this year, as I mentioned, we introduced an LFP chemistry, lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which, of course, is a hedge on nickel pricing, also just inherently a lower-cost chemistry and fits beautifully as a base model configuration and certainly for a commercial vehicle fits really, really nicely. As we look at diversification, it’s not just looking at high nickel or iron-based chemistries, but also making sure that we have the right selection of cell-supplier partners, and we’re very happy with the relationships that we have and continue to grow those relationships.
Now to your question, though, to be very specific around raw material, and I think specifically here, lithium carbonate in the case of lithium iron phosphate battery cells and lithium hydroxide in the case of high nickel cells, these are really key areas, I believe, for anyone serious about achieving significant scale, multimillion vehicle per year scale to have secured supply chains around. And we’re working very hard to build those relationships and put together the right types of deals to secure these really critical precursor materials. I think everybody on this line can appreciate the risks around the material cost. We’ve seen the price of lithium hydroxide go up quite considerably over the last several months, and that’s affected everyone. So making sure that we have confidence on supply as we look out in the latter part of this decade and where we see risk of scarcity for those key precursor materials, that’s something we’re very focused on. And at a future time, we will be able to make some announcements around that. Thanks. And if I may take it to the complete other side of the spectrum and ask you about your autonomous offering, and any update there, any new learnings? And how that offering is driving future product decisions? Thanks. Sure. So, in our launch products, we have a feature we call Driver+. And sort of the core of that feature is a highway feature where essentially the vehicle is capable of driving itself. But today, that’s geo-fenced really to highways. And we have developed that platform in-house. And as we look out over time, that capability is going to continue to grow. So, we will do that with over-the-air updates where for the existing vehicles that are already delivered to customers as well as future vehicles, that feature will extend into more roads. And along with that development, which is software based, we are also upgrading and improving the hardware set. So, what we call it – what we have talked about in terms of our next-generation network architecture, this also includes with it additional compute as well as updated cameras as well as a few other sensors on the vehicle to support continued progress above and beyond the Level 2 features set that we have today. And Claire talked about this in the context of how we will be taking orders and moving to a reservation-based process. One of the reasons for that is with our demand backlog being so large, the products we will be building in 2 years will be different than the products we are building today. And when I say different, I should say these products will be improved. We will have different hardware that’s part of some of these improvements we are going to be making from a compute point of view, from a perception stack point of view and of course, along with that, the improved network architecture that will be going into these future-state products. Thanks guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Please go ahead. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, on production, the shareholder letter mentions that one reason why the weekly rate of production slowed to about 250 units, I believe, per week in the last five weeks from 350 in March or at the end of March, was that you lost 25% of your plant production due to additional stoppages. Can you just clarify what was it that forced the longer period of stoppage than you had anticipated in April? Is that now over? And is May’s production rate now back to what it was in March or even above that? Thanks Charles. I do want to clarify some things. So – while the rate that you have calculated here, the systemic slowdown in March, the actual production lines themselves both in terms of their stability as well as their production rate has continued to improve. The challenge is, as those lines have continued to improve, we have had supply constraints that haven’t allowed us to actually fully utilize them. So, as we said, of the single-shift operation that we are on today, we lost a little more than 25% of the time. So, the number of vehicles we produced to-date this quarter is almost exactly equal to the number of semiconductors we have to support all the components that go in the vehicle. So, what’s encouraging for us looking forward here is those areas we have had shortages around, we have been working very closely with the suppliers. We have demonstrated to those semi suppliers continued progress week-over-week in terms of rate. And they are very leaned in on making sure that the constraints and line-down situations we have dealt with over the last several weeks, we are going to put those behind us as we look at ramping into the remainder of this quarter and of course, through the rest of the year. And it doesn’t – a day doesn’t go by where I am not talking to the CEO or senior team of one of those key constrained suppliers. And I can say with confidence that certainly if they are listening in, we appreciate their support. But I can say here with confidence that they are as leaned in as we had hoped for. And I would say it’s a materially different situation than we had at the start of the year where the suppliers were still trying to figure out whether or not we as a company were capable of producing and ramping. We have made it very clear through our performance that the plant is capable of running. And as I said, we hope to be running a plant on two shifts starting midyear and with that, of course, building line of sight around component allocation. Okay. Thank you. And then on the 10,000 orders you have received since the price change in March at an ASP of $93,000 that seems a very rich mix. I guess it means that the vast majority is quad-motor max pack R1Ts or large pack R1S-es given that price point. Were you surprised by that? Does it match the mix of the rest of the order book, albeit obviously at the older lower prices? And do you expect to sustain that type of mix for future orders? We see – just to clarify, there is definitely – the high ASPs indicate a preference for the dual motor, as you called out, but also – I am sorry, a preference for the quad motor. But also just to clarify, the large pack, our middle-sized pack makes up a vast majority of the configurations. So, what we see is customers have a very high willingness to spend, and there is a lot of pricing power that these vehicles have and what we have built as a brand has. And that gives us a lot of confidence as we go into the next 6 months, 12 months understanding the inflationary environment that we are in, that there is significant pricing capability on these vehicles. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the questions. The company is working on several new vehicle technologies. You spoke about LFP batteries, the Enduro motor, also the new network architecture and you commented on how it’s an important part of your long-term profitability objectives. Can you elaborate a bit more on how the development is going for some of these key technologies and do you expect them to still happen on time? Sure. As I mentioned before, Mark, we have – on our LFP pack, it first goes into our commercial vans later this year. Along with that, the Enduro motor’s first application is in the vans as well later this year. Both of those are well underway. In the case of the Enduro drive unit, we are putting that plant and that line in as we speak. So, there is the lines being built, the plants being – the additions going into our facility, and it is on track. We are pushing very hard. We are very excited to get that into our vehicles late this year. And then following introduction in the commercial van, both the LFP pack as well as our Enduro drive unit, as I said, with Enduro being used in a dual-motor setup, one in the front, one in the back, it also makes its way into the R1 product line. That’s helpful. For my second question, wanting to better understand the opportunity in software and services, and it’s an important part of your long-term opportunity. And I think a really interesting business opportunity for the industry. Can you speak more on how that’s progressing with some of the early R1 owners? And what kind of adoption you have seen on some of your offerings such as your insurance product? Thank you. We have seen strong take rates, especially around our offering from a financing as well as insurance perspective. And those are, as we know, we have had some questions as well around level of vertical integration. Those are two great examples of opportunities where we have partnered with strong third-parties, in the case of Chase on the financing side and then nationwide on the insurance side that allows us to build a very robust data-driven insights into the business. And importantly, through some of these data-driven insights allows us to continue to evolve the relationship that we have with our customer. And beyond financing and insurance, are really excited to also offer a whole host of software-enabled services and the FleetOS solution that we have with Amazon, there is a great benchmark as we think about the capabilities that we are bringing to bear to help them manage that end-to-end fleet solution. And in the case of FleetOS, we are also able to ultimately leverage a number of the core digital commerce investments that we have made as a company from the commercial side of the house and use those to think about, right, our consumer experience as truly how do you manage a fleet of one. And so we are really leveraging that digital infrastructure and digital backbone within the business across both the consumer as well as the commercial side of the house. And as we have talked about in the past, the 65% long-term gross margin opportunity that our software and services side of the business delivers allows us to ultimately drive and increase margins rapidly over time as we think about the compounding effects that, that can deliver from our growing car part. And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Relative to the 17% to 21% vehicle price increases implemented on March 1, I am curious how much of the higher pricing was meant to offset higher – obviously, higher battery metals costs or higher general inflation beyond your control versus maybe higher other more company-specific costs such as product development expense, etcetera. And what has been the trend in cost, both within and outside your control since the time that you revised pricing just prior to the last earnings call. And you discussed flexibility in your spending plans, and I appreciate your plentiful cash position, too. But have there been any examples yet of reined in budget increases or anything like that? Sure. So, to address the first question, as we thought about the decision to increase prices, we both looked across the broader inflationary backdrop that we are seeing across our raw material costs and beyond raw material costs, just looking at how inflation was playing, whether that was the cost of freight that we are seeing across the broader market and industry backdrop as well as other increases that you are seeing more broadly from an inflationary perspective. In addition to looking at each of those factors, we also importantly benchmarked, right, the value proposition that we are bringing to market and the core capabilities that our vehicles represented to ensure we were truly bringing a compelling value proposition even at the higher prices that we were charging. And I think the momentum and acceleration of preorders that we have seen post that March 1st mark certainly emphasizes right that, that equation is certainly still intact. And it’s been amazing to see a lot of the network effects that we have seen were in markets where we have been delivering more vehicles. We have also continued to see an acceleration of preorders because truly, our customers are best salespeople out there in the market, giving their own test drives and in some cases, actually reaching out to our customer experience center to ask them for how best to address their own friend’s questions as they are educating and really empowering and educating others about what the Rivian brand is and importantly, what that driving experience feels like within the market. So, those are our key enablers for us. Importantly, we are also not standing still as we think about the priorities that we have in regard to our own cost attack initiatives as we think about our own cost of goods sold and both the commercial opportunities that we have as an organization as well as a number of the engineering developments that, again, will ultimately be reducing the overall BOM costs. And as RJ mentioned, create a lot of those foundational systems that will power R2, which is, as you know, is a more affordably priced midsized SUV that will be coming out as well. And we will also benefit for all of these horizontal technology investments that will be coming to market with over the next 2 years. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi RJ and Claire. And so you maintained the full year guide on production. So, it looks like to hit that, you probably had to double your production – double or triple your production run rate from here. And based on the fact that it looks like you will be adding a second shift midyear, does that imply that you are assuming all the supply constraints should get resolved by midyear, by June, as you add the second shift there? Yes. Our production lines are capable of producing at a significantly higher rate than what our supply chain is able to support today, as you said. But the guidance we provided fully encapsulates our expectations and confidence around the supply chain. I said this in the last call, and I want to make sure I say it again here, we are pushing our suppliers as hard as possible to do more than that. We would really like to unlock the full production capability of our plant such that we can get more cars and more – or I should say, more vehicles to our customers given the significant demand backlog and given the excitement we have on both the consumer and the commercial side. Thanks. And on the Amazon EDVs, I guess on the consumer side, you are able to adjust pricing based on the cost inflation there. Do you have the flexibility on the EDVs as well in terms of some flexibility with respect to commercial EV pricing, etcetera? That’s it. Thanks. Sure. So, as you think about the Amazon contract, it’s a cost-plus agreement. And so that embeds, right, some of those overall inflationary metrics embedded in within that contract. It’s also important to note that as we think about the introduction of our LFP pack as well as the introduction of our Enduro motors in the commercial van, those are key enablers for significant cost-down opportunities for Amazon. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in regard to the ongoing margins that we can earn from that contract. And it’s important to note that, as Claire said, while it’s a cost-plus contract, we do also have it structured such that we keep a portion of all the savings that we accomplished with things like our LFP pack as well as the Enduro drive unit. Okay. Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. RJ Scaringe for closing remarks. Alright. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Enjoyed the discussion here, and I appreciate the questions from everyone that came in. Just in ending, I want to repeat a few things that came out through the course of the discussion. We couldn’t be more confident in the path that lies ahead. And we, as a leadership team, are very focused on making sure we take the $17 billion in cash that we have, the 150,000 units of installed capacity and the incredible demand we have from consumers, both on the – our customers, both on the consumer side as well as with our partner, Amazon, and taking all those core elements and ensuring we are positioning ourselves for significant growth over the coming years, but also focusing our capital deployment on ensuring that we launch R2 in 2025 and can do that with the cash that we have on hand. So, as Claire said and as I said so that we are in the driver’s seat in terms of our future growth. With that, we look forward to future discussions here and reporting continued progress as we work towards those goals. Thank you again, everyone, for joining. And this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Rivian’s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today’s call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today’s shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity, industry trends, business operations, strategy and goals, our second domestic manufacturing facility, our future products, including R2 and our expectations regarding vehicle deliveries. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business which are described in our SEC filings and today’s shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today’s shareholder letter.
With that, I will turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we will cover on today’s call.
The Rivian team delivered strong second quarter results despite the challenging supply chain environment. We produced and delivered over 4,400 vehicles across the R1T, R1S, and EDV 700. We have also recently started production validation builds of our EDV 500, which is a narrower and shorter version of the EDV and well-positioned for markets and applications where smaller form factors are needed. Our key focus remains ramping our normal facility to its full 150,000 units of installed capacity. While we continue to manage supply chain constraints, we are encouraged by the progress we are making, which is important for us to be able to add a second shift for general assembly towards the end of this quarter.
Equally as important is the continued strong demand for our products. As of June 30, we had about 98,000 net preorders and reservations for our R1 vehicles. Our daily preorder rate accelerated in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and as a reminder, these orders are for the United States and Canada only and are net of deliveries and cancellations. In June, we hosted a media venture showcasing the capabilities of our R1S in both on and off-road settings. It has been great to see the feedback from various media sources and customers as more of our R1S vehicles get out on the road.
Regarding our commercial business, in July, we hosted an event in partnership with Amazon to announce the formal rollout of EDVs to locations across the country. Since early 2021, we have been operating pilot deployments to capture direct feedback from drivers. This partnership was critical to the refinement of the EDV products over the last 18 months. In addition to the set of unique features of the van, we developed a comprehensive fleet management system, which we call FleetOS that provides end-to-end centralized fleet management, including vehicle distribution, service, telematics, charging, connectivity management and life cycle management.
As previously discussed, every vehicle delivered to Amazon comes with a FleetOS subscription, which represents a monthly recurring revenue stream for us. We are now ramping the build-out of our DC fast charging network, the Rivian Adventure Network. We believe it is critical for our brand to ensure our customers have a seamless charging experience that enables freedom to go anywhere without concern around charging access. In June, we launched our first locations using our DC chargers, which we manufacture in Normal, Illinois. These chargers have been developed from a clean sheet to operate at up to 900 volts, which is important for our future product road map. With a number of key sites underway, we are working to rapidly expand our network among popular routes, targeted destination areas and major highways initially across the U.S. and Canada. We believe this will be an important point of differentiation for us.
We have also started preproduction of validation units for our single-motor Enduro Drive unit. Two of these Enduro Drive units will be used in a dual-motor configuration in the R1 platform and a single Enduro Drive unit will be used for the commercial vans. This is the first of a family of drive units we are developing that will deliver greater efficiency and performance while creating meaningful cost savings. I’m very excited for the dual-motor R1. Having spent a lot of time driving this, I can say as a base configuration with over 600 horsepower, it’s a very exciting package.
I also want to comment on the Inflation Reduction Act. This just recently passed the Senate and is likely to be signed into law over the next week. We’re incredibly happy to see policy that helps drive more rapid adoption of electric vehicles as well as the important investments in building domestic battery cell production. For the world to quickly shift towards a carbon-free economy, this type of legislation creates the needed tailwinds for both consumers and industry.
The commercial segment, in particular, will benefit from the strong incentives for fleet operators to electrify and our RCV platform has been developed for a wide range of applications. While many of our R1 configurations won’t meet the bill’s pricing requirements, our R2 product line and associated cell road map are being developed to allow our customers to capture the value of these incentives. We have plenty of work ahead of us, but I couldn’t be more excited about the work our teams are doing for the ramp of the R1 EDV vehicles as well as the products, services and technologies we have in the pipeline. I wanted to thank our dedicated team members, suppliers and importantly, our customers and communities, for the tremendous support you continue to show us.
With that, I will pass the call over to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I want to echo your excitement around the second quarter results and the progress the team is making. During the second quarter, we produced and delivered over 4,400 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $364 million of revenue we generated. During the quarter, we recorded negative gross profit of $704 million. Simultaneously launching two vehicle platforms and production lines is a complex process with high fixed costs associated with the labor and overhead required to run our large-scale plant, which can support 150,000 units of annual capacity.
Our gross profit for the quarter was also impacted by the inflation of our materials as well as supply chain challenges, which caused the need for expedited shipping. In addition, we recorded a $301 million accounting adjustment in the second quarter related to LCNRV. As discussed on prior calls, the LCNRV adjustment writes down the value of certain inventory to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale.
On the research and development side, our team continues to pursue ongoing cost-down efforts associated with the R1 and RCV platforms as well as the development of our next-generation vehicle technologies, which we expect to leverage across our current and future vehicle platforms. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was negative $1.3 billion. Given the economic outlook, we remain focused on optimizing our product road map and associated operating expenses and capital expenditures. We ended the second quarter with over $15 billion of cash and remain confident in our path to launch the R2 vehicle platform with our cash on hand.
Now turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our 2022 guidance of 25,000 units of production. The supply chain continues to be the limiting factor in our production rates but we remain confident in our ability to achieve our target. On the delivery side, in July, we started a larger effort to move from truck to rail for our outbound freight, which should provide additional cost savings as we scale our operations. This transition will cause a larger discrepancy between production and deliveries in the coming quarters as we ramp production.
As a result of the impacts from the ramp of our Normal factory, recent cost pressures associated with the inflation of our materials, the associated LCNRV adjustments and expedited freight expenses, we are lowering our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to negative $5.45 billion. Importantly, we are lowering our annual capital expenditure guidance from $2.6 billion to $2 billion, primarily due to our more focused product road map. In aggregate, we expect our ending cash position for 2022 to be in line with our initial expectations.
In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA target and approximately 10% free cash flow target.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Hi, everybody. I’d like to just ask two questions. One is for Claire. A lot has obviously happened financially over the past year or so with inflation and supply chain issues. But could you maybe take a minute and maybe just take a step back and talk to us about the bridge to achieving positive gross margin from where we are at right now? We know that it consists of pricing and cost and volume, but if you could give us some thoughts on the components of that and the timing? And then secondly, RJ, I was hoping you can maybe elaborate a little bit on the longer term implications of the Inflation Reduction Act for the competitive landscape and for Rivian specifically and whether you see a path to achieving the material sourcing requirements that are in there and the value requirements and a little bit more on the commercial side, which sounds like it could be really meaningful up to, I think, $40,000 on certain gross vehicle weight vehicles. Does that sort of change the outlook for Rivian? Thanks, Ron. This is Claire speaking. And I wanted to hit on your first question in terms of what that path to positive gross profit and positive unit economics looks like for Rivian in particular. As you called out, right, we have seen unprecedented levels of inflation, especially across our raw material inputs and lithium prices that have gone up north of 115% over – since the start of this year, in particular, coupled with COVID and other factors that have driven a challenging supply chain and inflationary environment as well as part of that. But as we look out to the future, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have significant confidence in the long-term gross profit margin targets that we’ve set out for ourselves of approximately 25%. And I will give you a little bit of that path as we see from today going from our current state to that future state of positive unit economics. We see 2024 as really that pivotal year for us in driving a step change in terms of the underlying gross margin expectations within the business, as we have a couple of significant factors that are starting to impact our underlying unit economics. First and foremost, it’s really driven by us ramping our plants and our productivity within our 150,000 units of installed capacity within Normal that allows us to really leverage all of those fixed overhead and costs associated with our large-scale production facility.
Second, it’s also our ability to introduce our next-generation technologies into our vehicles, first in our R1 products as well as in our EDVs. So those are things like in-sourcing of our motors, the introduction of our LFP pack, which will be introduced first in our commercial vehicles, that allow us to really drive a step change in terms of vehicle performance in that time frame, which enables us to increase pricing on the vehicles, given the fact we will have vehicles with added range and added performance and capabilities, but they also importantly drive significant cost-downs within our bill of materials as we look at that roadmap ahead. And then finally, the other core factor as we think about that touchstone from a gross profit perspective is also really the anniversarying or moving beyond those pre-March 1 pre-orders as well that allow us to move into our current ASPs. And as we reiterated our last earnings call, we have seen $93,000 plus ASPs with the preorders that we have had post pricing change. Thanks, Claire. And Rod I appreciate the question. I think with regards to the Inflation Reduction Act, this is, as I commented earlier, this is a really important step and I think it’s great for the acceleration of electrification and really providing a path to a carbon-neutral economy. Now in terms of what that represents for us, it’s certainly a powerful tailwind. As you commented, in the commercial space at the higher GVW class, this would be in the realm of what we call our EDV 900, which is the largest version of our RCV platform, so GVW, gross vehicle weight, above 14,000 pounds. The incentives are quite strong, the consumer-facing incentives at over – at $40,000. So the – we see this as really helping to drive a rapid transition to electric vehicles in the commercial space. And then in a similar way on the consumer side, certainly creating tailwinds around localization of the supply chain, in particular with battery cells. And we’ve designed not just the product but also the way we think about our supply chain and our battery cell strategy to really be consistent with the intent of what we have seen in the Inflation Reduction Act. So I think this is great news for electrification. It’s certainly something we are very excited about and it’s going to have long-range implications for the whole industry. Great. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open. Good afternoon and good evening guys. Maybe just to follow up on Rod’s question here. I mean, the mix seems like it may ultimately be much stronger than you are expecting. And I think one of the interesting comments from one of the reviewers in your shareholder letter, RJ, was that they compared the R1s to the Range Rover, Mercedes Galanda Wagon and the Urus. So, I am just curious, as you think about the retail side if there is an opportunity to keep mix incredibly strong and push maybe to the higher end of the range and then also grow the commercial vehicle side of the business kind of to those credits that Rod just going over with you and that sort of the mix maybe just far superior to anything you were expecting mix and pricing in the past and that’s really what helped offset to offset the inflation and maybe you hit your margin targets or maybe something better. I mean, how do you think about these early days of the reviews and what you’re actually getting on a mix from a retail and commercial side? Yes. Thanks, John. We’ve certainly – we talked about this in the last call. We’ve certainly been really pleased with the reaction to the product and how excited consumers are. And with that, we do believe there is a lot of pricing power embedded in the vehicles and embedded in what we’re creating as a brand. And with that, the demand that we continue to see growing and accelerating really speaks to that. So for us, looking on the consumer side, we’re certainly thinking about it in the context of some of our future packages and some of the configurations that we will offer over time. But it is stronger than what we expected, and it does certainly offset some of the increased costs we’re seeing. With regards to commercial, in a very similar way, we see the demand for commercial electrification being very strong across all different segments, not just last-mile. And the platform we have with RCV, Rivian Commercial Van, is really set up well for that. Of course, we’re initially focusing on the delivery space. But across cargo, across work van, there is a whole host of applications where we see very strong demand. And that’s, of course, going to be amplified by the Inflation Reduction Act. Okay. And then if I can ask a quick follow-up. That’s helpful, RJ. On the EBITDA guide, I mean, Claire, it looks like there is a pretty meaningful deterioration through the second half versus the first half. I mean, volume is ramping up, you get some of these fixed costs covered. I mean, is it just simply cost inflation that’s eroding the second half versus the first half? Or what’s the key driver there? Sure. The key drivers that we’ve experienced are both our expectation that there’ll be higher anticipated cost of goods sold, and that’s partially offset by lower operating expenses within the business. And I’ll unpack a little bit of the higher COGS outlook, which includes both the fact that we’ve seen higher startup costs or inefficiencies associated with ramping four vehicles across two production lines at our plant in Normal. We’ve also seen higher levels of inflation, especially around raw material inflation. And some of those while we’ve seen spike in terms of where the spot market is for some of those inflationary raw material factors. Some of those are also second half impacts that we will experience, just given the contracts that we have with some of our suppliers. And then beyond that, we’ve also experienced increased costs in regard to our expedited freight expenses, which are really the result of the challenging supply chain environment that we’ve been navigating as well.
And then one last point on it is also the fact that we do expect to also incur higher levels of LCNRV over the course of the remainder of the year, which are really the results of many of these increases across our startup costs as well as inflation. So for example, every additional dollar of inflation also impacts the LCNRV adjustment that we make on our inventory and firm commitments at the end of each quarter. And so it really has an amplifying or multiplying effect, given the factors that I walked through that have driven some of this headwind from a cost of goods sold perspective as we look out over the course of the second half of the year. But I do want to just reiterate the fact that we do still expect that our year-ending cash balance will be unchanged relative to your initial expectations, given the fact we’ve also reduced our CapEx guidance due to our focused product road map and the push-out of certain CapEx spend to 2023. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much, guys. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I was hoping, first, you could talk a little bit more on the supply chain issues that you’re seeing. What are some of the biggest constraints currently? And as you speak to adding a third shift – or excuse me, a second shift later in the third quarter, what needs to happen in order to enable that pickup in production? Thanks, Mark. We’ve certainly seen a – some of the supply chain challenges we’ve talked about in previous calls start to really shift. And this was embedded into our overall projections and our guidance and confidence around our guidance for 25,000 vehicles for the year. The second quarter saw a number of challenges in terms of the semiconductor space as well as just overall ramping of the volume within our supply base. But we’ve – as we look out for the remainder of the year through Q3 and Q4, we have a lot of confidence that both the suppliers are really leaning in with us, but also we see the demonstrated performance to be able to hit the continued ramp. And this is what’s enabling us to plan for the second shift to come online here later this quarter. That’s helpful. And my second question is the company announced some targeted cost reductions recently. How much cost do you expect that to save when fully implemented? And when do you think you’ll be at that full run rate of savings? Thanks. From a cost perspective, ultimately, as I mentioned, as I walked through some of the levers of the adjustments to our underlying EBITDA guidance, we do expect there to be an underlying OpEx savings throughout the course of this year, given the reductions in force that we had made. Most of the payroll savings, we don’t expect to really take full effect until 2023. But it’s also important to note that as we think about our road map forward, we’re also investing in a lot of the key areas of growth within the business. So we really try to allocate that resource and investment in those critical next-generation technologies and the build-out of our customer service and customer support efforts from a transaction perspective as well. So in aggregate, you’ll see more of a flattening of our operating expenses that we will start with a reduction in Q4 and then build up throughout the course of 2023. That’s the changes that we’ve made and the optimization from an operating expense perspective allows us to continue to invest in these critical areas of the business. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Joe Spak from RBC Capital. Thanks so much, everyone. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on the second shift that you expect to sort of come on here at the end of this quarter, right. It’s not another line, it’s a shift. So if you have that first shift running at rate, how much more rate does that second shift give you? I imagine it wouldn’t be 2x, but some framing would be helpful? Thanks, Joe. Bringing on a second shift is – it involves both making sure the supply chain is capable of supporting it, as we talked about before. It wouldn’t make any sense for us to have to hire a whole second shift and then have the line still waiting for parts. So first and foremost, we’ve been very much emphasizing supplier readiness to support this and have worked very closely to look at any parts that we think are constrained or may be constrained. But with that, the other big element is, of course, making sure the organization’s ready for that. And this really ties to the shop floor leadership, so making sure our team leaders, our group leader’s prepared. We’ve got the training programs in place. In fact, we had a great leadership offsite. We had all the group leaders from across the plant a couple of weeks ago, and really getting the whole organization ready to go to a second shift and making sure we have leaders that have experience running in the first shift, as you said, on a line that’s fairly stable such that we bring on the second shift that we get as much output out of the second shift as possible. Now it’s not a binary step. There is a process of ramping the second shift, much like we have with the first shift. But in terms of equipment readiness, robotics and automation controls, those items, of course, have already been worked out through the running of the first shift, so we expect the bring-on and ramp up of the second shift to be much very rapid. And we’ve begun hiring for that, so the hiring has been underway, and it’s working – we’re working towards bringing that second shift, as I said before, online by the end of this quarter. Okay. I guess the second question is related to FleetOS, which you detailed in the shareholder letter somewhat. Is that exclusively what Amazon is using? Or are they using a layer of their own software on top of what you provide them? And then since you indicated that there is an element of recurring revenue here, is it possible to sort of break out how many EDVs were in the quarter? And I know there has been some numbers reported in the press as sort of what you expected for the year, but maybe you could sort of just clear that up on what you think you could deliver to Amazon for the year? One of the things that’s really exciting about the EDV program is on the surface, you look at and we see the van, this large, very friendly-looking commercial van. But it – what you’re not necessarily seeing is the amount of work and effort that went into really deeply integrating the vehicle into Amazon’s ecosystem. And so when you get into the vehicle, what you see on the screen, the way it integrates within the routing platform, took a lot of post partnership and collaboration, and a lot of feedback and iteration working with drivers. Now above and beyond that, of course, FleetOS is a platform we use to effectively utilize and manage the fleet. So that’s looking at prognostics around maintenance and service, of course, looking at the data around how the vehicles are being used, where we can predictively assess issues that may come up, fleet management in terms of how do we think about aging of the vehicles. And then, of course, some of the bigger items that really affect day in, day out operations like charging. So this is something that we developed with the benefit of a lot of iteration and this iteration with Amazon, but also with a lot of visibility to exactly how an electric fleet at scale is going to be used and the benefits that can be derived from centralized deterministic decision-making around how efficiently and effectively the fleet you deployed. Okay. And any chance of the number of EDVs? Yes. We haven’t announced the specific number of EDVs that are being built. I would say, as we’ve talked about, you referenced it publicly. We’re really excited to start seeing a lot more of these on the road. We had a launch event several weeks ago in partnership with Amazon. And the thing that is perhaps the most motivating to us is just getting a chance to meet with drivers and seeing how excited they are to be in the vehicles. And all the little details that we worked through and thought about, whether it’s the powered bulkhead door, the step height, the grab handles, even the software features I talked about before, our cooled seats, each of those features lights up a driver’s day and makes the – makes their office, so to speak, a more enjoyable and better place to be in. So we are very, very motivated to deliver as many as possible. And certainly, Amazon is pushing for that as well. This is a key part of their climate pledge. And we will start seeing a lot more of these on the road very soon. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Coldicott from Redburn. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one on production, I wondered if you would be willing to comment on the weekly production rate that you exited Q2 with and give us an idea of where it is today or at least maybe also some sort of idea about how we should think about Q3 versus Q4 for the remainder of your production guidance? Sure, Charles. And one of the interesting things if one tries to average our output over the second quarter, it’s, in some ways, misleading because it hides the signal, so to speak, in the sense that there was a lot of second quarter where we weren’t able to fully utilize our line. We weren’t able to even run a full single shift because of component supply. And so as you look at the exit rate or I think even more importantly, the unconstrained production rate where we had components – component supply to support full utilization of the lines, it was considerably higher than what the average was over the course of the quarter. And knowing the state of the supply chain and knowing the – and having the confidence around component supply throughout quarter three and into quarter four allows us to have confidence in an expansion in the level of volume we’re going to be delivering this quarter and then certainly into Q4 as we move to fully utilizing two shifts. So ultimately, again, we continue to have confidence in our guidance for the year. And that’s borne out of the demonstrated performance in terms of line operations through quarter two and through the deep relationships and confidence we have with our suppliers. Okay, thank you. And then just on the order intake, so it seems like it accelerated at the end of Q2. Can you talk a bit about maybe why you think that was? Perhaps share some detail on particular vehicle trims that were most popular. For sure. We’ve been able to spend a good deal of time interacting with customers, and one of the things that we continue to hear back from customers is how often they get asked about their vehicle. And if you take a trip to the beach or if you’re in a shopping plaza, people are naturally drawn to the vehicle and ask lots of questions and are excited to see it. And that’s creating ever greater awareness. So the more vehicles that are on the road, the more people are learning about them, hearing about them. And we certainly think that’s leading to some of the accelerated demand that we’re now witnessing. But as was referenced earlier on the call, we’re also continuing to see very positive reviews. So journalists, influencers having a chance to get exposure to the vehicle are seeing that this is such a unique combination of extremely high on-road performance, incredibly capable off-road performance, really nice everyday usability within a package that, from a technology point of view and a connectivity point of view, is wonderfully fun to use. So, that’s creating echoes, I think with – throughout the customer base where people are sharing about the vehicle and getting very excited about it. Now, with that said, and Claire mentioned this, we also see strong preference for some of our highest trims, so both in terms of the content on the interior of the vehicle but also our drivetrain configurations. And so, the high trims are the more expensive trims is very high, in fact, higher than we had expected as well. And it’s, in many ways, capturing the really strong pricing power that the vehicles and the brand represent. And what gives us a lot of confidence, as we talked about before, around our margin structure long-term. Great. Thanks guys. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from George Gianarikas from Canaccord. Your line is now open. Hey everyone. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. I would love to hear about what the cars that you have on the road, what kind of data they are sharing with you so far, how the data that you have collected can inform future product design or what it’s telling you about your product performance to-date? Thanks. Thanks George. One of the really exciting things that – probably, one of the things I think our team enjoys the most is to see how all of our vehicles get used and to hear the stories from customers and to see the everyday use cases and the extreme use cases. So, I get e-mails and notes all the time with pictures of the vehicles at the top of mountains or driving through off-road trails. And then we also see them stuffed full of kids and gear on their way to Disney World. So, it is really – it’s rewarding for not just myself, but for the full team to see people really using our vehicles as we intended, to both enable, but also inspire people to go do the kinds of things they want to take photographs of. And so that really is that going through the organization as we now think about R2 and some of the features that go into it and how do we make sure we continue to capture the essence of the brand that – the desire to or the brand essence of just driving the desire to go explore and to see new things. Now, in terms of the specific data coming off the vehicles, of course, we are using the data off of our self-driving platform to continue to improve and refine features. And we are seeing that every couple of weeks with our over-the-air updates that provide enhancements on everything from self-driving to new drive modes to – we just recently added a pet mode. Soon, we are going to be adding a camp mode. It’s a very exciting mode. So, the feedback loop as well as how we are realizing the vehicles are going to be used informs a lot of the digital feature set that we continually add to the vehicle over time. I would like to ask just one follow-up on that. Reportedly, VW’s CEO lost his job because the company wasn’t pivoting quickly enough to developing its own internal software. How successful are you guys in continuing to hire the right software talent? And if you could just remind us, how much third-party software do you use throughout your vehicle? And how much have you developed on your own? Thank you. So, our vehicle architecture was really designed, at its core, as being really a software-focused or software-first platform. So, the compute platforms of the ECUs across the vehicle, the network architecture, these are developed in-house. So, those are everything from the experience module to the autonomous control module to the vehicle dynamics module. These compute platforms developed in-house and, of course, the software stack that sit on top of those are developed in-house. And we deeply believe that control of not just the electronics, but also the software that runs across all those platforms is incredibly important in terms of creating differentiated customer experiences and experiences that are enhanced over time. And when I say enhanced over time, I am not measuring time in months or years, but measuring time in weeks. So, the vehicle gets better week-over-week, month-after-month. And it’s one of the things we are finding with our early customers that they really love. They have feedback on something, we can address it. If there is an idea for a feature, we can create it. And so from the very early days of forming Rivian, it was, we always had a very heavy focus on knowing the vertical integration and control of our electronics and software stack was going to be critical for creating these highly differentiated customer experiences. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Alexander Potter from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks guys. A couple of questions on RCVs and FleetOS. So first one, you mentioned there is a lot of demand for vans, these types of applications, cargo outside of e-commerce and last-mile delivery. But I am also interested the extent to which you actually have the bandwidth to entertain inbound questions or inquiries from big fleets that are outside those initial markets that you are focusing on. Do you have the ability to start talking through, I don’t know if it’s telco or some of these other commercial van seats, how you would integrate as closely as you have with Amazon? I mean it’s not something you do overnight. So, yes, I guess that’s the first question. Alex, it’s a great question. And as you noted, for these very large fleets, the sales cycle, so to speak, takes a long time. So, building the relationships, understanding the needs of the fleet, determining what adjustments to the vehicle or specific attributes of the vehicle need to be sort of thought about in the context of how they are used within these larger fleets, it just simply takes time. And so while the production – while production lines are ramping and we are delivering as many vehicles as we can to Amazon, we have started those long – sort of long-cycle discussions with some of the very large fleets. And they are certainly making sure that as these larger fleets beyond the last mile as well, as they start to plan their path to being fully electrified, that we are supporting that planning, but also, of course, embedding ourselves into that planning. And as I have said, I think the Inflation Reduction Act certainly creates a very large amplification of the demand here and certainly a very strong tailwind for us as we have those discussions. Okay. Yes. Then Inflation Reduction Act, you mentioned that, so that reminded me of the other question I wanted to ask. How feasible is it? You get a lot of people saying that it’s well intentioned and everybody is sort of onboard with the objective. But it can take whatever, 7 years, 10 years to get production, refining, mining permitted in the U.S. So, do we need to break bottlenecks on the, I guess or cut red tape in order for this bill to actually end up having any impact? Thanks. Yes. In terms of battery – domestic battery production, you are right, these are – some of these items do take time, whether it’s a cell plant or material processing, let’s say, lithium hydroxide processing facility. It’s important to note that in the commercial space, the requirements for localization are not as aggressive as they are in the consumer space. So, that’s an important distinction for us that the full localization of that supply chain is not – does not have the same tight requirements that we are seeing – that we have in the consumer vehicles. Now, in the consumer vehicle side for R2, this is something that we have been working on for a while and have talked about previously, but really designing a supply chain that is addressing some of the geopolitical risks above and beyond what’s now sort of being driven by the Inflation Reduction Act. But that’s been something that’s been work underway for quite some time. And as we have contemplated and planned for the long-term supply chain for R2, we have always looked at it through the lens of making sure we had domestic supply chain to support the ramp-up of that product. Very good. Thanks guys. And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. First question is on the EDVs and deliveries to Amazon. I think in the past, you have highlighted at least some full year target around the split in the 25,000 units between R1s and EDVs. Can you just remind us what that is and whether you are tracking in line with those targets so far? And then related to sort of like this Amazon business, can you also remind us of either the pricing or economics of the FleetOS? Sure. Emmanuel, as RJ mentioned, we are working hard to build as many EDVs as possible this year. One quick callout is also the seasonality impacts that we have with Amazon. Q4 is really Amazon peak holiday period. And so for us, we are really trying to charge ahead and build as many as we can through the fall to get as many of those vehicles out on the road to service those customers throughout that peak holiday period over the next handful of months overall. We are not providing a specific target at this time in terms of the overall penetration of EDVs that we expect to produce this year. But as RJ mentioned, we are working through some of the supply chain bottlenecks as we speak to make sure that we are continuously ramping our production output of the EDVs. And we have seen really significant progress on the line, so our lines are capable of producing or in excess of the underlying weekly output from a production perspective that we have seen to-date. And as we have talked about in the past, we are not providing specifics around the FleetOS pricing that we are providing for Amazon. But we specifically see this as a significant long-term margin accretive piece of our business as we think about the broader service opportunity that Rivian can address. And FleetOS is really that first example of that long-term opportunity, and it’s a proposition that we can offer to many other fleet customers as well. I think that’s one of the key advantages is just the flexibility that the platform entails for both Amazon, but also importantly, for other potential commercial fleet managers as well that we can address with it. Thank you. And then my second question is on the CapEx outlook. So, you have cut this year’s planned spending from $2.6 billion to $2 billion. Can you talk about the implications for the outlook beyond this year? I think that as part of last quarter’s update, I think this was generally lower to low $2 billion or so per year through mid-decade. Do you have to catch up on some of the delayed spending from this year into next year? Is $2 billion the new run rate on a go-forward basis? How should we think about that? Sure. So, as we think about the CapEx roadmap for the coming years, we still expect to be spending in that low $2 billion area through 2025, which allows us to continue to invest in the expansion of our plant in Normal, Illinois, where right now we are adding our in-sourced motor production lines. It also entails us the opportunity to invest in the first 200,000 units of capacity for R2 in Georgia. And so the timing – some of the timing changes definitely do fluctuate 1 year to the next. But in total, our expectation remains unchanged around continuing to spend in that low $2 billion area from a CapEx perspective. And that’s really been driven by the focused product roadmap that we have set out and we have talked about throughout the course of the last quarter as well. Okay. Thank you. And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I realize your vehicles have not been on the road all that long, but I am curious how many miles you estimate your customers may have driven thus far. I think you may have good data around that, and how warranty and service claims might be tracking relative to your initial expectations, either in terms of frequency or severity or expense for that given mileage amount? And then when the vehicles are subject to service or repair, are they more coming into your service centers? And maybe remind us how many you are up to now. I think over 20, or are you more frequently sending mechanics out to your customers’ homes? And how has the customer experience been tracking to-date in either case? Yes. Ryan, great point to your question. Just to sort of start with the service question. We have 24 brick-and-mortar service locations today and these handle the larger service activities. They also handle pre-delivery inspection for us. But as you indicated in your question, a lot of our service is actually done through our mobile fleet. So, we have a fleet of vans and Rivian R1Ts that go to a customer’s home or go to a customer’s place of business and can service the vehicle there. And that will – over time, that’s going to make up the vast majority of our service events. Today, it’s on the order of about 50%, but growing very quickly. With that said, there are a lot of miles driven and a lot of miles driven on different terrains. We haven’t published a number on total number of miles driven. And with regards to warrant for your service, we also haven’t provided guidance on warranty or service numbers. But what we can say certainly that it’s been great to see the vehicles being used across so many different environments and seeing what we have really enjoyed is seeing people take very long road trips. We have had lots of trips going across the country. We have – we actually have some – just got some notes, some vehicles that drove from California up to Alaska. So, there is a lot of really long trips, a lot of really strenuous trips that are being taken into vehicles, which is fun to see. Very helpful. Thank you. And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe for closing remarks. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We are really excited about the path ahead. The continued ramp of the R1 product line and, of course, the EDVs from our Normal facility as well as the technologies that Claire and I both spoke to today that we are developing across our propulsion platform, our network architecture, our self-driving and, of course, software and our full software stack. So, looking forward to seeing a lot more of our vehicles on the road and thank you again for the time. Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Tim Bei. You may begin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today's call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity, industry trends, business operations, strategy and goals, our production ramp and manufacturing capacity expansion, our proposed joint venture with Mercedes Benz, our future products and product enhancements, including R2, and our expectations regarding vehicle deliveries.
Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, which are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
Having just passed the 1-year anniversary of the start of production for the R1T, I want to take this opportunity to highlight the progress our team has made this past year. We launched 4 variants across our consumer and commercial vehicle platforms. We are awarded MotorTrend's Truck of the Year, along with other media accolades. We produced more than 15,000 vehicles as of September 30, and we continue to ramp our production to fully utilize our normal facility.
In addition, we also launched our go-to-market operations and services, which include our physical service centers and mobile service vehicles, delivery operations, FleetOS, financing, insurance, remarketing and the Rivian Adventure Network, our in-house developed and produced network of DC fast chargers. It's been rewarding to see the excitement and enthusiasm for our first generation of products.
We believe we're in a unique position during a transformational time for the auto industry. Production of our designed and developed products continues to ramp at our large-scale vertically integrated production facility in Normal. We have significant demand visibility as evidenced by our consumer and commercial backlog.
We have a strong balance sheet with $14 billion of cash that offers us the flexibility to navigate these uncertain economic times and look for capital-efficient methods to drive growth. We remain focused on ramping production in a cost-efficient manner, and we've seen improvement across our cost of goods sold, operating expenses and capital expenditures over the past quarter.
The third quarter was another record for the Rivian team. We produced over 7, 300 vehicles across the R1T, R1S, and EDV product lines. Our key focus remains ramping our normal facility to achieve the targeted annual capacity. As part of this progress, we reached a key milestone recently as our second manufacturing shift started producing vehicles. It takes extraordinary coordination to ramp a highly vertically integrated facility of this size, and I'm grateful for all the hard work that's gone into it.
We continue to see strong demand for our products. As of November 7, we had over 114,000 net preorders and reservations for our R1 vehicles. As a reminder, these orders are from the United States and Canada only and are net of deliveries and cancellations. The third quarter was also important for our commercial business. In early September, we announced the signing of an MOU with Mercedes-Benz for a strategic partnership for commercial electric vans in Europe, the world's largest van market.
We continue to deliver EDVs to Amazon and expand our FleetOS offering. Amazon has delivered over 5 million packages with the EDVs and is now making deliveries in over 100 cities. Every two weeks, I spend a few days driving the EDV as my daily driver. It's a great way for me to personally experience what the drivers of these vans actually experience, everything from the seating position to the unique pocket door to the overall vehicle dynamics, it's a really exciting package.
And at stoplights or parking lots, the enthusiasm I get to see firsthand from folks that are seeing it for the first time or asking questions about it, it's really exciting and we're happy to be to help raise the bar for electrifying logistics.
As we continue to look for opportunities to scale our platforms, production and technologies in capital-efficient ways, we're strategically investing in our in-house technologies, which will enable differentiated product performance and capabilities while also delivering structural cost advantages. Our in-house software capabilities allow us to be agile and provide customers with an improved experience.
On the hardware side, we're excited to ramp production of our fully in-house drive unit. The Enduro production lines are coming to life now. It's great to see not only the vertically-integrated motor but also the design of our manufacturing lines. In early 2023, we plan to introduce the Enduro motor and our first LFP battery pack into the commercial van line in Normal. These changes will enable optimized performance at a significantly lower cost.
It's imperative that we get the introduction of these new technologies right so we've allocated meaningful time to quality loops and process checks in the first quarter. We are excited about the progress our teams are making across future vehicles and technologies as well as improving the performance and cost of our current offerings. While we haven't shown any of our future products yet, I couldn't be more excited about the work happening on our next platform. The smaller size of this platform is enabling some wonderfully unique products and we are looking forward to be able to show these to the world.
I want to thank our dedicated team members, suppliers and importantly, our customers and communities for the tremendous support you continue to show us.
With that, I'll pass the call over to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I want to echo your excitement around the third quarter results and the progress the team is making. During the third quarter, we produced over 7,300 vehicles and delivered nearly 6,600 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $536 million of revenue we generated. We recorded negative gross profit of $917 million in the third quarter. We continue to be impacted by the high fixed cost structure associated with running high-volume production lines at low volumes while we ramp.
We recorded a $696 million accounting adjustment in the third quarter related to LCNRV. As discussed on prior calls, the LCNRV adjustment writes down the value of certain inventory to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale. The increase in our LCNRV charge represents the vast majority of the increase in cost of goods sold as compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase in LCNRV compared to the second quarter is primarily due to an increase in overall inventory and firm purchase commitment values ahead of the start of our second manufacturing shift. In addition, similar to prior quarters, gross profit for the quarter was also impacted by the inflation of our raw materials as well as supply chain challenges, which caused the need for expedited shipping.
Operating expenses grew by an approximate $160 million as compared to the same quarter last year. The primary driver of this increase is stock-based compensation expense, which we did not recognize prior to our November 2021 IPO. When looking at our operating expense this past quarter versus the second quarter of 2022, we saw a nearly $150 million decrease.
Our Q3 operating expenses reflect our ongoing prioritization of investment in our core and vehicle technologies and customer experience while continuing to drive additional focus and cost optimization across the business. We continue to focus on deploying capital in the most efficient way and ensuring that every dollar spent helps us towards our long-term financial targets, which in turn helps accelerate the impact we can deliver.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was negative $1.3 billion, which is flat to the second quarter of 2022. We ended the third quarter with about $14 billion of cash on hand. We continue to monitor the economic environment and believe we have a high level of flexibility regarding the cadence of our growth investments. We remain confident in our ability to fund operations with cash on hand through 2025, excluding the impact of our investment in the contemplated joint venture with Mercedes-Benz.
We continue to work with the state of Georgia and the Joint Development Authority on our second domestic production facility. We are adjusting the timeline for launching the R2 platform and expect it will launch in 2026. We expect the R2 platform will unlock a massive global market expansion opportunity for Rivian and are excited about the development work that's underway.
We are also reaffirming our 2022 full year guidance of 25,000 total vehicles produced. The supply chain continues to be our largest source of uncertainty as we continue to ramp production. We've experienced five days of production downtime in October and November due to a lack of supply of a key component, which limited our quarter-to-date production.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect the in-transit time from rail shipments, coupled with an increase in volumes from the ramp of our second shift towards the end of the quarter, will cause a significant discrepancy between production and deliveries.
In addition, we're reaffirming our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $5.45 billion. We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to $1.75 billion due to our streamlined product road map and the shift of certain capital expenditures to 2023. As RJ mentioned, we have over 114,000 net R1 preorders as of November 7. As we ramp our production and deliveries, we believe preorders will become an increasingly less important measure of our fundamental progress as a business. Going forward, we no longer plan to provide an updated preorder number during our quarterly earnings calls.
In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for all the info. A couple of quick ones. That announcement that you're not going to provide on the preorders anymore. I am just curious what the motivation is for that. Are we getting to a point where the preorders are getting so robust or long that ebbs and flows in those relative to production might not actually be that informative? I mean, what's kind of the driving factor in that change in communication? Thanks, John. This is Claire. As it pertains to the preorders, our sentiment was more so that we're one year post our start of production as an organization. We're starting to really ramp up our production and the deliveries associated with our R1 platform, so don't feel like it's really a meaningful metric for us to continue to provide overall to the market.
Obviously, given the 114,000-unit backlog that we currently have, that extends us into 2024 as well, it's a robust backlog of demand that we have for our vehicles. And this is going to be consistent with what you'll see from us on a go-forward basis as it pertains to additional new product launches as well. Okay, that's helpful. And then RJ, on the Mercedes JV, I just wonder if you could give us an update there. I mean, I think a skeptic could say, hey, listen, you would have been able to enter and be successful in the European market ultimately on your own over time, just given your product. But an optimist might say, hey, listen, that opens up that market that much faster and provides more robust growth sooner. Just curious if you can kind of maybe couch the direction there on optimist versus skeptic and any other updates you might be able to give us there. Sure, John. Yes, Mercedes is, in terms of a partner and somewhat to be looking at how do we accelerate electrification faster, there's very much aligned mentality, aligned mentality around the need to electrify, aligned mentality on how we think about products and the position of products and the execution of products. So it's a relationship and a partnership that we're working towards that we think kind of on both sides to accomplish more together. Ultimately, as we think about this, as we look at this market, it is an important and large space for the commercial van space in Europe. And we felt Mercedes was a great partner to be looking at this with. Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in. The delta in deliveries versus production, Claire, will that continue to expand over time? Or are we kind of looking at sort of a onetime gap opening up here in the fourth quarter? Just trying to gauge the revenue recognition versus the production so we can think about that for our models go forward. The Q4 gap will be exacerbated here in particular because we have the second shift that that's coming online and really ramping from a production perspective that back-weights the volumes from a production perspective in the second half of the quarter. And then that, coupled obviously with the shift that we've had to rail and then the holiday period where customers are a little bit harder to find in that last week of December that will be a driver of that core shift for us.
Obviously, what we don't deliver in Q4 rolls into the upcoming quarter, so you start to normalize over time as we ramp closer to the installed capacity within the plant in Normal. So the gap should narrow on a percent basis on a go-forward basis. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much, guys. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, everybody. So my first question, Claire, is if I do the calculation quarter-on-quarter sequentially from 2Q to 3Q, your revenue increased $172 million, and your gross loss, if you will, improved by $182 million if you exclude LCNRV, okay, which is substantial -- more substantial this quarter than last quarter. So on my math, your improvement in gross profit ex LCNRV was actually greater than your change of revenue.
Now there may be some stuff going on sequentially and maybe there were some really unusual other knocks on gross profit last quarter, but I just wanted to kind of make sure my math is right and to see if there was what you could highlight sequentially that got a lot better underlying, excluding the LCNRV, to draw that improvement of gross profit that actually exceeded the change in revenue. Thanks. Thanks, Adam. So unpacking the question first about LCNRV itself, it's important to understand there are different components. So the way to your calculation, which is entirely excluding it, is not necessarily the way that I would direct you to look at it. The segment you may want to look at instead is really looking, in particular, at the change in increase in LCNRV versus the complete exclusion of it.
The way to think about it is LCNRV is really accelerating the recognition of losses as we take in raw materials and have our firm commitments, which we're then grossing up to say, what is the cost for us to turn these materials into that end-state vehicle themselves? And so as it pertains to the quarter, we get both the benefit of a reduction of bill of materials and conversion costs associated with sort of the baselining of inventory levels if inventory were held constant within those two quarters.
And so that's why we look to that increase as you look at that calculation in particular. And so if you're looking based off of your own metrics, there, right, it's more of an 11% increase in that cost of goods sold on a comparable basis versus a 47% increase in deliveries in aggregate. So we've made meaningful progress to sort of close the loop on that front, but I wanted to just direct you to some of those nuances. Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on reservations. Can you tell us where -- give us an update on where you're getting your customers from what they currently drive? And then same thing for your deliveries, just to kind of get a sense, how many are coming from Tesla or trucker SUV owners? Any other color there would be great? Thanks. Sure, Adam. One of the things we targeted in developing the products and thinking about R1T and R1S, these are really flagship products that introduce the brand, really open the brand umbrella for us to, over time, add additional products. And because of that, we wanted them to be pulling -- the target state, I should say, was to be pulling customers from a broad spectrum of vehicle formats and form factors as well as brands.
And sitting here today, we now have the actual so look at how we did relative to target state. And we're really pleased that we do have a really diverse set of customers. So certainly, customers are coming out of -- some customers coming out of Teslas. But really, there's no single brand that represents a significant percentage of our overall demand.
But I would want to add a couple of really important metrics, the first of which is the vast majority of our customers, close to 90%, do not currently own an EV, meaning most of our customers are new EV customers, which is really important from a mission point of view because it means the brand, the products we've created, it's helping -- we're helping to create new EV customers, who’re driving that transition. And the second is the number of customers that are buying an R1T that haven't owned a pickup before.
That's well over a majority of the customers haven't owned a pickup before, and they're being introduced to it through a very different type of pickup, of course, something that's very lifestyle-focused. And in a similar sense, the R1S is, in many cases, folks are moving into it as a prelaunch SUV is something they've aspired to but haven't been able to make that jump before, in many cases, because of desires around efficiency and what we can deliver in a full-size 3-row SUV with something that's great on-road and off-road. It's really pulling in a broad spectrum of customers. Thanks, RJ. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC. Your line is open. Thanks so much, everyone. Claire, I want to go back to Adam's question because I was sort of pulling on a similar thread here and I'm trying to sort of update real time for what you just said. So if I just look at auto COGS divided by deliveries in the second quarter, no adjustments, and then I do the same thing in the third quarter but adjust for the increase in the inventory adjustment, as you just suggested, it still seems like that COGS per unit, while still obviously above what you're selling the vehicle for, did improve like over 30%.
So can you just help us understand, like is that not right? Like is there something with the accounting that does not allow you to do that calculation? No, that's absolutely right. As I had mentioned, right, as you factor the sort of apples-to-apples comparison of the way that you're looking at it, Joe, you would see a 33%-plus improvement on a quarter sequential basis. Okay. Maybe I misheard that. I thought I heard 11%. Okay. And is that... Dollars is 11% growth of dollars, but that is off of -- right, the fact that we're also increasing 47% on a deliveries basis. So you're really netting the two of those. Okay. And so that's sort of the leverage you're seeing in the plant? Or is there anything with mix between R1s and the vans in the quarter that impacted that? The biggest driver that we've seen on a quarter sequential basis is just some of the cost efficiency that we're driving within the plant, us also moving beyond some of the start-up-related costs as well. That's a key enabler for us as we've seen and continue to moderate down that cost of goods sold per vehicle. The other thing just to jump in here, Joe that we have is -- we've launched multiple vehicles in parallel. So the start-up costs that Claire referred to, we were seeing all of those stacked up on top of each other, four different vehicles launching and ramping largely at the same time. Okay. Thanks a lot. And RJ, I guess this is a second question. A couple of quarters ago, you talked about the revised plans, some changes to CapEx timing, et cetera. I'm just wondering, in light of IRA and kind of appreciate you're still probably evaluating that. But like does that cause you to reevaluate the plans again and maybe accelerating or reaccelerating some of that in-house cell development?
Because I think that was one of the things that maybe had a sort of slight pushup, but the return profile on that investment seems to be greatly accelerated versus what you were thinking at the time and then obviously also directly impacts the financials of the rest of your business. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Yes. I mean, there's -- as you know, there are still some moving pieces with IRA, but we think this is a really powerful step and an important step by the U. S. government to really both create strong tailwinds not only for electrification but also for the build-out of a domestic supply base around battery cells. And so this is -- we couldn't be more excited about this, and it's certainly driving shifts in how we think about the overall battery supply chain.
And it's not just the cells, it's also the core materials that go into the cells, lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, some of the key precursor materials are areas we're spending a lot of time focusing on. And not only making sure we have security supply as we think out through the end of the decade, but making sure that, that supply qualifies for all the benefits associated with the IRA bill.
Now at the cell level, particularly important for us as we think about our two platform vehicles, this is something that has long been the plan to have domestically produced cells that would go into the vehicle. This just puts greater emphasis and importance on achieving that and achieving that as quickly as possible. Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi, everybody. You mentioned again that you have the funding through late 2025 with cash on hand, excluding this JV plant. And just wanted to confirm what that means. So by late 2025, you will have ramped up Normal and presumably funded most of Georgia assembly. I just wanted to make sure that, that's correct. And you didn't mention anything about -- anything new at least about vertical integration into batteries or cathode active material. Is that part of your funding plan just to the extent that it's important, particularly for the R2? Thanks, Rod. As we've talked about in the past, we remain confident in our cash on hand through 2025. And as we've also spoken about, we will opportunistically evaluate, right, opportunities for us to invest in high-growth, high-return options for Rivian on a go-forward basis. And as you heard from RJ's last comments there around a lot of the work that our team is doing across the board as it pertains to securing cell raw materials and the R&D and build-out and capabilities that we have in-house here. Those are all things that we're currently evaluating and working on as an organization as well.
And the embedded guidance that we do have does certainly consider some meaningful investments in that cell road map as we sit here today and look out at the building blocks for that future state opportunity. What the guidance doesn't include today is really much more of the large-scale manufacturing build-out of our cells, which would follow, obviously, the development and build-out of our R2 platform as we've spoken about in the past. So those are our core items that I just wanted to call out as you think about the building blocks and road map to that cash on hand through 2025. Okay, all right. That's helpful. Is it possible that, that can change prior to the ramp of the R2? Or is that something that just it takes a longer time to kind of get that pulled together? Rod, as Claire said, a lot of what's already built into our plan is the development and pilot -- the funding for all the development pilot activities associated with our domestic cells as well as building out some of the raw material cathode active material supply chain. But above and beyond that, as we think about what the future lines look like, part of that planning exercise is to create opportunities for us to take a decision with enough time in advance to have impact in that 2026 and beyond time frame. So those are decisions we'll take. And we look at them through the lens of recognizing the need to raise capital for things that we believe have very strong return profiles. Building domestic battery cells is one of those certainly.
I'd also say that this is something that we view as a must-have over time, so it's just a question of how quickly those activities ramp up in terms of production capacity. And just lastly, you're going to be producing over 10, 000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. And I presume that, that benefits, to some extent, but not fully from the second shift and you're still constrained by supply chain. Can you just give us any color you might have on what the -- where you are in the S-curve now, what the trajectory might look like from here just because there are -- obviously, there are people who are reporting some push-out for the R1S vehicles. So wondering if that has any implications for what the ramp looks like. Yes. The second shift is now up and running. We're building vehicles on if those vehicles are in delivered to customers, which is exciting. In ramping a second shift, of course, it's additional team, it's additional -- it's a lot of additional hours every week of time building vehicles. But it does have a ramp curve associated with it. And now while the ramp curve is much faster than what we went through on the first shift, as we brought the lineup and brought the plant up, it's not as if it starts immediately at 100% output.
So we're going through that ramp now. It is going well, as you called out in your question. We're very much cognizant of the limitations of supply chain, and that was -- as you recall, we talked about this in the last call, that was actually what drove the timing of the second shift coming online. It was we want to ensure before we brought on a large group of additional team members, make sure that we would have the parts to build the vehicles.
So as we stand here today, that is ramping. It's going well. The first shift continues to make improvements. As Claire referenced before, we're very much focused not just on the ramp but also on operational efficiencies and cost efficiencies, many of which come implicitly just through achieving higher output of the plant and leveraging more of our fixed costs more efficiently across more volume. But we're very much focused on fully ramping the second shift and going into 2023 strong. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one, on the R2 and the delay to 2026 from 2025 previously, can you talk a bit about what's changed there, and maybe also how this changes, if at all, your investment plans for the period up to 2025? Sure, Charles. This doesn't represent a material change in the product by any means. This is really reflective of making sure that the production site is prepared. We have the appropriate amount of time to go through the ramp-up phase, leveraging a lot of lessons learned as we've gone through the ramp of the R1P, the R1S, the EDV 700 and the EDV 500 over the last 12 months. So those ramps have informed our thinking on making sure that we have as close to a flawless ramp as possible with R2.
Now in terms of investment dollars, we're -- one of the things Claire and I spend a lot of time with our -- with the teams on is working very hard to push off payments on some of the CapEx as much as we can. But ultimately, some of these things require us to spend over the course of next year and, of course, into 2024 as well. Got it. And then on production, so I think to meet your 25,000 target, you need to average about 850 units a week in the final quarter. Can I ask if you've exceeded that rate in any of the weeks so far? Or that a missing component may have impacted production so far? And then maybe along the lines of a prior question, thinking into next year, should we think that quarter-on-quarter growth is kind of linear through next year or will there be some seasonality to that? The overall -- the way to think about the growth as we look at this both week-over-week, quarter-over-quarter is it's a symphony of not just what we're doing in our plant but also of our supply chain, as you referenced. And looking into 2023, we do see healthy growth quarter-over-quarter. We do have some planned downtime at the end of the year as we make some line improvements and capacity increases across the plant. This is the end of 2023. We've talked about this before.
And then in the first quarter of this coming year, and Claire and I both referenced this earlier, we are integrating our Enduro Drive unit and our LFP pack into the EDV platform. And so that's new battery pack, new drive unit, and of course, with that, a host of related changes. So that introduction of a new propulsion platform, which provides considerable cost improvement which we're really excited about, that will take some time. And we've built into the plan for next year really the appropriate time to go through the quality loops and training to make sure that it's a real -- it's a seamless launch. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord. Your line is open. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just quickly, you recently had a recall and I'm curious if you could share your thoughts on how your service department performed and how you see those facilities and personnel ramping over the next 12 months? Thanks, George. Just as a point of background, we had a recall for a torque fastener in one of our suspension components. And it called for inspection and tightening, which the operation takes a couple of minutes on a vehicle. And this was a really remarkable opportunity for us to demonstrate the benefit and the value of a direct service network. So we, today, have completed that operation on 83% of our fleet, with about 10 -- line of sight to another 10% that's currently scheduled.
So the speed at which we were able to very rapidly address this across the entire fleet and to do it moments after the decision was made to do this voluntary recall, to have our service leadership immediately working on deploying this and within hours, provide -- performing these first inspections in operations. And then as you just heard me say, within weeks, to have now over 83% of the vehicles complete is really something we're proud of and our customers saw that as well.
The ease at which the process was for customers was great, where we could go to their homes, where we can go to their places of business. In some cases, they would come into service locations, but we tried to make it as seamless as possible. And ultimately, I think the transparency in which we handled the situation was appreciated by our customers. Thanks. And just if I could ask one more. There's been some recent high-profile missteps in autonomy. And one of your competitors stated that it may not be critical for them to develop that technology in-house. I'm just curious as whether your view has been updated on that and whether you think it's critical to have your autonomous offering developed in-house. Yes. There's a -- within the autonomous space, there's a broad spectrum of ways to approach it. And I'd say to oversimplify, you have very hardware-heavy systems where a vehicle have $100-plus thousand worth of sensor set and compute. And then you have more hardware constrained systems that are designed to be deployed on vehicles that are purchased by customers where you have thousands of dollars of sense unit compute.
And our approach is to focus on the latter, where we're developing an in-house autonomous platform that will grow in capability but using a more constrained set of sensors, in our case, a very camera-heavy and radar-heavy platform. And so this is something that we do believe is really important as we talk about not just highway assist features but growing above and beyond what we see today in the Level 2 space. And this takes time but it certainly benefits from having a very large deployed fleet with vehicles that are driving many millions of miles.
As of today, our vehicles have driven over 92.5 million miles, which is great, but all those miles contribute to great learning opportunities to build and grow this platform. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thank you very much. First, a quick question around how do we think about some of the units and company economics going forward. So I guess in the quarter, you've had quite a bit of an improvement in cash, R& D and SG&A type of spending. Do you view these as a new run rate that is sustainable or especially as volume increases? Or how should we think about it?
And then at the unit level, obviously, nice to see the improvement in, I guess, the gross losses. What would be sort of like the reflect the run rate, production rate or cadence that you need to achieve to sort of essentially shrink these losses and bring that more into a positive territory as we look at it? Thanks, Emmanuel. First off, as you noted, we're really encouraged with the progress that we've made to prudently manage our operating expenses across the board, and you're seeing that now through the performance in our Q3 OpEx itself. As it pertains to more so of the baseline, our expectation is from an R&D perspective, that those R&D expenses will increase in Q4 relative to the level of spend in Q3. And that's largely the result of a lot of the development work that is underway for the introduction of our LFP pack and Enduro Drive unit in the commercial van program itself.
So there's a lot of development builds that are happening in the backdrop that will contribute to that overall increase in R&D that we expect to see in Q4. But we do expect to continue to manage our OpEx spend in aggregate as we're driving a lot of capital efficiency, while at the same time, we're investing heavily in the customer experience. So on an ongoing basis, we're continuing to open up additional service centers and our charging network, things of that nature, which contributes to that overall SG&A balance for us but also driving incredible efficiency across every dimension in our control as we're scaling the business on a go-forward basis as well.
And then to answer the second question you had on unit economics and what that looks like on a go-forward basis, I think one of the pieces that's most important to first understand is today, as you look at our cost of goods sold, the majority of that COGS per unit is really fixed costs within the business. And so the biggest lever we have is really focused on our ramp from a production perspective.
So maybe one thing that I think would be helpful is really providing you guidance as it pertains to the core inputs and drivers as we take our gross margins from current state to the path to positive unit economics in 2024.
And as we've talked about in the past, we expect to see a material step change in gross margin in that walk from current state to that 2024-time frame. And the biggest lever, not surprisingly, is really that fixed cost leverage as well as our opportunity to move beyond some of the start-up-related costs that you heard RJ and myself talk a bit about that we've already seen from a progress perspective, Q3 versus Q2. That reflects about two-thirds of the margin walk. So just wanted to make sure that you had a sense for just the magnitude of how important ramp is from an overall unit economic perspective.
The second key driver for us is associated with pricing. As we've talked about in the past, the post-March 1 configured preorders that we have in our order book reflect a $93, 000 average ASP. And we've got a lot of really exciting next-generation technologies that will be coming into the fold as well that allows us to believe that, that ASP could even drive meaningfully higher on a go-forward basis as well. So that's the second core lever in that economic walk.
And then finally, last but certainly not least, is really all of the core focus and work that we're doing right now around the reduction of our bill of materials. So importantly, the engineering and design changes and the road map we have in place to drive meaningful cost savings within that bill of materials over the next couple of years.
And then finally, all of the work that our procurement teams are doing around commercial cost-down opportunities as we continue to scale the business and importantly, work hand-in-hand with our supply chain partners and as Rivian continues to grow out its own manufacturing capacity and drive better unit economics for the business. That's incredibly detailed and helpful. Can I just ask a quick clarification on this and then I have a question on free cash flow? But the fact that you're, I guess, facing these targets and walk on 2024, does that correspond or match with the specifics of that unit number where you think that these economics essentially work with the volume is at the right place. So I guess what happens in between, I guess? We'll continue to see ongoing performance and improvement as we scale, especially given the magnitude of how important ramp is across the board. And so the important piece here is that in 2024, you see each of these key levers really in place as it pertains to production ramp, as it pertains to Rivian moving to those post-March 1 preorder base, and importantly, as you think about the composition of a lot of the engineering design changes that we have from a road map perspective, that all come together to drive that meaningful step change in gross profit. Okay, that's clear. And then on the free cash flow side, so with some of the efficiencies in CapEx this year but also some of it being, I think, timing into next year, how should we think about CapEx going forward? I think your previous view was maybe low $2 billion year in, year out. Should 2023 be ahead of this as a result of some of these movements? We still expect that CapEx should be in that low $2 billion area as well, even despite the fact that there will be some push of CapEx spend from 2022 to 2023. Okay. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. IRA was pretty new after the -- when you last reported. Just trying to get your latest thoughts. You mentioned LFP and that's sort of hitting early next year. There's a little uncertainty around how that might impact LFP insomuch as sort of from check suppliers and the rules are pretty tough there. Do you still think LFP makes sense longer term? And also on the commercial credit side, I mean, how does that work with some of your customers? Are they going to capture most of the credit benefit or are you able to kind of get some of that back to your margin? With regards to LFP, this is a cell, just to speak to it probably as a chemistry, it works really well in vehicles that require high cycle life, so vehicles that see lots of charge/discharge cycles relative to a high nickel cell. And so commercial applications are really a perfect application from a cycle life point of view. Further, the lower volumetric energy density associated with an LFP cell fits nicely into a vehicle that's physically large because you have the space to fit the pack to achieve enough energy storage but to do it in a slightly larger space. So we're quite bullish on LFP.
And interestingly, with regards to IRA, there's not a stringent requirement for commercial applications of source to cell. And so this is really important. So the $7, 500 credit for low GVW commercial vehicles, low gross vehicle weight commercial vehicles stands regardless of source of cell. And as we talked about in the last call, the size of those incentives grow as you move into higher gross vehicle weight classes.
Now the second thing I'd point out is we also do believe that the supply chain will evolve. The inherent benefits I referenced at a high level of an LFP chemistry for high cycle life applications are real. There are meaningful advantages. And so we see a lot of opportunity to make sure there's a domestic supply chain for both the production of LFP cells but also for the cathode active material as well as some of the other precursor materials.
Above and beyond that, of course, by the nature of an LFP cell, you remove nickel and you remove cobalt, so from an IRA compliance point of view, it's actually an easier chemistry to achieve compliance on, notwithstanding the fact that there's not, as you already pointed out, LFP supply chains for building the cells in the U.S. today. But certainly, from a raw material supply point of view, it is an easier cell long term to maintain that compliance. And on the commercial credits, I mean, do you think your customers will get that benefit? Because I'm not sure some of us think I feel like there might have been cost-plus arrangements for some of the vehicles. Do we believe the -- our customers, specifically, our large commercial customer that we're launching our commercial business with will achieve some of those credits. There's also credits that are manufacturer-facing with IRA. So we're very cognizant of managing both sides of those credits, both the consumer or the customer-facing as well as the manufacturer-facing. Got it. And just last question. On the joint venture with Mercedes, how does the production split work? Is there a fixed amount? Because I mean, is there any concern because Mercedes obviously has an established footprint there. So is it just sort of you each have an allocation of production? Or if there's demand, you could take over most of the production? How does that sort of work in the agreement? At this point, we're still working through a lot of the specifics of our agreement. We've signed and announced an MOU around this joint venture, but there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of defining exactly how it will work. Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a couple around the planned increase in production here in 4Q. I think squeezing from your reiterated full year outlook, it implies about a 45% sequential growth on top of 3Q's, I think, 67% improvement. So firstly, you mentioned being short a specific component in 3Q. Are you able to share what that component is or if you've cycled past that shortage? And what has been your experience so far here in 4Q in the first 5 weeks of the quarter, et cetera, maybe with regards to the second shift, too? Ryan, we've talked about before just the improvement we're seeing broadly within the supply chain, in particular, relative to the first half of this year, which we've spent some time talking about just how challenging that was. So that improvement, we're absolutely seeing and continue to see. But with a vehicle that has hundreds of suppliers and thousands of components coming from suppliers, it only takes 1 part from 1 supplier to stop the line. And as Claire referenced earlier, we had 5 days we lost already this quarter because of a single component supply shortage.
Now that component and the supplier of that component is something we spent a lot of time working really closely with them to avoid having this happen again and have built robust contingencies to manage this risk going forward. And we do believe that there's going to continue to be challenges certainly with supply chain, but we do believe with this specific instance that we've settled it to allow us to continue to ramping without those types of interruptions. Okay, very helpful. And then just lastly, I think last quarter, you had talked about preserving free cash outlook by deferring some CapEx spending that was discretionary into next year. Now with the pushout of the R2 a bit, how are you’re thinking about that? Are you maybe looking to trim capital expenditures next year relative to what might have otherwise been the plan? As you heard, we both took down our guidance from a CapEx perspective this year. And so part of that is a shift into next year. And then next year does have some incremental benefit in that we're not spending at the same capacity towards the plant build-out in Georgia. But in aggregate, as I mentioned, we still expect to be in that low $2 billion area even with those movements. Okay, very helpful. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to RJ for closing remarks. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. It was great to have such a broad spectrum of questions here today. Just to reiterate some of the points Claire and I both made throughout the call, we're really looking forward to the continued ramp of our production line. The impact this has not only on the economics of our business but very importantly on ensuring we deliver to customers, excited customers that help us to bring them their vehicles, get them in their R1T, their R1S as soon as possible, that's a critical focus for us.
And as we look out into 2023, the continued ramp and continued growth in deliveries is our core, core focus. And with that, of course, driving efficiency into and across the business, not just on our cost of goods sold but across our operating expenses as well as how we deploy capital from a CapEx point of view. So with that, thank you, everybody, for joining, and we look forward to our next earnings call. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Rivian's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today's call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity; industry trends; business operations; strategy and goals; our production ramp and manufacturing capacity expansion; our future products and product enhancements, including R2; and our expectations regarding vehicle production and deliveries.
Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties in associated with our business, which are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter.
Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2022 is a transformational year for us. We fought through a difficult operating environment to ramp the R1T, the R1S and the EDV, with total production of 24,337 vehicles for the year. Beyond ramp, we focused our product teams on our next generation of in-vehicle technologies in the R2 platform. I want to thank our team, suppliers and partners for their grit and determination in helping Rivian achieve its targets.
In the fourth quarter, we increased production over 10,000 units. This represents a 36% increase over the third quarter of 2022. We maintain a vehicle backlog that provides clear demand visibility well into 2024. We launched our Adventure Network, which gives customers a smoother charging experience. We expanded our service infrastructure to 28 physical service locations in addition to nearly 200 mobile service vans and we pushed a range of major software updates to our customers.
Our core priorities for 2023 are ramping production of our R1 and RCV platforms, driving cost reductions, developing the R2 platform and its future technologies and delivering an outstanding end-to-end customer experience. In my role as CEO, my most important responsibility is to make sure we have the right leaders and the right organizational design in place to drive focus and execute on our priorities. It's great to see the very capable and experienced leaders we've added over the last year.
Equally important to ramping production is our drive towards profitability. We are focused on reducing our bill of materials, conversion costs, logistics costs and overall operating expenses. Core to this is our close work with our supplier partners to lower our material costs through new engineering solutions as well as revisiting some of the customer and commercial negotiations that were agreed to years ago when Rivian was still in prelaunch. In support of these efforts, we held a Supplier Day at the end of 2022, where we hosted over 400 members of our supply chain at the plant to demonstrate the growth and the scale of what we're building. Our supplier partners are engaged and fully understand the benefits of us achieving profitability as quickly as possible.
One of the enablers to reduce our material cost is the introduction of our future technologies. Earlier this month, we started producing saleable units of our in-house Enduro drive unit. Enduro is our single-motor drive unit, and in our commercial van platform, we use it in our front-drive application, and in the R1 platform, as a dual motor setup, we use it for all-wheel drive application. The Enduro drive units are also accompanied by our new lithium iron phosphate battery packs for our commercial van line. These LFP packs are ideally suited for commercial use cases due to their low cost and really the durability of this chemistry.
Another important example of our technology development that I'm excited to introduce is the 390-mile R1S max pack variant. We begin deliveries on this vehicle this fall, and we expect high demand for this new offering. The R1S max pack will launch with the dual motor configuration, leveraging our Enduro drive unit, and will deliver 0 to 60 acceleration in around 3.5 seconds. And when we couple that with our full air suspension and electro hydraulic damping system, it will really deliver incredible on-road and off-road performance.
The purpose of our investments in software, electronics, drive units and batteries is to improve performance and to create long-term structural cost advantages. These technologies will serve as the foundation for our R2 platform. Our production ramp and the introduction of multiple vehicle platforms has equipped our team with valuable manufacturing operations and product development experience in a short period of time. We're taking advantage of these learnings and are aggressively applying this experience to our first mass market vehicle, the R2 as well as to our new manufacturing facility in which we'll build the R2 located in Georgia with the goal of establishing a considerably lower cost structure.
Speaking of R2, we're really at an exciting and defining moment for the program. We have members across our organization, from design to engineering to manufacturing, coming together to develop what we believe is a true category-defining platform. Over the next 6 months, we'll be finalizing the majority of the core engineering and sourcing decisions that will drive how the R2 product line is built and the speed at which we can ramp production to profitability.
We spent years creating our brand and award-winning set of products that drive excitement and attract new customers to what we're doing. The validation received from our customers and media continues to be strong. In fact, the R1T received several new accolades, including being named Best Ownership Experience among Premium Battery Electric Vehicles by J.D. Power.
In addition to its Editors' Choice award, the R1T was also included in Car and Driver's coveted 10Best award for 2023. And along with that, it was praised as being the best driving pickup Car and Driver has ever tested. In consumer reports, customer satisfaction survey, Rivian was rated among the highest across all categories with our R1T being the highest-rated truck. We've also received the highest safety rating of TOP SAFETY PICK+ from IIHS, and that's passing IIHS's new tougher standards for 2023 across all categories.
On our go-to-market side of the business, which includes our customer engagement, service, delivery and demand generation teams, we've experienced rapid growth over the past year as we built the foundation for our end-to-end customer experience and software and service offerings. We need to execute against our robust customer backlog and remain focused on our customers as we scale our 150,000 units of annual capacity in Normal into ultimately multiple production plants around the world.
The enthusiasm for our products and our brand, combined with the progress we're making on our future vehicles and technologies along with the strong team that we've built, gives me confidence in our ability to help drive the massive impact we need this planet and the transition to a carbon-free economy. With that, I'll pass the call over to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I want to reinforce the important steps we took during 2022 to drive towards profitability. Our goal is to build Rivian for the long term, to build a company capable of adapting during good times as well as challenging ones. In the last year, we took intentional measures to focus our product portfolio and drive a lower cost structure.
Operating expenses in the second half of 2022 fell 21% as compared to the first half of the year. For the full year 2022, operating expenses were in line with 2021 results, while we continue to invest in and scale our delivery and go-to-market operations and next-generation technologies. In addition, our team was able to reduce our capital expenditures for 2022 to $1.4 billion versus $1.8 billion in 2021 due to the fact that our equipment and facility costs were more highly concentrated leading into our start of production in Normal.
We're encouraged by this progress and recognize there is an additional opportunity to drive greater efficiency. We are concentrating our investments and resources on growing the consumer business while continuing to leverage our existing commercial platform. We believe these core aspects of our company represent the greatest levers to maximize our impact and drive attractive financial returns.
I will now review our fourth quarter 2022 results. The last 12 months were characterized by economic uncertainty as well as significant supply chain volatility across the industry. By focusing on factors within our control, our team was able to achieve meaningful milestones. During the fourth quarter, we produced 10,020 vehicles and delivered 8,054 vehicles, which generated $663 million of revenue. We generated negative gross profit of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a lower of cost or net realizable value, LCNRV, adjustment.
As discussed in the past, the LCNRV adjustment breaks down the value of certain inventory and records losses on firm purchase commitments to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale. As of December 31, 2022, LCNRV was $920 million as compared to $95 million as of December 31, 2021. These charges are expected to continue through 2023.
However, as we reduced cost of goods sold per vehicle by lowering material production, logistics and other costs, we anticipate that the total charge will decline. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in 2024 and therefore expect by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges and losses on firm purchase commitments associated with the production at our Normal plant.
In addition to LCNRV, there were factors which negatively impacted our cost of goods sold that we do not believe are reflective of our long-term cost structure. The most significant driver continues to be our production levels. Producing highly vertically integrated vehicles at low volumes on lines designed for higher volumes means we currently carry more overhead per vehicle produced. This impact has and will continue to be magnified during the ramp of our second shift in production as we introduce new technologies like our LFP battery pack and Enduro motor, for which we stopped the commercial production line for the majority of the first quarter of 2023.
Additionally, because we are in an LCNRV position, we do not fully capitalize our logistics and conversion costs into inventory, which can lead to volatility in our cost of goods sold based on the amount of inbound materials we received in a particular quarter or the difference between our vehicle production and deliveries as we saw in Q4 2022.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 fell $1.3 billion as compared to the same period last year. Approximately $1.1 billion of this difference was due to higher noncash expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021, including a donation to Forever by Rivian and stock-based compensation in conjunction with the IPO. The remaining reduction of approximately $200 million was due to lower cash expenses associated with the operations of our business. We continue to prioritize investments in our core in-vehicle technologies and customer experience while also driving additional focus and cost optimization across the business.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was negative $1.5 billion, which compares to negative $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. This excludes the capacity under our $750 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We continue to monitor the economic environment and believe we have a high level of flexibility regarding the cadence of our growth investments.
I want to take this opportunity to highlight important operational changes we're making in Normal. In addition to the commercial van line shutdown during the first quarter of 2023 which we expect to result in a drop in overall production and deliveries relative to Q4 2022, we also expect to be taking both the R1 and EDV production lines down for a week during the fourth quarter of 2023 to prepare for a capacity change which will happen in 2024.
In the first half of 2024, we intend to take production of the plant down for a few weeks to implement new technologies into our vehicles and shift the overall capacity of the plant to be about 55% R1. While the incorporation of these new technologies temporarily impacts production, they are expected to provide improved vehicle performance and range and deliver cost reductions that are critically important to our path to profitability.
Now turning to our 2023 outlook. We are guiding to 50,000 vehicles produced for the year. This represents a doubling of year-over-year production while also accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with the supply chain and integration of our new technologies. We expect the ramp of our second shift for the R1 line to continue to progress through the first quarter. We expect full year production to be back-end weighted due to supply constraints we believe will alleviate in the second half of the year and the commercial line downtime we're taking in Q1 2023.
During 2023, our gross margin is expected to remain negative, but we anticipate improving on a dollar basis for the year as we reduce our cost of goods sold per vehicle produced, improve our average selling prices per vehicle and begin to see our LCNRV charge decline. For 2023, total operating expenses are expected to modestly increase as compared to 2022. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be negative $4.3 billion in 2023, an improvement of $900 million versus 2022.
We continue to rationalize our capital expenditures due to a greater focus on our core business. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be $2 billion driven by additional investment in our Normal and Georgia facilities, next generation technologies and the continued build out of our go-to-market operations. In addition to our 2023 guidance, I wanted to address the capital needs of the business over the medium term. The largest lever in our forecast is the swing from negative $1 billion of gross profit in Q4 2022 to a step change in positive gross margin in 2024.
There are 3 key levers that enable this improvement. First, the most impactful driver is the per-unit reduction of labor overhead and ramp expenses as our large-scale plant produces a greater number of units. With the addition of our second shift, the plant in Normal is currently staffed to produce a significantly higher number of units than our current run rate. For context, these expenses represent 2/3 of the bridge from our current COGS per unit to what we expect by the end of 2024.
The second area is our material costs. We have a detailed road map of both engineering and commercial cost downs. As RJ mentioned, our recent Supplier Day demonstrated the win-win opportunity for our suppliers to participate in Rivian's growth. The final bucket is price. The implementation of our reservation system in early 2022 provides us the pricing flexibility to accommodate the introduction of new products, technologies and inflationary pressures.
While most of our deliveries today are based on pre-March 1, 2022 pricing, we expect to see a meaningful step change in average selling price over the next 2 years as we introduce new higher-priced variants as well as move to our post March 1 preorders. In addition to the gross profit improvements I outlined, we expect to see significant leverage of our operating expenses over this period as we leverage our R&D and SG&A expenses over a much larger sales base.
We also anticipate being able to maintain our capital expenditures in the low $2 billion area over this time frame. Our objective continues to be driving towards profitability and our prudent deployment of capital. From a cash burn perspective, we expect 2024 to improve versus 2023 by approximately 40%, enabled by the step change we see in gross profit. In 2025, we expect our cash burn to improve meaningfully versus 2024 as we have a full year of production at our new price points and the incorporation of our next generation technologies.
We remain confident that our cash and cash equivalents can fund our operations through 2025. We continue to evaluate a variety of capital markets available to Rivian ranging across the capital structure. We plan to employ a portfolio-based approach as we look to maintain a strong balance sheet position.
In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow target. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Just a couple of things maybe just to kick things off. Do you have an estimate for the magnitude of the LCNRV losses you expect in 2023? Thanks, Rod. As we think about the LCNRV, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right, today, we sit with a $920 million charge, and we expect that charge to be fully offset or out of our P&L in effect as we approach positive unit economics in that 2024 time frame as outlined.
And so what -- the guidance that I would provide for you is as you think about the cadence of that $920 million going to 0 is it won't necessarily be a linear path over the course of the next several quarters, but we will start to see those impacts even as early as Q1 as we start to reduce the material costs within our vehicles, and importantly, as we think about the technology introductions that we have in EDV, for example, where we introduced the LFP pack and Enduro drive unit that drives a material step change in material cost there.
So for example, the marginal unit that we're producing today for that EDV is now profitable due to some of those changes that we've had from a technology introduction perspective. But we'll continue to see what's been a headwind throughout the course of 2022 become a tailwind as we look at '23 and '24. Okay. So it's actually going to decline. So it would be a subtraction from your cost of goods sold, just to clarify that, in 2023? That's correct. Okay. And RJ, I was just hoping maybe you can give us some preliminary thoughts on how different the R2 cost structure will need to be compared to R1 to be competitive when that vehicle comes out? And what's your visibility into achieving those? Maybe talk a little bit about -- we think about batteries primarily when we think about that, but what are some of the non-battery opportunities that you see? Are there any unconventional design or manufacturing innovations that you're looking to implement for that vehicle? Thanks, Rod. As we think about the R2 platform, it's leveraging a lot of -- some of the technologies we're going to be introducing into R1 in terms of our updated electronics architecture and network architecture where we work to really consolidate a lot of compute functions into a smaller number of ECUs, which simplifies the harness, simplifies the number of compute platforms you have across the vehicle.
As Claire mentioned, our Enduro drive units and the, really, focus on vertically integrating our propulsion platform from a drive unit point of view drives considerable cost changes into R1. But we take those improvements, and we leverage those heavily for R2. And in the case of the vehicle, as you think about body, interior chassis system, we've really learned a lot in developing and launching R1 and the EDV program.
And so the way we've looked at the design of the product is really through the lens of where we can see opportunities to consolidate parts, so larger single piece stampings, use of parts consolidation through extrusions or castings. And that part consolidation not only reduces the number of parts of the vehicle, but as a result, there's less joints, there's less things that need to be attached to one another. It simplifies the assembly process. It simplifies the sourcing process.
And so that's a major, major focus for us with the R2 product. And really the magic of it or the core of it is to ensure that the brand essence and the excitement of what we build is still fully captured in the R2 product line, but of course, achieving it with a meaningfully lower cost structure.
The other thing I'd just point out is, and I noted this in my opening remarks, we're in a very different position with our supply chain today than we were when we were sourcing a lot of our supply components for R1. A lot of the components or a vast majority of them are sourced in 2018, 2019, well before we launched the product, well before we saw the incredible response from customers around the brand.
So today, as we're now making those supplier selections, negotiating the supplier contracts in R2, we're not only using the R2 contracts to help drive better cost into R1, but we're achieving much, much more aggressive cost and much more aggressive pricing with all the various components across the vehicle. So in aggregate, we are going to see a materially lower cost structure for R2, and that's, as I said, that's foundational to how we think about that product. It sounds like, RJ, you're thinking about things like Giga castings and just a lot of innovations in reducing the number of parts in the structure of a vehicle. Do you, at this point, have visibility into that? And are you starting to get visibility into what the component cost structure will be for the R2?
And just lastly, do you have any color on -- as we're sort of bridging to profitability, for gross profit profitability, what kind of volume targets are you thinking about as you look out to 2024? You mentioned the 150,000 units of capacity, but do you think you can get to at least 100,000 in that time frame? Well, just to your first point on how we're thinking about component design or system design across the vehicle. One of the things we spend a lot of time on across all the different tech layers of the product is looking for opportunities at a holistic level or at a system level to reduce complexity and reduce the parts.
So whether that's in, I'll take, for example, in our Enduro drive unit, we took the gearbox, the motor and the inverter, those are typically 3 different subassemblies that are mechanically fastened together. And in the case of Enduro, those -- we call it 3 in 1, those 3 systems are captured into 1 casting. So we designed this system really holistically to take 3 different parts, combine it into 1, reduce the number of fasteners, of course, increase the assembly and build time, or decrease the assembly and build time for the drive unit.
But that mentality, that mindset we're applying to everything, whether it's a seat frame, whether it's a door system, a drive unit, as I just described, of course, body structure is a big opportunity for this as well. So this is something that we carry into every design review. It's part of the design criteria that we approach the vehicle with, and it's one of the big enablers that we have because we vertically integrated so much of the technology.
I mentioned it before, but the ability to dramatically reduce the number of computers in the vehicle, the number of ECUs through a zonal architecture, we have a computer in the front, the computer in the back, computer in the middle, so to speak, rather than separate domain-based or function-based computers, which is historically how you've seen vehicles done today, and it's largely a result of an outsourced model around electronics. So these are some of the core focus areas where we're leveraging what we've built in terms of capability and what we've built in terms of technology as we go into R2. And Rod, maybe... And the volume? [Indiscernible] directly on the volume question that you have there as well. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, today we have 65,000 units of R1 capacity in the plant at Normal, and we're increasing that capacity so that 55% or call it, 85,000 units will become R1 capacity as we re-rate the lines midyear next year. And so next year, we'll have both the impact of having a multi-week shutdown as we re-rate the plant to add that incremental R1 capacity.
And at that same time, we'll be introducing a number of the next generation technologies that RJ just talked about as well. And so we'll still be in a period whereby we'll be continuing to ramp out of that shutdown in midyear to produce more units in the back half of the year, but it really won't be until full year 2025, where we'll be ramping up the then re-rated capacity from an R1 perspective. So just to clarify what you're saying, are you saying that you're not going to have the 85,000 units of R1 capacity available for 2024? Or will you? It will be available. We're re-rating the lines midyear in 2024. And so from a full year perspective, we won't have the full year impact of that re-rate as we go through the process of a couple of weeks shutdown and then ramps back out of that shutdown in the back half of the year. Okay. But despite that, you're still thinking that you can get to gross profit in 2024? That's right. Okay. Just to clarify that, that's -- I could see -- it looks like you're going to have something like a $2 billion gross profit loss in 2023. Maybe there's half of the LCNRV benefit left from 2023 to 2024. That gives you maybe $1.5 billion, and you have a $13,000 price increase.
If that was applied this year, that would have been $650 million better. So that would have gotten you to maybe an $850 million gross profit loss. I guess the rest of it is whatever volume you're expecting plus lowered component costs. Is that fair as we think about the bridge to next year? As we think about that 2024 bridge, right, it's a combination of increased volumes that are driving significant fixed cost leverage within the business as we're continuing to ramp up production levels in the plant in Normal.
And then the next 2 core drivers for us is the reduction in our material costs, which you heard RJ talk a bit about, is really delivered through both the combination of engineering design changes in the vehicle through the introduction of these next generation technologies and then the commercial cost-down efforts that we have underway overall.
So I would guide you to about a 50-50 split as we think about the core drivers between commercial cost downs and engineering changes to drive the material cost reduction. And then at the same time, we have both the step change in pricing as we move past the pre-March 1, 2022 preorders, and then we also introduced some of the newer higher-priced variants into the fold as well that also further improves or increases ASP in 2024. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Just a first question around what's going on with suppliers. It sounds like there's still a fair amount of bottlenecks there. Just curious if you could sort of elucidate where those specifically are, how much they're holding you back. And I mean I kind of applaud you, RJ, for having that Supplier Day.
It sounds like it's a good thing to build those relationships, but it sounds like you felt like you needed to do that both for sort of comfort on their part, but also for you to get maybe closer to them and pull them along. So I'm just trying to understand what those constraints are at the moment, how much they're holding you back in 2023 and why you need to kind of get in there and kind of do that bear hug on that Supplier Day. Yes. Thanks, John. As we look at 2022, there's a lot of challenges just with some of the surprises and the things that we didn't expect in terms of supply interruptions and component availability. Now as we look at 2023, we have much better visibility and a much clearer picture of access to supply and where there are going to be challenges or constraints. And very different than where we were last year. That visibility allows us to focus on exactly what will go wrong or what will be a gap.
And as I said today in the numbers that Claire referenced earlier in terms of guidance, it really reflects supply constraint, in our case, around power semiconductors. And this is being addressed through working hard with suppliers, but also as I talked about bringing up the new driving at the Enduro drive unit, we've sourced the power semiconductors for this in a way that allows us to have multiple to continue to ramp.
So we have a different set of power semiconductor suppliers for our existing driving unit as a quad motor from what we have in the dual motor and in the single motor for the commercial van. So those changes of the new technology, along with the supplier relationships we've built, allow us to alleviate some of that constraint, but it will be the ultimate limiting factor for us this year.
And fortunately, unlike last year, we can plan around it. We have this building into what those constraints look like. So it's not going to be a surprise, which is why we're wanting to be thoughtful on how we guide here. RJ, there's a lot of people that want to understand what is sort of -- I mean, it's certainly not onetime because this is not going to ease that quickly, what's happening because of the supply chain side and what's happening because of what is not getting done sort of internally on a micro basis.
So is there a way to tease that out and say, hey, listen, if we had all the semis that we could get, we can actually be 100,000 units as opposed to 50,000 units this year, right? I mean is there a way to tease that out? Or is that getting too cute? Well, I think the issue we have is that the supply constraint is, by far and away, the biggest constraint. We talked about our second shifts coming online and the ramp of our second shift. We didn't really talk about why it's -- what's constraining that ramp, but it's ultimately -- it is component supply. And that's on the R1 line today. If you think about the commercial vehicle line, we're still running a single shift there.
So it's -- we wish we could have the components still to fully run the plant across all lines, across multiple shifts, but that's not the case. And as I think about power semiconductors, in addition to having multiple sources of supply, we also have different types of technologies. So we use both silicon carbide and silicon IGBTs, and we have some level of fungibility in how we apply those across the vehicle sets.
But it's -- I think you understand very well that some of the constraints that exist in silicon carbide are going to be challenging over the next year, and so we've worked really hard to set up our supply chain so as we come out of this year and into 2024, we're positioned to really grow. And of course, as we think about R2, this is a major consideration from a power module point of view. Okay. And then just lastly, real quick. CapEx at $2 billion is a little bit lower than we would have expected. Claire, is that the kind of thing that you can kind of run with as you're launching Georgia and the R2 and ultimately maybe the R3 at some point? Or could there be a significant step-up as that plant ramps in '24, '25, and we see the R3 come on there as well? Sure, John. As I talked about, our expectation is that we'll maintain our CapEx in the low $2 billion area over the next couple of years and the guidance reflects the continued build-out of our facility in Georgia, continued investment in our plant in Normal and then the continued investments that we have across our go-to-market operations as well as across the business in aggregate. So the way I would characterize it is that the $2 billion per year certainly sets us up in a position to launch R2 in Georgia in 2026, as we've talked about in the past. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Dutton with Evercore ISI. So given the target for positive gross margins in '24 and what we've heard about the road to reach this goal with the LCNRV phaseouts and rerates at the factory, in your mind, can '25 approach a normalized gross margin profile, assuming full capacity at Normal and price to normalization on the R1 platform prior to sort of R2 coming online? And a follow-up there, is that target still 15% to 20%? Sure. Our long-term vehicle gross margin target is 20%. And then through the introduction of additional software and services, we've guided to a long-term overall aggregate gross margin target of 25%. Our expectation is through the continued ramp of the R1 and EDV in Normal, we can certainly arrive at our target vehicle margins, and 2025 becomes really that sweet spot as volumes come together and we have our first full year production with the integration of our next generation technologies and price points as well.
So I have a lot of confidence around the cash flow generation that Normal can provide Rivian, and believe that Normal can support our operating expenses as a company as we continue to invest in the build-out of the R2 platform and get ready to start to launch that platform in Georgia in '26. Okay. That's helpful. And then just an accounting question for me. Could we have a brief description or explainer on the CapEx and liabilities bucket at the bottom of the cash flow statement? We can follow up with you with some details there. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Wanted to ask about the commentary on the preorders, and I see the comment that, that lasts into 2024. Maybe you can provide any additional voiceover. How have preorders trended year-to-date? And specifically, maybe you can -- you mentioned pricing as a tailwind. You have the higher pricing flowing through eventually. But given the price cut that we saw from one of your large EV competitors, how does potential for price cuts eventually factor into your calculus? Thanks, Dan. As you think about the R1 product line, this is really our flagship product line. It's -- we've built it and launched it to establish the brand and as part of that. The pricing levels and the segments through which these products are going to compete in, it's a larger set of vehicles, the 3-row SUV and 3-row pickup. The pricing levels really need to be compared to things that are in those segments, and we feel very strong about where we position the products.
The R1T, we bring online our standard pack, we'll start at $73,000, and the R1S is just around $80,000, 3-row SUV with very, very strong performance. So the positioning there, we feel confident. We made pricing adjustments in 2022, and we haven't further adjusted from there.
Certainly, as Claire noted, our reservation process now gives us more flexibility to make adjustments to pricing over time, but we do see the introduction of some of the new technologies and some of the new features to allow us to actually grow ASP, as Claire said, with not only the new prices coming on for post-March 1 orders, but also to reflect some of the new technologies that are going to be in the vehicle. Great. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the direction of some of the material costs. And I know you mentioned on your end, some initiatives to drive cost down. But I want to just ask about the raws because we've seen some cost moderation on the raws.
So maybe you can just talk about whether some of the raw material costs are coming down? Or I know there's a dynamic of contract resets. And so those might be higher year-over-year. So maybe you could just talk about the underlying BOM given the movement in some of the raw material costs. Sure. Today, we haven't seen those actually hit our financial statements because many of our contracts are actually backwards looking as it pertains to inflation index prices that are embedded within those contracts. And so we'll begin to see some of those benefits as we progress throughout the course of 2023 itself.
I would also say that embedded within our guidance, we've been a bit conservative of not forecasting really significant reductions in those material costs overall. So much more projecting more of the status quo of what we're seeing today on a go-forward basis. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. I'd just like to piggyback on the previous demand question, that preorder question. I know you're not disclosing the preorders, but given there have been so many high-profile admissions of a weakening environment for demand, particularly for EVs, I'm curious as to whether you could shed any light or color as to how your net preorders have been tracking? Certainly what we're witnessing in the macro and what we're seeing in terms of interest rate is, I think, across the industry, having an effect of moderating overall demand. But what we would say is, and as we think about it, the demand backlog that we have is very robust. It gives us a clear line of sight until well into 2024.
And with that, it really focuses the attention of the organization on satisfying this large backlog and ensuring that we can get customers vehicles. One of the biggest complaints, in fact our customer team tells me this every week, is around delivery timing. How can I get my vehicle sooner? Is there a way to get ahead in the line? So this is our core challenge today.
Now with that said, it's really important to note with the R2 program, we made comments on this earlier, the focus on cost and the focus on engineering the vehicles really to achieve a materially lower price point is key. And as we look out into middle of the decade, 2026 and beyond, this cost structure, we believe, is going to be really important. And some of the areas we've invested in terms of vertical integration, we think, will be foundational for delivering on those costs. Just as a follow-up, great segue into my question about vertical integration. I mean I'm sure you've read the same press releases that I have that some of your peers are getting incredibly deep into that. I mean they're partnering with mines, buying mines, buying stakes in mines and doing things that seem to be a little bit far field. I'm curious as to how much vertical integration in your opinion, is too much vertical integration? Do you think that longer term, that might be something that you might explore as well? Yes. Well, George, I think the core of the question is sort of pointing towards lithium. And your previous question talked about raw material costs, and this has certainly had the most outsized impact across the EV industry, with lithium hydroxide spot market price hovering around $80 a kilogram, up 4, 5x relative to what it was a year, 1.5 years ago.
So this is a real consideration as everyone, certainly ourselves included, thinking about what's the right sourcing relationships for lithium in lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, and we're certainly in midst of a lot of those discussions. And I think it's causing the material sources and, in our case, the manufacturers, the OEMs, to think about deal structures that are very different than what existed 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago.
That could involve ownership positions, but I think for the most part, the opportunities lie just more in unique structuring. And so we haven't announced anything on that front, but it's something I spend an enormous amount of time on and work very closely with some of the very large players in this space. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. You're burning through -- this year, you burned through over $6 billion in cash. You have $12 billion. So you have a couple more years of cash at this rate. I mean if I look at the guidance, adjusted EBITDA is supposed to improve a bit, the CapEx is higher, so it sounds like free cash flow may be modestly better this year, but not massively. What are your thoughts on the potential need to raise capital? When do you start making those decisions? Or should we see a pretty massive inflection in a couple of years? On -- we'll continue to look at a variety of capital market solutions to maintain our strong balance sheet position. We plan to execute a portfolio-based approach for our capital raising across the entirety of the capital structure. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well, we expect to see pretty significant moderation from a cash burn perspective in 2024 relative to 2023 as gross profit or the movement from negative gross profit to positive gross profit is a key lever in that walk of improvements. And then as we talked a bit about as well, 2025 is significant improvement from there as well. Got it. I think in the last call, you mentioned you're planning an LFP plant. That's not actually in the near-term horizon. Any thoughts on raising capital to accelerate that given the health at a higher rate that might apply there? Yes, Colin. As I referenced in the context of lithium supply, if you move slightly downstream from a battery supply point of view and thinking about IRA, there's going to need to be investment in new capacity. And the types of structures and arrangements to achieve that dedicated capacity, there's lots of different ways to look at that.
That's something, certainly, that's part of our plan and something that we're spending time on. We haven't announced anything on that front either, but it is a very important aspect of what we're doing in terms of creating new supply, creating supply that's IRA compliant, both in terms of raw material but also in terms of cell production. And you have your own LFP chemistry? Or do you have a partner for it? Or you had your own? So we've -- when we think about the build-out of our battery, overall battery portfolio, we have an internal team that's developing chemistry, and it's working to really understand across a variety of trade-offs how we think about what's the right cell for different duty cycles and for different applications. And that internal team also works very closely with some of our key partners to make sure that we can achieve the scale very quickly that we need to.
So in the case of what's in our vehicles today, it's a high nickel chemistry. That's something we've worked very closely with our supplier partner to develop that and to refine that to achieve the performance in our vehicles today. With the LFP that we're going to be launching shortly first in the commercial vans, that's in close partnership that we haven't yet announced, although those vehicles in the form of the vans will be on the road here very soon.
And then as we look forward, there's going to be portfolio of different partners and different approaches to achieve the scale we need across different cell form factors and cell chemistries, both high nickel and lithium iron phosphate. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. I wanted to get your thoughts on any impact to Rivian you see from the Inflation Reduction Act. I remember as that bill was being written, it was speculated it could have been various different proposals. But in the end, it only subsidized the lower-priced vehicles, right, and benefits those manufacturers that are making the batteries that are vertically integrated or partnered, which you have yet to do.
So do you see any benefit in charging or other tailwinds? And how do you expect or hope to or plan to position the company to better benefit from that act as the next several years play out? Yes. So I think the IRA bill, I've said this before, I think it's incredibly aggressive and appropriate to drive a broad scale shift towards electrification and to build out a supply chain within the U.S. And with that, in the case of our R1 product line, there's some tailwind, some benefits that it provides largely in the form of -- because we build modules in the U.S., we have a $10 per kilowatt hour benefit that's derived from IRA on the R1 platform. That's a manufacturing-facing benefit. But in terms of the consumer-facing credit, our vehicles aren't really applicable on the R1 platform.
Now in the case of R2, it's a very different story. In the case of R2, as alluded to in previous questions, it's really important that we ensure that the vehicle and the way we manufacture the vehicle and the batteries in the vehicle ensures IRA compliance. The price points need to be considerably lower and fall really right into the sweet spot as contemplated by IRA, and the sourcing of the critical materials plus the build of the cells, the manufacturing of the cells needs to be done such that we qualify for the $7,500 credit that is consumer-facing. So that's foundational to how we're thinking about the R2 program and platform and certainly plays into sourcing decisions and engineering decisions. Okay. Great. And also just a follow-up on that earlier Q&A around pricing, the up to 20% price cut on -- some of the Tesla models, Ford and some of the others, et cetera. But I'm sure there's passing along of lower input costs in all the battery metals, but is there anything else? It just seems like a large reduction, right? So how are you feeling about the demand, the new order intake level or whatnot for the prices that you're currently charging? I think as I was describing before, in the case of R1, we feel confident in the value proposition of what we're delivering at our pricing levels today. And if you were to compare, take, for example, the R1S to other 3-row SUVs that offer the level of range and performance that the R1S is delivering, it's really -- we think of it as it's a really good deal.
Of course, we get biased here, but 0 to 60 in 3 seconds, well over 300 miles of range. As we just announced today, we have a max pack range with 390 miles of range, which when coupled with the Enduro dual motor configuration delivers 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds. And to be able to deliver that at the types of pricing that we're talking about relative to the competitive set, it's positioned quite well.
Now as you said, there's been price reductions that we've seen on the order of 20% in vehicles that are more in the R2 market basket, if you will. And a lot of that segment has seen significant price inflation in the first half of 2022, and I think we saw the prices go up very rapidly.
And we, of course, saw the other side of that, which is the prices come down very rapidly. I think what we're seeing today is reflective of a more stable and sustainable long-term pricing model for vehicles that are in the sort of midsized crossover and SUV segment versus what we were seeing in the mid -- early parts of 2022 into middle late part of 2022. Our last question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. One for me, please, was about the re-rating discussion and specifically around the timing and how much of the capacity is being shifted towards R1. I had thought that R1 capacity might be adjusted to something like 2/3 of the facility and perhaps that might be taking place later in 2023. So maybe you could update us on what may have changed in terms of the timing in '24 and the 55% that you spoke about today. Sure, Mark. As we looked at the re-rating process within the plant, we really tried to optimize around the level of investment that would be required to increase that re-rate capacity. And as we've talked about in the past, desiring today to maintain the 150,000 units of installed capacity in Normal, but just slightly tweak that more towards the consumer side of the business today.
And so that was really the way that we calibrated around the trade-offs on how deeply we would have to disrupt the line or the level of downtime that would be required to make a more material increase in the production capacity of the R1 line as we thought about this re-rate process itself. So those are some of the core considerations that we went through as we evaluated the re-rate opportunity for us. And after we sort of go through this re-rate, we'll obviously think through additional opportunities to increase that potentially over time as well. That's helpful, Claire. And on the IRA, thanks for all the comments you made already so far. But in terms of demand from commercial customers, including for the delivery van, have you seen any change in terms of customer interest levels and when they may be able to or may be interested in taking vehicles? Thanks, Mark. I should have actually commented on that in the context of IRA. Just to be clear, the -- for commercial vehicles, the requirements of domestic cell production are much different. And so in the case of our commercial vans, they're applicable. And in the case of R1T for commercial applications, it's also applicable.
So we do see that, and we see that's something that certainly, some of the business owners that are buying R1Ts are leveraging. And then in the case of the commercial vans, this is something that we think is going to be very important. And we're seeing that as we talk to customers outside of Amazon, we see this as a very important enabler, and it helps ignite this large-scale transition of our commercial vehicle fleet towards electrification. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to RJ Scaringe for closing remarks. All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call, and thanks for the questions. As I said in my starting comments, we're really excited about what we see in front of us. 2022 was an important year for us. It was a critical year where we launched and ramped 3 different vehicles between the R1T, the R1S and the EDV platform.
And as we look into this year, more than doubling the overall output, but importantly, getting a lot of customers or a lot of vehicles into a lot of customers' hands. We'll start to see a lot more of these on the roads, whether that's the commercial vans or the consumer vehicles, the R1T and the R1S.
And as that ramp continues and as we start to see more and more of our vehicles on the road, as Claire and I both described, the core focus for us is driving cost down across the business. Some of that will happen naturally as volumes go up when we get the fixed cost leverage that Claire described in some detail, but that's also happening through the engineering changes we're making and this really heavy focus on the commercial relationship with all of our suppliers.
So with that, we're very excited about the year ahead and looking forward to getting a lot more vehicles on the road and our path towards profitability. Thank you, everyone.

Welcome to the Rivian’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s conference is being recorded.
I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian’s first quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management’s views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business, operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today’s shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we’ll cover on today’s call.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I would like to highlight key developments during the first quarter as well as discuss progress on our key value drivers. We had a strong start to the year as our team delivered on our targets, including continuing to ramp R1 production, integration of the Enduro motor and LFP battery packs and improved operating efficiency.
This quarter, I’ve asked Frank Klein, our Chief Operations Officer; and Nick Kalayjian, our Chief Product Development Officer, to join us for Q&A, given the importance of the launch and ramp of our Enduro motor platform.
Last week, our R1S was awarded the highest possible safety rating of TOP SAFETY PICK+ from IIHS, joining our R1T which earned the award earlier this year. This makes the R1S the only large SUV and the R1T the only electric pickup to achieve this rating in 2023.
During the first quarter, we produced 9,395 vehicles, which reflects continued quarter-over-quarter growth in R1 production. As of March 31, we’ve now produced nearly 35,000 vehicles since the start of production. Our team drove further improvement in the ramp of our consumer platform while successfully launching new technologies into our commercial ramp platform.
Production during the first quarter was in line with our expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our production outlook for the year of 50,000 total units. In addition to production, we made significant progress on our technology and product development road maps during the first quarter. As described during our last earnings call, we took the EDV line down for most of the first quarter to implement our in-house and our drive units as well as LFP battery packs.
Our Enduro production line is our first use our internally developed plant software platform designed to aid in the rapid bring up of equipment and our robotics. This platform offers greater control over our equipment and visibility into thousands of data points across all parts of the manufacturing process.
Enduro’s providing cost improvements that will result in a significant reduction in our bill of materials. We expect to start implementing the Enduro motor into our R1 vehicles as a dual motor configuration during the second quarter of 2023, which will contribute to expanding our addressable market by enabling lower-priced future R1 variants.
As a reference, the introduction of the Enduro and LFP battery pack in EDV enabled us to reduce the EDV bill of materials by approximately 25%. Our core priorities for 2023 are unchanged. The team remains focused on ramping production for our R1 and RCV platforms, driving cost reductions, developing the R2 platform and future technologies and delivering an outstanding end-to-end customer experience.
Growing production volume improves fixed cost leverage at our large-scale manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. This is crucial to realizing the long-term structural cost advantages of our vertically integrated strategy and represents the primary lever on our path to sell each vehicle profitably. While challenges remain, we’ve become a stronger, more agile company through this process.
The duration and magnitude of our impact is directly linked to our ability to produce vehicles profitably. We have a strong sense of urgency in achieving this goal, driving lower costs will be enabled by integration of new technologies such as Enduro and LFP battery packs as well as our company-wide program designed to maximize efficiency across key cost elements of material costs, logistics, labored overhead, indirect costs and capital expenditures.
Beyond our push to drive operational efficiency, innovation that’s deliver both improved performance and range as well as simplified production, our core focus of our development teams. Much of the work we are doing in R1, including Enduro drive units simplified network architecture and updated sensor set and compute directly translates to our R2 platform. We are utilizing R1 to help capture and drive earnings to ensure a smooth ramp of R2. This alignment of technical road maps between R1 and R2 will help further drive long-term cost efficiencies.
Finally, we continue to progress the purchase process and service experience. This year, we expect to grow our physical go-to-market infrastructure, including our mobile and physical service footprint, charging through our Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian spaces. Further, we plan to increase engagement with our preorder customers and drive additional demand by expanding our demo drive program, offering more opportunities for potential customers to experience Rivian vehicle.
Overall, the progress we’re making against our core value drivers of ramping production, driving costs down, developing new technologies and platforms and enhancing customer experience positions us well to continue executing on our goals for the remainder of the year as well as into 2024.
With that, I’ll pass the call over to Claire for more details on our financial and operating performance for Q1. Thanks, RJ. The team’s achievements during Q1 established an important base of new technologies that will benefit Rivian for quarters to come through greater material cost reduction, enhanced range efficiency and access to additional market segments. Technologies such as Enduro and LFP are critical to achieve our long-term target cost structure across current vehicle platforms as well as R2.
Turning to our first quarter results. We produced 9,395 vehicles and delivered 7,946 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $661 million of revenue we generated. During 2022, we took measures to drive greater efficiency, which remains our focus for 2023. Compared to our fourth quarter of 2022, Q1 gross profit per delivered vehicle improved 46%.
Cash SG&A expenses were relative flat, while cash R&D increased slightly, primarily due to restructuring expenses. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $535 million, which was impacted by a net charge for LCNRV write-downs on inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments. The cumulative inventory write-downs and losses on firm purchase commitments of $822 million is comprised of $561 million of write-downs related to inventory on hand and $261 million of losses on firm purchase commitments.
Given we are now in a new fiscal year, the LCNRV charge of $229 million, you will see on our statement of cash flows is reflected of the charge on new inventory purchased and firm purchase commitments entered into in Q1. The cumulative LCNRV and firm purchase commitments of $822 million represents a $98 million decrease versus the prior quarter due primarily to significant reductions in material costs for the EDV and an increase in average selling price for our R1 vehicles.
As the cumulative LCNRV inventory write-down decreases, we expect to see an increase in net inventory balances and over time, a net decrease in cost of goods sold per vehicle. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in 2024 and therefore, expects by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges and losses on firm purchase commitments associated with our production at our Normal plant.
Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 fell to $898 million, as compared to $1.1 billion in the same period last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating expenses was related to decreases in stock-based compensation. We continue to prioritize investments in our core and vehicle technologies and customer experience while also driving additional focus and cost optimization across the business.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023 was negative $1.1 billion as compared to negative $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $283 million in Q1 of 2023 as compared to $418 million during the same period last year. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $11.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Importantly, during the quarter, we took steps to reinforce our robust liquidity position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a key priority. It provides a buffer during volatile industry conditions and mitigates risk while scaling significant growth capital projects. It also allows us to focus on delivering against our long-term growth plans, including the path to positive gross profit in 2024 as well as the launch of our R2.
During the first quarter of 2023, we issued green convertible senior notes due in 2029, which generated proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion. In mid-April, we announced an amendment to our asset-based revolving credit facility, which doubles the available revolving commitments to $1.5 billion extends the maturity to 2028, improved borrowing availability by more efficient lending on some current assets and increases our permitted indebtedness provisions to expand debt capacity.
In aggregate, these transactions have increased Rivian’s liquidity profile by over $2.4 billion, provide debt maturity beyond the launch of R2 and are reflective of our diversified approach to funding the business. We remain confident that our cash can fund operations through 2025 and believe with these recent additions, we have strengthened our balance sheet as we approach the launch of R2 in 2026.
I also want to take this opportunity to reiterate our gross profit bridge from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. We continue to target positive gross profit in 2024. Excluding the impact of LCNRV and firm purchase commitments, we expect approximately half of the improvement will be driven by greater volume and utilization of our installed capacity.
Our 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units implies a doubling of capacity utilization, which will result in significantly lower fixed cost per vehicle, and we expect production volumes to increase further in 2024. The remaining half is split between increases in average selling prices and material cost reduction.
Lower material costs will be enabled by the integration of new technologies such as Enduro and LFP battery packs, which delivered about a 25% material cost reduction for our commercial vehicles in Q1 versus Q4. In addition to the engineering design-driven cost reductions we also expect to realize commercial cost savings as we negotiate with our suppliers.
The increase in average selling prices is based upon the gradual improvements we expect to achieve as we complete the fulfillment of our pre-March 2022 preorder base as well as the introduction of new technologies that produced improved performance and capabilities. While gross margin is expected to remain negative in 2023, Q1 represented significant progress versus Q4 2022 with gross profit loss per delivered vehicle nearly cut in half.
This was due to cost of goods sold improvements and higher average selling prices. During the first quarter of 2023, cost of goods sold benefited from lower LCNRV, freight and material costs versus Q4 2022. While performance for any particular quarter may vary, we expect these trends to persist throughout 2023.
We are reaffirming all aspects of our 2023 guidance. Most notably, we are reaffirming 2023 total vehicle production of 50,000 units and 2023 EBITDA guidance of negative $4.3 billion, which represents an improvement of $900 million versus 2022. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will be $2 billion.
In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to open the line up for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now first question coming from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. Good afternoon guys. Just wanted to ask a first question on pricing. I mean, RJ, sort of your entire strategy, you’ve kind of looked at the lifetime revenue opportunity of the vehicle and really thought about that in a holistic way. And I think I have a pretty good view of that. There are some folks that are taking that view and saying, ""Hey, listen, I can cut my upfront price on the vehicle and not make that much money on it and make up the profitability on the back end from that lifetime revenue and profit opportunity.
I’m just curious, as you think about the company and the strategy and the philosophy of running it if you would ever think of embracing something like that, and then maybe as a sort of a second part of that question, you’re talking about raising pricing. So you’re kind of going in the opposite direction. How should we think about the cadence of the roll-off of the pre-March 2022 preorders that had the price protection? Thanks, John. It’s – these are, I think, really relevant questions here for us as we think about the pricing of vehicles. In the case of R1, this is our flagship product. So from a flagship product point of view, we’ve introduced with what we call a large pack and with our quad motor. And over the course over the next several months, we’re going to be launching our Max pack, which introduces a higher price variances R1, and it will also be introducing our Enduro motor with Enduro drive unit, which introduces our entry configuration.
And so we’re both going to be growing pricing on some variants, but also offering some of our lower price variants at the same time. And for us, really important with that is giving customers and we see this for the data, giving customers what they’re looking for. And a significant portion of our customers are looking for the best of the best when it comes to R1 platform in terms of wanting to get the maximum range and maximum performance. And so we are really looking forward to getting the Max pack out there, and that will contribute to growing ASP.
But as you said, the other element is the growth in post-March 1 orders or as Claire noted, the pre-March first orders have a lower price and as we start to come off of those orders and into newer orders, that’s going to naturally start to shift pricing up, we’re already seeing that in Q1 of this year. So those two together give us a lot of confidence in ASP growing over time for the R1 platform.
Now more broadly as we think about the business in terms of revenue opportunities beyond the initial sale. This is something we also believe strongly and it’s driving a lot of the investment we’re making into our technology platforms, of course, around not only our full software stack, but importantly, and what we’re building with autonomy. And as I noted in my opening comments, a lot of work is underway right now in our next-generation platform for new sensor set, updated sensors, I should say, as well as updated compute, which will allow us, as we look at future variants and future products to really over deliver when it comes to the Level 2, Level 3 self-driving feature set and enable our ability to monetize as well.
So that we certainly see as part of the business in the long term. And above and beyond self-driving, there are other opportunities to create meaningful recurring revenue. And some of those, we’ve started to launch and initiated already with our insurance product, with some of the financing products that we have. So we do see the business, as you pointed out, very holistically across the life cycle of the products. Just to follow-up, RJ, you would never cut price on the front end to drive the hardware sale to get the profit back over time on sort of the software and services side over time. You believe you need to earn adequate margins and returns on the front end, even though you have this opportunity in the back end. Is that a fair statement? For us with the R1 platform, this – our strategy isn’t to – certainly have been to do that. But longer term, as the business evolves, we’ve – and I’m sure we’ll talk about this today in the Q&A portion. We’re putting a tremendous amount of focus on driving cost efficiencies into our R2 platform. That’s how the vehicle is architected. That’s how we’re looking at part consolidation. It’s how we’re thinking about everything from network architecture to easy [ph] topology across the vehicle to drive cost efficiencies to facilitate obviously, a much lower-priced vehicle, but also to give us flexibility in the long-term to look at different revenue streams and different revenue opportunities.
But as it stands on R1, as I reiterate at the start, we do see ASP continuing to expand and grow both because of – we’re pulling a new post-March 1 customers as well as the expanded number of offerings that bring in things like Max pack and certainly, we will be continuing to the feature set to allow us to fully access customer demand. Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up here on the virtual factory technologies that you used for the Enduro motor launch. Can you just kind of explain what that actually means? And how you can use that in the future and how much that saves you in the launch process as far as time and money? Yes, this is an important development. Our team has been working hard in its Enduro represents for us really the sort of a full embodiment of what we believe we’re capable of in terms of both product engineering as well as our manufacturing engineering teams and the close integration between those teams led to a lot of innovations, which we’ve talked about in previous calls, in terms of part consolidation and part – or overall design simplification. But what’s not necessarily seen in the product is how we’re manufacturing it and the bring up of this line has gone very smoothly. It’s ahead of schedule. We’re actually ahead of our ramp curve, which is a great thing.
But a lot of that’s been facilitated by really careful planning from the teams, but also what I referred to in the opening comments, we’ve developed a platform that allows us to very seamlessly bring up all the PLCs, all the controllers and all the robotics and the equipment associated with that much more seamlessly by creating effectively an extraction layer that we control from a plant software point of view. And we can access equipment much more seamlessly and we can bring up the equipment much more seamlessly than when we’re working through a variety of third-party platforms to do those things. Very interesting. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hey everybody. So my first question is for Frank. You’re coming up on one year at the company as COO. When you think about the next 12 months, where do you see the greatest opportunity to improve efficiency at Normal? And what would you point out as the greatest risk to execution from here? Thanks, Frank. Yes. Thanks, Adam, for the question. I mean my priority, certainly for the next 12 month is to continue focusing on the ramp-up in Normal, certainly driving down the cost, as RJ and Claire already mentioned, and certainly also already preparing the ramp-up of our R2 platform. And this is, I think, will give us a competitive advantage as we are already as a team, jointly together with Nick working on the next generation R2 and really preparing that. And you’ve seen we’ve already, in the last few months shown that we are in line with the expectation on the Q1 production numbers, and we really anticipate continuing the ramp-up of the R1 line. And we will really see in the second half of this year that we should see the numbers being really close to our installed capacity.
Again, on the cost initiative, yes, I mean we still see a significant gap on what we should be paying our suppliers and what we’re currently paying. So what we have done in the last few months is starting to engage the discussions with every single supplier and to show them the gap, and we’re working on closing the gap within the next few months. So this is really my priority, I think we have a great plan in place. So right now, for me, it’s literally just executing the plan that we put together as a team. Thanks, Frank. And RJ, just a follow-up for you. Now that you’ve been released some exclusivity on the EDV. Are you able to provide any update on status of discussions with other commercial customers at a high level in the last few months? Thanks. Thanks, Adam. We’re, at this point, continue to focus from a production point of view on really the single customer with Amazon. And in terms of looking beyond the exclusivity into other customers, we do see a broad set of needs in the commercial space. And as you all know, these are long lead time discussions and negotiations, especially for some of these larger contracts. So those have been underway for some time now, and certainly play into the long-term plan for the platform, and it’s been something we’ve been working very closely with Amazon on to allow us to pursue these other customers as quickly as possible. Thanks, RJ. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line George Gianarikas with Canaccord. Your line is open. Hey good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit with a little more granularity, some of the leverage you could have to EV commodity prices coming in, you’d mentioned in the past that your contracts from 2018, 2019 are expiring. Any additional color would be greatly appreciated. This is important. Frank referenced it a bit in his previous comment, but a lot of our – the vast majority of our bill of materials from when we started production, were negotiated in contracts in the 2018, 2019 time frame. So that was a few years before we started production. Certainly, we didn’t have the negotiating leverage that we have today. And as we wind the clock forward through to today, the level of excitement and engagement that we have from suppliers is – it’s absolutely night and day. So there’s a tremendous amount of passion to drive towards – help us drive towards profitability.
Really, as the suppliers see us as a significant partner going forward and are excited not just about R1, but are certainly very excited about the R2 platform as well. So as Frank talked about, these are negotiations that are happening real time, and we’re working closely with our partners to find appropriate cost down paths to achieve our targets and to achieve the long-term profitability on R1 but also to set up the relationships to be profitable very rapidly in R2. As a follow-up, asking for Frank, any curious on timing for the Max pack durations [ph] for the R1 platform? Thanks. Yes. My dad has been asking me that a lot lately, too. So I think there’s a tremendous amount of excitement for the Max pack and we are working very hard to bring that forward. I think as I noted at the beginning, it certainly also helps us grow ASPs. So there’s a lot of reasons in addition to your friend and my satisfaction of pulling Max pack in as quickly as possible. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi everybody. I know that you are not talking about backlog anymore on the consumer side, but I was hoping, RJ, you might be able to just give us some color, first of all, on what you’re seeing in terms of demand trends on that side of the business? Sure. Thanks, Rod. Well, backlog still extends well into 2024. I think important to note here is just the engagement we have with customers and the level of satisfaction that our early customers the first 35,000 or so customers are having really creates a powerful flywheel where our biggest, and I would say, most important advocates are the buyers of our vehicles.
And so with that said, we continue to see that through the online forms. We see that through the communities that are performing and we even see that through third-party recognition. J.D. Power had is awarded with the highest level of customer satisfaction of any vehicle in the 2023 ratings, which was great, and it’s really reflective of the brand. We’re working so hard to build, but also the experiences we’re trying to create across the full life cycle of the ownership experience.
Now with that said, the work that we’re going to continue to do over the course of this year will – and I noted this earlier, will help us expand brand visibility and brand awareness. So the additional physical spaces that we’re building out, the sales infrastructure or service infrastructure that we’re building out will continue to contribute to that, that growing flywheel of awareness and growing flywheel of demand. Great. Thanks for that. And Claire, I want to make sure that we’re thinking about the underlying gross profit ex LCNRV impact correctly? Because I think that we’re seeing some signs of improvement here even with the downtime that you took and before – probably before the impact of this the 25% decline in BOM [ph] on the RCV. In the past, you’ve suggested that we look at the difference in the LCNRV charge, so that would be $98 million this quarter. So broad strokes, would you say that on the gross profit line and a clean run rate was a bit over $600 million loss on 8,000 units delivered versus $760 million or so on kind of similar delivery volume last quarter. And is that the run rate from which you’re bridging to breakeven? Or you talked you were referring to the full year guidance? Rod, that’s correct. That’s the run rate that we’re working on. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the Q1 walk from current Q1 gross profit, excluding the impact of LCNRV to where we expect to be in Q4 of 2024. And as you rightfully noted, we saw a 17% improvement quarter-over-quarter as we went from Q4 to Q1. Okay. So it sounds like you’re confirming that. And is your bridge – are you sort of holding commodities somewhat flat in your guidance bridge? Or how do you sort of think about as we’re seeing lithium carbonate hydroxide costs falling? What – how are you sort of factoring that into your bridges at this point? Sure. The way I would characterize it is within the forecast guide to that Q4 2024, the expectations are for more of a normalized state of commodity costs. So we – said another way, we haven’t expected material reductions in commodity costs, even though we, in the course of the last quarter, have seen significant declines in the cost of lithium carbonate. – in lithium hydroxide as well. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Great. Thanks guys. So my first question is on the 25% reduction in the bill of materials as a result of the LFP pack and Enduro, which I think is an interesting data point. You expect something similar when you start rolling those technologies out with R1? And if that comes alongside a price hike, it seems like the impact on gross margin could be pretty material. I just don’t know if it has such a big impact on the bill of materials for R1 as well. Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. As Claire noted, we’re excited to see the 25% reduction that we referenced starts to make its way into the numbers in Q2 as the EDV line comes back on, and we’ll see those numbers in Q2. But for R1, this is a really important development. It’s part of a broader set of developments that when we talk about a lot of the R&D work on the innovation that we’re driving a big portion of this is focused on driving cost out, driving simplification of the product and I’d like to invite Nick just to talk a bit about some of the work that we’re doing there, inclusive of Enduro, but there’s a host of other work streams that we’re going to start to see come to light. Yes. Thanks, RJ. So the Enduro drive unit is a significantly less expensive product and diversifies our supply chain, which brings additional value. When we think about the EDV experience that we’ve been able to deliver on over the last quarter with the ramp of Enduro and the integration of LFP. And that 25% reduction is really impactful, and we expect to see something similar in R1 as we look over the next couple of quarters in the beginning of next year. Okay. Great. Second question on CapEx. I saw that you maintained the $2 billion guidance, but that’s a pretty – that implies, I guess, a pretty material step up versus what you spent in Q1. So just wondering maybe qualitatively and/or quantitatively, if you can talk through what that money is earmarked for in the back half? And if there’s any potential to maybe defer some of that in order to protect the cash balance? Thanks. Sure, Alex. As we think about the cadence of our CapEx, as you can imagine, with the $2 billion guide that we have, that implies significantly higher levels of CapEx over the remaining three quarters of the year. And for us, our expectation is, we’re going to make significant investments, predominantly in tooling as we think about some of the next-generation technologies that will start to be introduced throughout the course of 2023. And then importantly, as we’ve talked about in prior earnings calls before – throughout the course of 2024 as well.
And so I would say that’s one of the primary drivers of our CapEx spend. Beyond that, there’s incremental payments associated with the commissioning and utilization of our Enduro line, where we have the lines fully running today, but all of that cash is not yet out the door at Rivian. And then beyond that, as RJ alluded to continued build-out of our go-to-market infrastructure as we’re building out incremental service centers, charging network, things of that nature as we continue to grow and scale the business in aggregate.
Based off of your second part of your question on availability to defer CapEx, given the sort of lumpy nature of our CapEx deployment and spend, there certainly is some likelihood especially as we think about some of the Georgia CapEx initiation that some of that could fall into 2024 relative to 2023. Perfect. Thanks guys. Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. First I want to ask about the constraints that Normal. In the past, I think you said the largest constraint on production was on power semi. So just want to get a sense of where that stands. And we’ve heard about tightness on silicon carbide, I know you used both silicon carbide and IGBT, but how much is the tight silicon carbide supply still a challenge for you? Thanks, Dan. One of the things we’ve sort of embedded in our comments here and that we should add some more color to is with the bring up of the Enduro drive unit, it doesn’t – it’s not only providing us with a lower-cost propulsion platform, but it also helps us diversify our supply chain with regards to the power modules. So bringing on additional suppliers of both silicon IGBT, but also silicon carbide and that was very intentional. And we’ve designed the ramp-up of that such that it helps alleviate some of the constraints we have on our existing quad motor silicon carbide supply, which we’ve talked about in the past as being one of the major ramp constraints.
This is also something that as we look forward into R2, we’re spending a lot of time on to make sure that these constraints aren’t there. And Nick’s team in designing our next-generation inverters and power modules have spent a tremendous amount of effort to ensure that we really consider some of the long-term constraints that we see in this space. I think the comments earlier about when we sourced a lot of the components for R1 are really relevant in power semis as well. The supply base for our original launch configuration was a relatively smaller set of players than who we’re working with today for both silicon and silicon carbide. And as we move into Enduro and we move into those larger, more mature suppliers, we build out that capacity today, and we build those relationships towards the future as we think about our R2. So is it fair to say that as you’re sort of addressing the silicon carbide issue in a variety of ways and then as this is addressed, your patent production should increase dramatically, which is implied, I think, within your guidance in any case? Yes, that’s right. Okay. Great. Thank you. Second question, and I think you’ve addressed this somewhat with Enduro and LFP, but wondering what other opportunities you have with vehicle to potentially de-content further or to help reduce the material costs? I know you’ve talked about working with suppliers to try to cut away some of the costs. But within the engineering of R1 itself, what other opportunities might there be to de-content to help improve the path to breakeven? Yes. So Enduro and LFP are clearly big pieces of the puzzle. And I think we tend to talk about those because they’re customer-facing. We’re offering different range packs and drift and driving configurations. There’s a lot of work that’s also going on under the covers to make sure that we have continued cost reduction. RJ has talked in the past about moving to a zonal architecture, which really has a significant impact on the number of ECUs in the vehicle. The complexity and cost of the harness. And those both have significant impacts with Frank in the factory on our ability to reduce labor content in the vehicles.
We also are looking at a series of body manufacturing updates late this year, updates to joining technology and materials to help improve yield and lower cost. We have a new part of the Max pack and the Large pack platform coming early next year that involves some significant changes to the battery structure that really pull out costs and again drive up manufacturability. So again, some of these are really customer-facing things, but – our goal is to offer better value to customers. And then some of these things like the zonal architecture are success means nobody notices that we’ve made all these changes under the hood. I think the other thing just to note, Nick referred to and I referred to it, the updates we’re making to our network architecture really laid the groundwork for what we’re doing with R2. And one of the benefits of developing the – all the electronics in the vehicle and of course, the software stack in the vehicles. As we’ve now reached a level of maturity, we’re consolidating a number of those ECUs and removing not only a lot of these use from the vehicle while maintaining feature set, but also along with that, massively simplifying the vehicle harness. And all that work flows very naturally into R2, so we not only pay costs out of R1, but we derisk the launch of R2. Great. So number of [indiscernible] that. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group. Your line is open. Yes. Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On the Enduro dual-motor, Enduro and the LFP, what mix are you assuming of your shipments or deliveries will be on those as you ramp those to the year or? In the case of our commercial vans, 100% of the commercial vans are moving to LFP pack configuration and the Enduro drive unit. As it pertains to the R1 platform, we expect a drive train level between what we call our origin, the quad motor and Enduro, the dual-motor to be about a 50-50 split. We have the flexibility within our production capabilities to flex that up or down some. But as you heard from myself and Frank earlier, the supply chain constraints around the power semi is really a key consideration and that flexibility of our production lines to respond to any supply constraints that may come up is really important. Now in the case of our R1 battery pack, we will be introducing what we call our standard pack, but that’s going to be a little later than this year. Got it. And on the – you mentioned the higher ASP sales. Just wondering how that is ramping. Is all your deliveries post-March 31st to April 1st on the hire ASP vehicles or... Yes. The pre-March first vehicles have a lower price point. And we’re actively with every vehicle we deliver of those, we – it’s one less, and we start to work towards a growing mix of post-March 1 reservations and progress [ph]. So over the course of really the next year, we hope to work through those pre-March 1st quarters and get into newer post March 1, 2022 orders. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Hi, yes. Thanks for the taking the question. And apologies if you answered this, just a quick question on the guidance, the EBITDA guidance. If I take the Q1 adjusted EBITDA and annualize it, I get a number that’s only, I think, 6% below your full year guide. I know deliveries should probably ramp higher and you have these cost outs. Just curious as to maybe is there a quarterly cadence dynamic that’s leading to that EBITDA guidance for the full year? Sure, Tom. As we think about the overall EBITDA cadence overall, it’s driven by a couple of key factors. First and foremost, while we’ll be improving our overall cost of goods sold per unit, we are still running at a loss position throughout the course of 2023. And so as we go throughout the course of the year this year, we’ll see some variability, both in terms of how rapidly we’re taking down the LCNRV charges throughout the course of the year, which is one factor as it pertains to our adjusted EBITDA that we’ll be reporting.
And then the other factor that we’ll have as well is really as we think about sort of the three key drivers as ramp material costs at ASP and the trajectory that we expect to see as we continuously improve on each of those core drivers as the year progresses on, but we’ll be delivering greater volumes of vehicles albeit at lower loss positions as we continue to scale throughout the year. Okay. And just kind of a high-level question. wondering for RJ, wondering how you think about the kind of long-term market opportunity for your consumer offering in light of what appears to be maybe increasing competition from legacy OEMs particularly in trucks and SUVs. Does that change kind of how you view the market opportunity longer term? Or do you view it as kind of different kind of world. Certainly, these legacy OEMs are getting more competitive with – specifically with EVs across these vehicles? Yes. Thanks, Tom. Yes, today, with the R1 product, we’re seeing demand relative to others that are in similar segments or similar price points, it’s significantly outpacing sort of similarly priced vehicles. So at this price point, the R1 platforms, really the leader in terms of overall share. And that level of excitement and demand that we’re seeing there is reflective of the way we’ve approached the brand and the features and the overall product design. And of course, we hope to carry that into much lower price point with the R2 platform. And the R2 platform, while it we’ll have a number of other players that are offering products that are in that price range of $40,000 to $50,000.
The way we’re thinking about it and the things we’re excited about with regards to the product is just how unique we can make it in terms of capturing the core essence of everything we’ve shown with the flagship product with a product that ultimately delivers on a high level of performance, both on and off road, a tremendous amount of capability and the ability to sort of enable and inspire folks to take the kinds of ventures where you need to fit your pets, your kids your gear into the vehicle.
So we, of course, haven’t shown R2 yet. We’ve all seen it. So we’re – we have asymmetric information on what it looks like and what it is. But I can say we have a tremendous amount of confidence around the product we’re developing and how that not only fits our brand so nicely, but we think really provides an extension to the addressable market relative to what we’ve done with R1. Yes. I think quarter sorry, it’s important as well to extend the vision of what we’re doing well beyond the electric powertrain. Legacy OEMs are moving in this direction, which is great for the overall mission. But we really do focus on that overall customer experience and what we can deliver with a combined hardware, software platform.
The fact that we’ve been shipping a product for less than two years and influencer like Marcus Brown, he would say best SUV in the world. We have a software experience and overall customer experience that we’re really proud of, and we think differentiates beyond just being an electric vehicle. Yes. I guess, relative today, we haven’t really seen what the legacy OEMs have done yet, right? I mean a lot of these launches are still yet to come. 2024, specifically, we’re going to see a couple more – and then obviously, as we get further in the decade, that’s what I was referring to. I mean today, obviously, it’s not as robust, especially in the U.S., but in the coming years, you – I would think that competition intensifies more. That’s kind of what I was referring to. I think the other thing to keep in mind and Nick references, is in the not-too-distant future, everything will be electric. So being electric alone isn’t a sufficient differentiation point. It really ties into the – ultimately what’s the way the product comes together, the interplay between software, the electronics in the vehicle, of course, the dynamic performance of the vehicle, the packaging and the architecture of the vehicle. And Frank referred to and I referred to it, but how manufacturable the vehicle, which ultimately drives the cost structure for what we’re building.
So given the significant change in the electrication offers, though, it does create new opportunities in terms of how we architect the vehicle, how we design the cost structure and then the types of driving dynamics and experiences that can be delivered. All right. Great. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Jim, your line is open. I think the reception cut out for me. Can you hear me? Yes. We can. Yes. Okay. I think this was asked, but I just want to clarify, given the 25% bond savings, it will be meaningful – as we think about next year, what could the mix of your total R1 production be tied to LFP and Enduro, I imagine you have some visibility into that based on your reservations. And – can you just remind us if there’s going to be an impact to the lines as you integrate into on LFP and into R1 similar to what we saw for EDV this past quarter? Thanks. As I referenced, we expect from an Enduro, so the dual motor versus the quad motor on our one to be roughly a 50-50 split. And in the case of commercial vans, 100% of those will be with the Enduro Drive unit. In terms of how we plan to ramp up R1 with Enduro, it’s important to note that while we brought the EDV line down in Q1 for the integration of both Enduro and the LFP was also we were bringing up the Enduro line and the significant cost savings that, that propulsion package delivered really led us to make the decision to bring on EDV while we brought those lines up and ramped them.
I’d like to just invite Frank to have a few comments on the ramp of Enduro and how that now will soon be feeding R1 as well as EDV and I referenced this before, but a big part of it beyond just plant software, beyond the equipment, beyond the design of the product is also the operations and the team and how the team is working and how we’ve set up training and the programs around that. Yes. Thanks, RJ. I mean, the Enduro ramp-up, we started production at the beginning of February and we’re already exceeding our anticipated ramp-up curve. So from ramping up the Enduro, I don’t see significant challenges ahead of us. And the differentiating factor between introducing EDV, the Enduro into the EDV versus R1 is that on the EDV, we did shut down the line. And on R1, we plan on continuing producing the R1 while we are introducing the Enduro motors into the R1 product.
We’ve already actually built several Enduro Motors into the R1, just to really test the production, and it really works seamlessly. So I don’t see a major impact on the ramp-up curve of the R1 as we introduce Enduro as a significant change to the R1 product. Yes. As Frank said, the one – the Enduro has been we’ve introduced – we’ve produced quite a few, and we’re bleeding or blending those into the line for R1. I can I’ve been driving an Enduro, R1S now for the past month, and it’s really incredible. I can’t wait for customers to get their hands on it. So as Frank said, the risk around the Enduro bring up in R1 is really well managed and we’ve been very intentional around how we’ve ramped that line and how we plan the integration of Enduro into R1. And we have really put a lot of emphasis in preparing the team and training the team offline and online to make sure that the team is capable and ready to ramp up our one with the Enduro motor as well. Got it. That’s super helpful. And then just two quick ones. Is the first half of next year, still the time frame for normal capacity re-rating to the R1 and then is there any update on the Georgia plant incentives outcome? Thank you. Yes, on the first question, yes, that is the plan. We plan on re-rating there R1 line in 2024 as we also use that opportunity to modify the line to incorporate the technical changes that Nick mentioned. So this will happen in 2024. So we’re already in preparation of this on the one hand, with the equipment suppliers preparing the team. So that’s going according to plan. And then on your second question on Georgia-related incentives. A couple of weeks ago, the Georgia all it court sided with the state in a ruling over the tax abatement for the project and ruled in favor of the state’s position. So the tax fund four of the five aspects of the appeal, the court ruled in favor of Georgia and therefore, Rivian’s benefit as part of that ruling overall. So great momentum as we sit here today on progress in Georgia. Understood. Thank you. Congrats. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist. Your line is now open. Jordan Levy, your line is open. Apologies my cut off for a second. I’m wondering just quickly if we could talk about the build-out of the adventure network and the importance of growing that and any potential benefits that might be able to be realized from the IRA as you build that out? Yes. Thanks, Jordan. We’re excited about building out more of our RAN network or Rivian Adventure Network. And today, we’ve been deploying into what we think it was like the first batch of sites to really ensure the uptime ensure the equipment is working as planned.
And just as reference, this is the charging increment, the DC fast chargers. We’ve designed those internally, we also build those in normal. So we have a production line dedicated to building those charters. We’re going through making some updates to the product as well to facilitate it becoming an open network.
And Nick, this is something your team is working really hard on. We just had a review on it last week. It’s – I couldn’t be more excited about getting more of these out there. Can you just provide some more commentary on some of the work that you’re doing there? Yes, sure. So just to put some numbers behind it, we have 27 sites open today, which represents about 150 chargers in locations across the country. We’ve picked these to be sort of relevant to our customer base as we think about routes from places like the Bay Area Tahoe or LA up to Mammoth. Those units as already referenced, are showing really strong uptime and that’s really the key. The customer feedback about the overall user experience has been excellent.
The number one complaint is why aren’t there more of them. So that’s what we’re working hard to accomplish, but we really want to scale that based on solid data that we have, the uptime that we’re going to have a dependable network. And then we expect later this year, we’ll be able to accelerate the number of installs and then again, continue that some minor modifications to the equipment to be able to open the network up beyond Rivian customers. And we look forward to be in a position to take advantage of that money funding, there’s $5 billion of net funding available. And then in addition to that, the charging and fueling infrastructure program, which has an incremental $2.5 billion available. So we’re excited to use some of those government grants to accelerate our rollout of the RAN network. And we’re uniquely positioned because U.S. produce chargers at our Normal facility. Thanks so much. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe for any closing remarks. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We enjoyed talking about some of the progress we made in the last quarter. We’re certainly, as you heard from all of us, very much looking forward to the quarters and years ahead.
We have a lot of work to do in terms of continuing to drive our production ramp and drive costs down. We’re operating with an incredible level of focus and urgency as we drive towards that. But the excitement that we’re seeing from customers and the passion that we’re seeing from customers that want to get future products is certainly innovating force for all of us within Rivian. And we’re looking forward to continuing to show progress quarter-over-quarter as we work towards not all profitability, but significantly higher volumes. So thank you, everyone for joining and look forward to the next call. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has provided in our shareholder letter . this quarter, we’ve asked Frank Klein, our Chief Operations Officer, and Nick Kalayjian, our chief product development officer, to join us for Q&A . last week, our R1S was awarded the highest possible safety rating of TOP SAFETY PICK+ from IIHS .",1.0

Welcome to Rivian's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to Tim Bei, Vice President of Strategic Financial and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Rivian's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management's views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ, who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments during the second quarter and provide an update on the progress we're making against our core value drivers. Production continues to ramp, which is translating into improved profitability and capital efficiency.
We are also driving material cost reductions through commercial and engineering design updates, including the integration of our in-house dual motor into the R1 product line. We remain focused on the customer experience as we expand our physical, digital and mobile footprint and took important steps during the quarter to improve our charging experience.
Importantly, prior to getting into the quarter's details, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders for their continued support of our vision. Consistent with our last earnings call, Claire and I will be inviting different leaders to join us each quarter. For this call, I've asked Wassym Bensaid, our Senior Vice President of Software Development to join given the critical role software plays in enabling our business and the ever improving and expanding capabilities and features of our vehicles.
During the second quarter, we produced 13,992 vehicles, which represents a 50% increase compared to the first quarter. Importantly, approximately 70% of the R1 units produced during the second quarter were R1S vehicles. This represents the first time R1S quarterly production was higher than R1T production. Our team in Irvine has made strong progress during the first half of the year, maturing the manufacturing process of the R1S to the point where the build efficiency is essentially equal to the R1T. It's also important to note the R1S is more profitable than the R1T.
The ramp of our in-house Enduro Motor line remains a key enabler to near-term production performance. Due to our progress during the first half of the year, we are increasing our 2023 production guidance to 52,000 total units. Building on the successful launch of the in-house Enduro Motors for our commercial vans last quarter, we successfully integrated this motor into the dual motor variant of the R1 platform during the second quarter. This is an important milestone from a cost perspective and we'll also be instrumental in expanding the consumer market opportunity for R1 vehicles.
We believe the majority of our long-term R1 demand will come from dual-motor variants. These variants have pricing that starts at just over $70,000, extend up to 400 miles of range, reach 0 to 60 mph in as quick as 3.5 seconds, torque to 11,000 pounds and generate over 800 foot pounds of torque and 650 horsepower. We believe the dual-motor variants offer great value while providing high on and off road performance.
The technology and clean sheet approach we've taken with the R1 product line has really enabled the uniquely differentiated product, the features, the attributes, the way the vehicle feels so special. And this is the result of thousands and thousands of tradeoffs we're making between different pieces of content, the way we think about design, the way we think about technology integrating with that design.
And of course the R1 product line was intended and is our handshake with the world. It's our flagship product. And so as we've now been thinking a lot about how does that brand position that we've created for a product point of view integrate across the mosaic of all the other touch points we have as a company. And then of course into R2 those same, that same mindset and that same ethos is being applied of course in a smaller form factor and a lower price point.
And having spent a lot of time with the teams and closely coordinating all these different trade-offs and sort of thinking about how does Rivian manifest at this lower price point with a smaller form factor, I can say we couldn't possibly more be more excited about what's to come with R2 and really looking forward to showing our product in the early part of 2024. It represents in much the same way that R1 rethought a segment, rethought a space, R2 takes that even further and stretches our ideology and our brand ethos really into such a great segment and such a large addressable market.
Now on to our second quarter results, which reflect our continued extreme focus on cost efficiency as we accelerate our drive towards profitability. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, delivered vehicles grew by 60%, while gross profit per vehicle improved by about $35,000. We achieved meaningful reductions in both R1 and EDV vehicle unit costs across the key components, including material costs, manufacturing, labor, overhead, and logistics. Maintaining our cost reduction efforts through consistent focus and collaboration across all levels of the company is a core part of the culture we're building.
I also want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the progress we're making from our partnership with Amazon. When designing the electric delivery van, we set out to develop a delivery van which offers a step change in safety, innovation, technology and of course, driver comfort. As of early July, there are EDVs in operation across over 800 cities in the United States. In addition, we recently initiated deliveries of EDVs to Amazon in Europe. It was a strong quarter and we remained focused on ramping production, driving cost efficiencies, developing future technologies and creating an amazing customer experience.
With that, I'll pass the call to Wassym to discuss our software development strategy. Thank you, RJ. It's good to be here to discuss our software capabilities and the progress we are making. The impact of software is pervasive throughout the company. The most obvious and customer facing aspects of our software is what customers see and experience through their in vehicle digital experience, our over the air updates and the Rivian mobile app. Our priority here is to take feedback from our customers and enhance the customer experience, whether that's through dry modes, comfort features, range efficiency or addressing other pain points that customers may experience.
Over here I have actually been called the Chief Reddit Officer given my interaction with customers on the Rivian subreddit. Since launching our own platform in the fall of 2021, we have pushed 22 major software updates to our vehicles. These updates have been filled with features such as Birds Eye Camera View, Drive Cam, Snow Mode, Camp Mode, Bed Mode and much more, all designed to enhance our customers experience.
Most recently this included the integration of a better route planner, which we expect to meaningfully improve our customers charging and routing experience. This technology will give our customers the ability to plan and compare charging stops along the way. It also provides us data to help with the site selection of our Rivian Adventure fast-charging network. And the road map we have is equally exciting. While I don't want to share too much yet, over the next months you will see us launch a towing mode update including trader profiles, but camera views, adaptive range estimation and doing charge stations discovery and the navigation app.
We also plan to launch drone mode, which will provide an immersive camera experience powered by our computer vision and augmented reality technologies. We believe that our software capabilities are a structural differentiator that will only grow in importance as electric vehicles continue to increase in complexity.
Our unique capabilities stem from the intentional decisions we made years ago, when we decided to truly take a clean sheet approach to the software stack and electrical hardware in the vehicle. What this means is that we own the software stack and control nearly every single computer in the vehicle. We designed our software stack to scale to multiple hardware architectures, allowing us to rapidly support three product variants with the high level of code reuse across R1T, R1S and EDV.
This modular platform approach is also enabling us to prepare a rapid migration to our next gen zonal electrical architecture, which brings increased levels of system integration and will allow us to achieve significant material cost savings thanks to the hardware consolidation.
As I mentioned earlier, at Rivian software is foundational. It supports and optimizes functions throughout the company. What I just described was on the consumer facing side of our work. The work my team does behind the scenes is equally important. Our connected software architecture allows us to gather sophisticated data that provide powerful insights, enabling us to improve the reliability and safety of our products and reduce our service costs.
It allows our service teams to perform remote diagnostics and assess the issues that customers may be experiencing well in advance. So we can determine when to deploy mobile service vehicles, what parts to bring, and in some cases even fix the issue through over-the-air software. This in-house platform also powers our manufacturing operations in the plant allowing us to have in line diagnostics that automatically detect potential assembly issues as the vehicle moves through the line and allows us to perform exhaustive electrical quality checks on our vehicles. This ultimately saves us time, improves quality, and improves efficiency during the manufacturing process.
As a team, we're excited about the work we do and the impact we are having. It's not often that you get the challenge to redefine how an industry views software. We're encouraged by the work we have done and even more excited about what's to come.
With that, let me turn the call over to Claire. Thanks Wassym. Second quarter results reflect the strong progress our team delivered against the operating plan we outlined earlier this year. As RJ mentioned, we remain focused on the drivers of long-term value for our business, ramping production, driving cost efficiencies, building future technologies and improving the customer experience.
Turning to our second quarter results, we produced 13,992 vehicles and delivered 12,640 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $1.1 billion of revenue we generated. Total revenue for the quarter included $34 million of proceeds from the sale of regulatory credits. We expect the sale of regulatory credits to increase over time, but to vary quarter to quarter.
During the second quarter, we improved our gross profit per vehicle by approximately $35,000 as compared to the first quarter of 2023, representing a growth margin improvement of over 4400 basis points. The primary drivers include fixed cost leverage, the change in LCNRV inventory write downs and losses on firm purchase commitments, material cost reduction and increased revenue per vehicle delivered.
Now going deeper into the material cost reduction drivers, after a full quarter of EDV production with the introduction of the LFP battery pack and our in-house Enduro Drive unit, we are now seeing a 35% reduction in material costs for our vans as compared to Q4 2022. Concurrently, we've seen and continue to see strong progress on our R1 material cost reduction through commercial cost down efforts and a reduction in short-term premiums.
Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $412 million as compared to negative $704 million in the same period last year. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2023 fell to $873 million as compared to $1 billion in the same period last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating expenses was related to lower levels of stock based compensation expense. We continue to rationalize our operating expenses despite significant investments in core in-vehicle technologies and the customer experience.
Over the past year, we've expanded our physical and mobile service offerings, increased our demo drive capacity, developed and launched a new motor platform, expanded our Rivian Adventure network, built a parts distribution center and remanufacturing center and so much more. All of this was done while lowering our quarterly operating expenses by $131 million of which $89 million consisted of cash expenses. These are all forward investments that position us to capitalize on our direct-to-customer relationship and enable us to scale efficiently as our car park grows.
Our gross profit improvements coupled with our operating expense rationalization resulted in $424 million of improvement in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $10.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We continue to believe that our cash can fund operations through 2025 and with the addition of our $1.5 billion green convertible notes and the amendment and extension of our $1.5 billion asset base lending agreement earlier this year, we have strengthened our balance sheet as we approach the launch of R2 in 2026.
Turning to our business outlook for 2023, we remain focused on ramping production and driving greater cost efficiency across the company. Based on the progress of our production ramp, including the ramp of our in-house motor, along with the latest understanding of the supply chain, we are increasing our production guidance to 52,000 total units. We have also seen strong progress in our cost down efforts and are improving our Adjusted EBITDA guidance to negative $4.2 billion dollars.
Finally, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance for 2023 to $1.7 billion due to a shift in capital expenditure timing. We continue to believe the average capital expenditures per year between this year and next year will be in the low $2 billion area.
In closing, we have seen progress in all three aspects of our path to generate positive gross margin, ramping productions, driving material costs down and increasing average selling price. The substantial reductions in EDV material costs driven by the introduction of the LFP Pack and Enduro Drive unit is reflective of the material cost improvements we expect to experience with our R1 platform following the 2024 shutdown to reroute the R1 line to 85,000 units per year and introduce new technologies.
This reinforces our confidence in our long term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is now open. Hi, good evening and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to dig in first on the gross margin improvement and I realize you said that you're making progress on each of the areas that you flagged in terms of improved fixed cost absorption and material cost reduction. But maybe you can give us a little bit of a voice over, a little bit deeper color on how this is playing out? How much more ground is there in terms of renegotiating some of your supplier contracts? How much more upside is there on the pricing front? And any color on the path to being a contribution margin positive, which is a step in ultimately getting to total gross margin positive? Thanks, Dan. Yes, this is a major, major focus for us as a business and something that across all aspects of product development or quality teams, our manufacturing teams we're working towards. And as we look at unpacking is your question sort of dug into the gross margin improvements, a portion of it absolutely is the fixed cost absorption improvements that just are born out of the increased volume. But I'm glad you point out a really important element of this is also material cost improvements, so reductions in our bill of materials. And this is -- what we're seeing today is some of, but not all of the improvements that are coming.
And as Claire said in her opening remarks, we've achieved roughly 35% reduction in material costs on the EDV program in conjunction with the shutdown that happened at the beginning of this year and we expect a similar level of reductions on R1 with the shutdown that's going to be coming next year. But preceding that there's a whole host of ongoing commercial negotiations, some of which were already beginning to feel and see on R1 and many of which are going to be coming.
And I want to just call out a few of the points that I also made in my opening comments. A lot of the improvements in engineering that are going into the vehicle are to drive cost out. So one of the biggest areas is the improvements we're making to the network architecture and consolidating a number of our ECUs into a smaller number of ECUs, ultimately a 60% reduction in the number of ECUs in the vehicle and along with that roughly 25% reduction in the wiring harness length in the vehicle.
And so when we look at, you know, when we talk about the confidence we have around further reductions in cost this is not confidence out of thin air. This is confidence that ties to contractual obligations associated with these component changes as well as contractual obligations with our suppliers built into commercial negotiations. And we'll continue to see significant improvements quarter-over-quarter in the cost structure to build our vehicles ultimately laddering up to the margin targets we talked about, the 25% gross margin target for our normal facility, for our normal vehicles produced in our own plant. And Claire, do you want to maybe just talk a little bit about some of the other aspects here around contribution? Sure. On a contribution margin basis, given the significant impact to our material costs on the EDV, the EDVs that we're producing today are contribution margin positive, and then as we think about the R1, the R1 will be contribution margin positive by the end of this year as you heard from RJ through continued progress on supplier contract negotiations as well as some of the upside to price as we introduce the max pack variant later this year. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, I think, one of the broader themes in the EV sales landscape today is just around demand and I think, there's questions broadly around some weakness of demand. Maybe you can give us a sense, I know you've taken away the order backlog, but what confidence do you have that you are -- that your backlog will sustain well into 2024 and that you're going to be supply constrained for the foreseeable future? One of the things we're perhaps most excited about is just how well received the products have been, and the level of excitement we see from our customers and the folks that are driving our vehicles and we see that manifesting in JD Power awarding us the highest level of customer satisfaction within the EV space, within the premium EV space. But importantly, we see it through the day-to-day interactions we have with the owners of our vehicles, and they become the biggest advocates and essentially marketers, if you will, for our brand and what we're building.
With that said we feel very confident in the continued backlog that we have we have clear visibility into deep, into 2024 with that backlog, that's established. And as more and more vehicles are on the roads and, we now have tens of thousands of R1s on the roads, it continues to feed the flywheel of awareness about the brand. And as I said some of our strongest advocates are people that are driving our vehicles every day. And so we we're quite bullish on the continued strong demand we have for our products. Great, thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And the next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks everybody. My first question is on Tesla charging. As we know, there's a kind of a two-way flow here where there's power, there's electrons going into the car, but then data coming out of the car to Tesla. So I'm curious, what data are you required to share or planning to share with Tesla as you join their charging network? Then I have a follow up. Adam, thanks for the question. Yes, this is a, I think an exciting development just around the relationship that we've put together with Tesla, along with other manufacturers to utilize the North American Charging Standard event as a part of that access their charging network. And we continue to build out our Rivian Adventure Network and that will also have North American Charging Standard adapters or plugs I should say, on it. And that allows us, with our network to access a very large car park with the existing Tesla car park that's out there, which gives us much clearer visibility to profitability of our charging network as well.
But in terms of, specifically what occurs in terms of data transfer, there's not any data transfer built into the relationship. So it's a charging relationship whereby our customers will access the network and ultimately pay for the charging, and that will flow from us through to Tesla. Okay. Thanks for confirming that. And just to follow up on your ADAS strategy, you have Mobileye today, but we understand you'll be adding your own camera based ADAS systems side by side with Mobileye on the same windshield. I'm just wondering how long you plan on having these two redundant systems together before you substitute out Mobileye and rely on your own in-house system? Thanks. Yes. As we think about some of the key differentiating elements of what we're building, of course Wassym spoke about our electronic stack and building our own network architecture and designing and developing all the core to use in the vehicle which is what facilitates and enables this significant reduction in number of ECUs in the vehicle that will be coming into play next year.
In much the same way, we also deeply believe that controlling the sensor set the perception stack across the vehicle and allowing that to feed into our autonomy compute module, what that gives us is the ability to have really early fusion of information, meaning we can cross leverage information across multiple cameras, our radar set and in the future additional sensors as well to put us in the best position to have high quality perception information that feeds into our control algorithms.
So with that as a, I guess, bit of a technical background on it, that's the reason we've taken the view of owning the hardware stack and the software stack around our self-driving platform is going to put us in a position to create long-term the lowest cost system with early sensor fusion, and therefore the highest level of confidence from the perception stack feeding into the, feeding into the control control system. Okay. Thanks RJ. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Good evening, guys. I just, RJ I just wanted to follow up in particularly, because we have Wassym on the line as well, on that comment you just made, when we think about that Nextgen architecture, I can understand kind of what you're, what you just talked about. Is there anything else from the software side or the functionality of the vehicle from the powertrain side or the HMI side that this Nextgen architecture allows you to do that you might not be able to do right now, and it might put you, out in front in the lead versus other vehicles? Oh, sure. Well, thanks John. This is something we're super excited about. It's actually the reason we had Wassym join the call today so we could provide some additional color and commentary on the importance of software and how this is such a core aspect of our organization and built into every aspect of how we think about our vehicle platforms and architectures. Just to comment on, and I'll pass it to Wassym for some additional comments, broadly if we wind the clock back many years, we took the decision to develop all the ECUs across the vehicle and so that's, typically these are ECUs would be coming from Tier 1 suppliers, and those ECUs typically when they come from Tier 1 suppliers, they're sort of embodied in that ECU is a set of functions and therefore of course a set of software applications and that mosaic in a traditional world, that mosaic of third party, Tier 1 sourced ECUs has to work together.
And it's a very cumbersome network architecture to work with and makes things like over the updates very, very difficult because coordinate, you have to coordinate across multiple different companies on a software platform and software stack that, you as the manufacturer would know. And so we felt very, very strongly that this is something that had to be cord us as a business. We built deep domain expertise in terms of our electronics development capability of course our software development capability. And that, of course, launched into the R1 product where we own the software stack, we own essentially all the ECUs in the vehicle.
What that also does, in addition to allowing us to do lots of over the updates, and as you heard Wassym mentioned earlier, since the launch, we've had 22 major over the year updates, beyond that it allows us to look at cost optimization in a really unique way because a specific controller is not tied to a specific sourcing relationship or to a specific set of functions, but rather we control the controller and we control what's on it.
So over time, we're consolidating the number of computers we have in the car to be significantly reduced. And next year that first step of that is a 60% reduction in the number of computers in the car relative today. Now that doesn't necessarily directly create customer features. Of course, it takes cost out of the vehicle, allows us to operate with, we think, a significant multi-thousand dollar structural cost advantage relative to the traditional approach. But importantly, it also opens up opportunities to do some really amazing features where you can cross leverage compute, you can cross leverage perception as I referred to with Adam's question.
But Wassym, maybe if you can talk just a little bit about this, I know you said in your comments we don't want to give away too much, but we, until late last night, Wassym and I were reviewing some of our software roadmap, and I'm so excited for the world to see the things that we have coming soon, Wassym maybe you can talk a bit about that. Yes, absolutely. I think really the core strength that we have is, we own every single computer on the vehicle. So we're able to not only update the infotainment or the connectivity, but we can update the vehicle controls, we can update the vehicle dynamics, the energy management, ADAS, the way the vehicle drives, the way the vehicle navigates, communicates with the entire world. We're able to create end-to-end unique experiences that really redefine the ownership with our customers and really create that regular connection with our community of customers.
So we have those capabilities to continue enhancing the feature set. Through that complex integration, we're also able to leverage on those skills, so that we can virtually distribute all these different software features into more constrained hardware platforms in the future, which will bring significant cost down and significant bill of material savings for us for the next generation. I think the last item that I really want to highlight and this is usually not very obvious.
I think it's really the role of software behind the scenes. It's the entire connected data infrastructure that we have created where we not only collect data to help with product improvements, reliability improvements, safety improvements, but we're also able to help with reducing the service costs for the company. We're also helping with the acceleration of the overall manufacturing ramp. We're also able to help with the improvement from a quality standpoint for our manufacturing. Yes. That's very helpful. Can I just ask one last one just on the R1S was it 70% of the R1 mix in the quarter? Yes. I'm just curious how we should think about mix on the R1s going forward. Is the R1s going to continue to take a greater portion of the mix as that's ramping up further and further or is this the kind of level set mix we should think about going forward? Yes, John, it's a great question. We commented on before up through the first quarter of this year we'd been producing in any given quarter, majority of vehicles were produced were R1T and the second quarter, this past quarter was the first time that R1S represented a majority of what we're producing. And so, for the next quarter or two, we'll be producing greater than, 70% plus of R1S to help address some of the really long backlog. And this is by far and away one of the biggest customer complaints we have, which is the amount of wait time associated with getting a Rivian today. So to bias a little bit towards addressing some of that, that very long painful backlog for R1S, but then with that steady state long-term settling into about 70% R1S production with the remaining 30% being R1T. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now? We can, Rod. Okay. Sorry about that. Was hoping that you can give us a sense first of all on the bomb and advantage that you see from being able to acquire components with your own silicon and software? Presumably most of your peers are still buying, steering systems and braking systems, and ADAS systems and suppliers are generating some additional revenue for the, the engineering and software that they are adding. Is there a way to maybe talk about what this actually will ultimately mean for an R1 and R2 in terms of dollars per vehicle and when you'll be sort of a more competitive than in terms of cost? Yes, this is a great questions. It's a bit hard to speak to from an apples-to-apples point of view. But what I'd like to do, just maybe look at two aspects of this. The first is, as you said, removing the Tier 1 as an aggregator of features onto an ECU, what you might often hear called a domain controller that removes that, that margin stacking effect. But importantly it allows us to optimize the way we design the hardware around what we're delivering from a feature set point of view. Meaning we're not taking a piece of hardware that's been developed for a broad application across many to many different vehicles. Take like a body controller or a powertrain control module. So the first is just the optimization that occurs simply by it being specifically designed for us.
But the second, and that, I've spoken to this a couple times here that I think is really, really important and very hard to do, if you don't control the hardware in its entirety, is the ability to consolidate what are typically separate ECUs that are tied to specific function sets. And to be able to consolidate those ECUs into single computers that are really tying to a zone of the vehicle, like let's say a front zone of the vehicle a middle zone of the vehicle, a rear zone of the vehicle. And that massive reduction in number of computers in the vehicle not only simplifies not only reduces the number of modules, but also simplifies the wiring harness and the electrical architecture in the vehicle. And so this is an area for us that's been a core focus. And ultimately we're talking about thousands of dollars in savings per vehicle.
And to be able to build an architecture that has as few of computers as small number of computers as possible, as simplified of a wiring harness as possible becomes a massive enabler for cost down. And we're going to see that first in R1 next year with some of the changes I talked about already. But importantly, this forms the basis of what will be going into R2. And, R2 from a cost point of view has very aggressive targets, above and beyond just what we're putting in place with the electrical architecture and the compute stack that's in the vehicle, but also, well into other aspects of body design, which will leverage the opportunities afforded to it through the simplification of electronics and network architecture. Okay. Thanks for that. Was hoping you can just separately talk about any progress that you've made in your discussions with Amazon regarding the exclusivity deal and just thoughts on the outlook for demand for the EDV and, whether some resolution of that is required in order to achieve the, the target of positive gross profit next year. Sure. So we continue to have a great relationship with Amazon. It's a great partnership. I think one of the things that I'd want to call out is just the complexities of scaling a logistics network or I should say, taking a scaled logistics network and converting it to electric. As I said, my opening comments we're now, we now have EDVs operating in over 800 cities across the United States. We've recently entered Europe with the product. And the feedback we're getting from drivers has been incredible. You can find this sort of all over the web and certainly no shortage of YouTube clips around just the, I'd say the level of excitement and how, the drivers recognizing the amount of driver focus that went into the design of all the, the touch points, the ingress, egress, the UI, so we're really pleased with that.
Now with that said, as we work closely with Amazon to expand how many of those vehicles are getting out, and of course that ties to how rapidly we ramp the production of the EDV product. We're also in, and I've talked about this before, actively working with Amazon to allow us to sell vehicles outside of Amazon sooner than what was originally contemplated in our contract. And so that work remains ongoing. We're very optimistic on that work. Again, the close partnership and of course, Amazon's large position in Rivian helps align incentives to have us solve this year very shortly. And Rod, addressing your second part of the question on impact to gross profit positive in 2024 we hadn't contemplated any external sales beyond Amazon from a commercial standpoint in the, the comments that we've historically made. Okay. Just, just to clarify, are you contemplating Amazon at its current run rate or is that a major factor at all in the positive gross profit target? The way I would characterize it is, as we've talked about in the past, Q4 is always a seasonally low volume quarter for Amazon and so that is also been reflected in our gross margin commentary given the Q4, bridge that we've spoken about in the past. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first to focus on your pricing strategy, I know you mentioned earlier that the demand landscape is incredibly strong, but I'm curious as to whether you have thoughts on what's happening with some of your competition in the marketplace and whether you feel comfortable with current prices, your vehicles. Thanks, George. We've we take a very methodical and thoughtful approach to how we look at our vehicle pricing and, if we look at between the R1T and the R1S each of those products when we think about a price, there's actually a band of pricing that they operate across, and that band is enabled or unlocked, if you will by the introduction of additional variance. So the first step in that is introducing the dual motor into the vehicles. As you heard in my opening comments, the dual motor as our “base powertrain” is a really exciting configuration. It's still capable of zero to 60 and three and a half seconds towing of 11,000 pounds. It's really an enjoyable architecture. And as a base configuration, it's outstanding.
And of course, it doesn't have the same off-road capabilities necessarily as the quad motor, but we think for a majority of use cases, it's really a perfect fit. So that's the first step in providing customers with a lower price variant of either R1T or R1S. And then the next step, which is coming here shortly, is the introduction of our standard pack. And the standard pack not only is a lower cost pack for us to build, but importantly allows customers skin to an R1 vehicle just over $70,000. And so as we think about the positioning of the product, the capabilities of the product with on-road, off-road dynamically the feature set that's in the vehicles, we feel quite comfortable with the positioning of what we've done.
Now, I'd also want to just comment, there's lots of ways to try to measure demand, and one of the things, we look very closely at is residual value. And residual value is nice because, it gives us a reflect, it sort of reflects, how our used vehicles are trading, which gives us indication of overall demand positioning. And the R1 products within the truck and SUV segment are among the best residual values of any product in those categories, regardless of electric or combustion. So across both combustion vehicles and electric vehicles, our vehicles are maintaining value extremely well.
And even so far as a brand, typically you buy a brand new car the moment you “transact on a vehicle”, you lose roughly 10% to 15% of its value. People often say you drive an awful lot and it loses value in our case, once the transaction occurs, the vehicle value doesn't really drop. They're maintaining really well. And of course that's just an artifact of the strong demand backdrop that we have and the willingness to pay for the products we're building. Thank you. And maybe as a follow up, you spent a lot of time in the release discussing vertical integration, maybe relative to your initial plans, a couple, few years ago, the speed at which you vertically integrate maybe has have been a little bit slower. So I'm curious if there is one key component of your business that you could insource today in a world of infinite capital, theoretically, what would it be? Thank you. The -- we spoke about this a bunch on the call today. The area that I would say, we've -- from the very beginning, we knew we wanted to completely control and we do completely control Very good about this is investing in the software and electronics capabilities within the vehicle. So I would say that's among the most important things to own in looking at what is a structurally cost-advantaged vehicle manufacturer look like in the world of today.
We've recently vertically integrated our drive unit, and that's with the Enduro drive unit at the single motor per axle. And Claire commented on this before, but that is creating very meaningful cost advantages relative to what we launched with. And just as a reminder, what we launched with, we did the inverter in-house the gearbox in-house, the assemblage in-house, we purchased the rotor and stator from a supplier.
On our dual-motor setup, that's now coming house, and that's the strategy we'll continue to pursue with the propulsion platform, and we're working very hard to continue to advance that given the cost efficiencies and cost advantages that clearly is driving in the business. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. I was hoping to better understand the financial outlook and the updated EBITDA guidance for 2023. I believe it implies a slightly larger EBITDA loss in the second half of this year relative to the first. So I was hoping to better understand what the drivers of that may be. Mark, what are the key drivers embedded within that second half guidance is a more conservative outlook around the magnitude of tailwinds that we ascribed to the unwind or reduction in our LCNRV charges on a go-forward basis. And so that's a little bit of color as you think about the fact, excluding LTV, we expect to make significant progress against our improved gross margins as we track throughout the second half of the year.
We began to introduce the Enduro drive units that RJ just spoke about into the R1 vehicles that will be a material cost reduction There the continued progress from a commercial cost vantage point as well as some of the increases that we'll continue to see as we ramp up production in the course of Q3. and importantly as well, drive towards higher average selling prices through the introduction of our dual Max pack in the end of this year as well. Thanks for that Claire. And then my other question was just on the opportunity for sell products beyond the vehicle. I mean you spoke a bit already around software -- but I think there's other services and accessories that are an important part of the long-term opportunity for Rivian in terms of profitability, so things like insurance and selling some of the gear and camping accessories curious if you could share an update around where the company stands on providing some of those products? Thanks. Thanks, Mark. When we think about the overall revenue opportunities we have as a business. Of course, the obvious place for us to all sort of our minds to go to is the vehicle. But there's a whole ecosystem of products and services that surround the vehicle that we think represents significant opportunities, both in terms of alleviating customer pain points, but also in terms of creating really exciting and sort of joyful customer experiences. And so that starts with the purchase process and simplifying what a digital transaction looks like, which we've done through our platforms, we continue to push ourselves hard to improve that further that then immediately connects into the insurance platform. We've not announced any of this specifics on the returns for our insurance platform, but it's a profitable part of our business, and it's -- the attach rate on this is quite high.
So we're very bullish on the long-term potential of our insurance offering. And then as you called out, what we think of as our adventure product? So the year that goes with the vehicle, this is a huge opportunity and something that, particularly as we look at the R2 product line, there's really exciting intentionally thought out opportunities that sort of as the vehicles are being architected, we're putting some of these really fun personalization items into this contemplated adventure products offering where it also moves cost out of the core vehicle and into the accessories, which allows us to achieve a baseline vehicle with very aggressive cost structure.
And then last but certainly not least is the role that software complaints. So there's a host of ways this has been talked about and looked at. I think often, this is sometimes oversold. I'd say, in the space where we sort of imagine these very, very large revenue numbers or companies often imagine these, I want to call out that we believe table stakes are going to be -- is going to require a very robust, very thorough software platform but it still provides opportunities for very specific, unique, highly differentiated, highly complex features to be sold as an additional service or subscription. And we've seen this play out in the autonomy space, but we see and where we certainly have plans for ourselves, but there's a host of other areas. And Wassym, if you can just talk about this for a moment because this is something I know you and I spend a lot of time on. Thanks, RJ. I mean, first of all, we are developing and expanding software and services for our commercial business. Every EDV that we sell today comes with a subscription for [indiscernible]. We continue to enhance the road map and add more features and more services to it. On the consumer side, as RJ mentioned, we are being really extremely thoughtful about which features could become paid options. We believe that there is an opportunity in a specific subset of features. Those features need to meet certain criteria.
It has -- this is the future that require a very high level of complexity from a development standpoint or features, which require high compute, whether it's in the vehicle or in the cloud. We have internally road map that we will communicate as we basically build it with our customers. Thank you very much. Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. So it sounds like the factory rerates planned for next year is a very important step in towards reaching your goals. Can you maybe just help us understand again the timing of it? And importantly, what sort of available capacity you would leave you with on the other side of it, but also effective capacity for 2024 as a whole? Yes. Thanks, Emmanuel. The updates we're making to the line next year, I'm glad you asked the question what you did. They have really two core purposes. The first is, as you called out, it's a capacity increase for the R1 line, where we effectively grow the capacity of R1 from 65,000 units on an annual basis to 85,000 units. But I'd say more importantly in the area that we believe we're going to have certainly, there will be lots of interest in over the next few quarters is what that represents in terms of a step change in our cost structure.
And we integrate with that shutdown, a host of product level improvements that simplify the vehicle and remove considerable costs consistent with what Claire and I both spoke about before that we saw with – associated with the shutdown in EV. Now that's not to say, and I want to be very clear. It's not going to say cost improvements aren't happening, leading up to that.
We have a very clear road map with contractually set up agreements with our suppliers. Some of those being commercial, some of those being technical changes preceding this batch, if you will, of changes – coordinated changes that are happening with the shutdown. Now in terms of the timing of shutdown that will be happening mid next year, we are doing everything we possibly can to minimize the amount of time we need to have the line down to make those changes and improvements. But it will have an impact as a result of the line being down on the R1 output during that time frame. And our – we haven't provided guidance in terms of 2024 production volume. Yet, but certainly, that will play into ultimately the guidance we do provide. Okay. That's very helpful. And then let me ask you about your balance sheet. Claire, you made comments in the prepared remarks that you've obviously strengthened it, and you still have $10 million in cash. And it will take you to, I guess, operationally through 2025. How are you thinking about additional needs for capital raise and potential timing of it and the modalities of it? Like is it something that you could -- you would think of doing short -- sooner rather than later or to the extent that you have room until 2025, it will be later on or more opportunistic? Thanks, Emmanuel. As you mentioned, we remain confident in our cash balance and the fact that it can fund our operations through 2025. And as I spoke about in my prepared remarks with the addition of the convertible notes that we raised in our ABL, that further derisks the launch of R2 as we think about the $10.2 billion of cash and equivalents we have on the balance sheet today.
But with that said, our priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet. For us, it provides a safeguard during volatile industry conditions and mitigate risk while scaling important growth capital projects such as the investments that we're making into R2 and our facility in Georgia as well.
And so with that in mind, we'll continue to evaluate a variety of capital markets available to Rivian across the entirety of the capital structure. And as we've spoken about and exemplified prior actions in the first half of this year, we'll continue to employ a diversified approach as we look to maintain that strong long-term balance sheet position. Great. Thank you. Thank you. One moment. And the final question will come from the line of Benjamin Kallo with R.W. Baird. Mr. Kallo, your line is now open. Next question, one moment, it comes from the line of Chris Pierce with Needham. Your final question. Can you just talk about the mechanics in the plumbing behind the 1-day sale in the sense that are these new customers or existing reservation holders that are kind of willing to swap out of a current reservation versus waiting for reservation or is this kind of to get flexibility having the vehicle sooner? Or do customers tend to want what they want, and this gives you opportunity to kind of find new customers? I just want to get the sense of how it went, will we see more of them, that type of thing. Thanks, Chris. I think you're referring to an event we did in Normal and where we had on-site sale. Yes. Yes, I think this has gotten so much more attention than we ever could have imagined. This was an artifact of us looking at some of the vehicles that are coming off the line and the potential where those vehicles were sort of late on matches where our customer changed order configuration or changed color combination, whatever the case may have been where they were available to be matched locally and essentially provide a on having to shift the vehicles.
It was something we did more as an experiment to look at. I would say it's sort of one of many types of experience we run conduct being direct to consumer and having the ability to do things like that. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. R.J. Scaringe for closing remarks, please. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining today. We're really excited about the progress we're making in and hopefully reflected in collectively in our comments and discussions today. It's clear that our focus very much remains on not only ramp -- continuing to ramp production in our normal production facility, but importantly, driving costs down across the business on our path to profitability.
And we see that manifesting in significant progress between Q1 and Q2 and our overall gross margin structure, and we intend to continue to make that type of progress as we approach the long-term target for the Normal facility of 25% gross margins. I'd say the other point I'd want to call out and this, again, evidenced by Wassym joining us here on the call is just the importance that we place on the tactical differentiation of our products and our platform and not only enabling us to run and manage our operations more effectively in terms of over their updates, continued progress or continued features that make a range of vehicles, but importantly, actually simplifying the vehicle architecture because of the control of these core technology stacks around electronics, software and associated network architecture. And that really forms the basis of the foundation, if you will, for what's to come with our R2 platform. And this is so foundational to what we're building in, obviously, takes a lot of work on the front end to build all this capability and both on the hardware side and the software side.
But we're going to start to see the benefits of that being realized in the immediate term through the cost savings and the significant improvements we'll see quarter-over-quarter. But importantly, we'll see it when we reveal and show the products for R2 and the level of content and what will be available at the price points we'll be talking about for R2 when we show that product early next year. So with that, thank you, everyone, for joining and look forward to our next call. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call.
Before we begin, matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions, reflect management's views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I'll highlight key developments during the third quarter and provide an update on the progress we're making against our core value drivers.
Importantly, I want to take this opportunity to provide some broader perspective on the EV space. There's been a lot of noise and a lot of dialogue recently around EV adoption. And I want to emphatically state just how deeply convicted we are that the entire automotive industry will be transitioning to electric over the next 1 to 2 decades.
We've built and designed our business around this transition. We've designed our team structure, our technology stack, the way we approach vertical integration to not only help our business scale profitably, but to ensure we're positioned to be a leader in this generational opportunity. We believe a substantial competitive advantage is our approach to vertically integrating our in-vehicle computers, software stack and propulsion platform, along with our efficient direct-to-consumer go-to-market strategy. R2 will benefit from investments we've made in R1, and will represent our first global platform.
Additionally, Rivian's production ramp and introduction of multiple vehicle platforms in our Illinois plant, has provided significant learnings in a compressed time frame. Our team will apply this experience to our new manufacturing facility in Georgia, with the goal of achieving a considerably lower cost structure.
Now in the short term, I want to acknowledge the macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures impacting consumers and businesses, most notably the increase in interest rates. In this context, we remain laser focused on the factors within our control: driving greater cost efficiency, continue to ramp production, investing in differentiated technologies, continuing to enhance the Rivian customer experience and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial and operating results during the third quarter of 2023 represent progress on each of these fronts.
Before I get into the third quarter's milestones and performance, I wanted to touch on an important development, which was just released. We have amended our Amazon agreement with terms and conditions, which provide the opportunity to sell commercial vans to other customers, helping more companies reduce their CO2 emissions.
With more than 10,000 EDVs on the road, and 260 million delivered packages, we are already seeing meaningful impact from our initial rollout. We are excited to continue our work with Amazon to deliver on their initial order of 100,000 vehicles, along with a diverse set of new commercial customers. We're confident in the value of our vans, software and services offerings can provide fleet customers, and are in active discussions with a number of large potential fleet customers to launch pilot programs. It's important to appreciate that the sales cycle for commercial vans typically begins with lower volume pilot programs.
The most recent quarter demonstrated sequential production growth, further improvement in our profitability per vehicle, introduction of a new Max Pack variant, with up to 410 miles of range, rollout of multiple over-the-year updates to enhance the customer experience and focused investment on commercial infrastructure to support our expanding fleet of vehicles.
Within the plant, we continue to see progress across our production lines. We produced 16,304 vehicles during the third quarter and continued to ramp our Enduro driving line. As a result of this, we are raising our production guidance for the year to 54,000 total units.
Later this month, we plan to take about a week of downtime for validation builds, to support the incorporation of engineering design changes into the R1 platform, which will be implemented in the planned downtime in the second quarter of 2024, which we discussed in the last earnings call. These new technologies include our simplified electronic control unit topology, and cost reductions across a variety of areas, including the vehicle harness, body structure and battery pack. These technology changes represent Rivian's continued emphasis on driving greater cost efficiency. They will significantly contribute to driving towards Rivian's long-term gross margin targets.
Rivian vehicles have now driven over 490 million miles, which provides us with great data and feedback on how our vehicles perform in different environments, and what features can be added or enhanced to improve our customer experience. This past quarter, we pushed major over-the-year updates, which improved drive quality, enhanced the towing experience and offer customers a new way to interact with the different drive modes. Over 90% of our customers update their software within 5 days of it becoming available. It's great to see this level of engagement with our software.
Later this quarter, we plan to launch our leasing platform on select R1T vehicles in certain regions. We look forward to offering this as a new way for our customers to take delivery of Rivian and plan to expand the lease offering to additional regions across more vehicles as the program matures.
We currently have 45 service centers along with 408 mobile service vehicles. In addition, we recently opened Rivian Spaces, our version of retail stores in Vancouver, Seattle, Chicago, Brooklyn, Nashville, Atlanta and Denver. Our DC fast charging network also continues to expand. We currently have 57 Rivian Adventure Network charging sites.
Progress continued on the development of the R2 platform, as well as preparing the future production site in Georgia. I was just there a few weeks ago. It's great to see the site starting to take form, which is the direct result of a strong collaboration between the state, local community and Rivian. It was a strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our operational and financial goals. I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders for their continued support of our vision.
With that, I'll pass the call to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I would like to reiterate that our team is focused on 4 key value drivers: driving greater cost efficiency, continuing to ramp production, investing in differentiated technologies and continuing to enhance the Rivian customer experience. Third quarter results demonstrate advancement in each of these aspects of our business.
During the third quarter, we produced 16,304 vehicles and delivered 15,564 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $1.3 billion of revenue we generated. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $477 million. We remain focused on improving our gross profit per vehicle delivered.
During the third quarter, our gross loss per vehicle improved by approximately $2,000 versus the second quarter. This improvement would have been approximately $14,000 better, excluding the impact of the change in LCNRV and losses on firm purchase commitments. So therefore, LCNRV and losses on firm purchase commitments more significantly contributed to the improvement in gross profit during the second quarter as compared to the third quarter, highlighting the improvements we have made in ramping production and reducing the material cost of our vehicles.
As a reminder, when our LCNRV balance and losses on firm purchase commitments declines, it reduces cost of goods sold and positively contributes to gross profit. We expect by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges associated with the production at our Illinois plant as we reached positive gross profit.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $942 million. In October of this year, we raised a $1.75 billion green convertible note, which further strengthens our balance sheet as we approach the expected start of construction of our Georgia plant early next year.
By maintaining a strong balance sheet, we're well positioned as we look to start production of the R2 platform in 2026. The offering was not completed until after the quarter end. Accordingly, the $1.6 billion of net proceeds from the raise was not included in our Q3 2023 ending cash balance of $9.1 billion.
Turning to our business outlook for 2023. We remain focused on ramping production and driving greater cost efficiency across the company. Based on the progress we've seen year-to-date across our manufacturing process, and our cost down efforts, we are raising each aspect of our 2023 annual guidance. We are raising our production guidance to 54,000 units, improving EBITDA guidance to negative $4 billion and lowering our CapEx guidance to $1.1 billion. The improvement in estimated CapEx is driven mostly by timing of spend and by our efforts to reduce costs across the business.
As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4, relative to prior periods.
As RJ mentioned, and as we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we expect to shut down both the consumer and commercial lines in our Illinois facility in the second quarter of 2024, to introduce a number of new and vehicle technologies to the R1 platform. We believe these changes will meaningfully reduce our material costs and position Rivian to exit 2024 with a much improved margin profile. We are planning to adjust the production rate of the lines, whereby the planned annual capacity will be for 85,000 units for R1 and 65,000 units for EDV, keeping the total facility at an annual capacity of 150,000 units.
Our downtime in Q2 2024 and associated ramp-up in Q2 and Q3 2024 is expected to impact roughly 2 quarters of production, while the incorporation of new design changes impact near-term production, we are confident it better positions Rivian to be more profitable and competitive over the long term.
Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. I have a question on cost and a question on demand. Just first, my impression is that you're making better-than-expected progress on costs, just simply because you improved your gross loss by $16,000 ex LCNRV. I didn't see any average price improvement and presumably volume isn't helping you just yet because you haven't gotten to contribution margin positive on the R1. So is that correct? Because it is interesting since you haven't yet benefited from the new architecture of the Pack and all the other things that are coming into 2024. Thanks for the question, Rod. As you think about the key drivers and the margin improvement that we saw over the last quarter, it was driven by the 23% increase that we saw in delivery volumes. So there was some fixed cost leverage.
But we also saw significant improvements in material costs which was driven both by a mix shift to greater concentration of EDV delivery volumes. So roughly about 30% of our revenue in Q3 was from the sales of the EDV itself, which is, as you mentioned, is a higher margin, already contribution margin positive for Rivian vehicle platform for us.
But beyond the EDV, we also saw significant material cost savings as well for R1, driven by the continued work of our procurement team as we've been renegotiating many of our supply agreements. And then it also incorporated some of the early sales of our dual motor to consumers as well that benefited the reduction in material costs. In addition to those 2 key levers, we also saw continued softening in the broader logistics market and space. And so that was also a contributor to the improvement that we saw on a per unit basis for Q3. That's helpful. So yes, the contribution margin must be on the RCVs.
On the demand side, could you talk about how quickly you can expand the RCV to other customers? I understand that there's a process with pilots and planning with these fleets. But any thoughts on how we can think about RCV sales into 2024 or 2025?
And on the R1, you're currently on -- at 65,000 units, you will be at 85,000 units at the end of next year capacity presumably, you'd need at least 180 orders per average day just to meet like your current capacity. Maybe you could talk a little bit about whether you're seeing convergence to that kind of a number. What's the trajectory of demand that you're seeing in the orders? Rod, thanks for your question on the commercial vehicle and R1.
Just to speak first on the commercial vehicle side. We -- of course, we've been working on the exclusivity agreement with Amazon for a while, and we've talked about this in past earnings calls. So it's not as if we were surprised by that this morning. And with that, we've been building the relationships with a diverse set of commercial operators, and that's everything from last mile to retail, to a wide variety of industrial or commercial business cases which require -- businesses that require commercial vans.
And while the fleet and the use cases are diverse, the one element that's very common for these large fleets is the necessity of running pilots as a way to prep the network or prep the system to ingest a completely different type of vehicle in terms of its need for charging infrastructure, and as well as changes to the standard operating procedure for those respective businesses. And so what we'll be announcing soon is a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.
As it pertains to R1, we, of course, you can see in the numbers for Q3, we continue to maintain an extremely strong market share position at the price points at which the R1 platform operates. So as you think about volume of vehicles, electric vehicles sold, let's say, at over $75,000 price point. We're a very significant market share player, that the brand is connected incredibly well with consumers. And we're seeing that translate to not only continued excitement for the brand, but we see that really manifest as really strong residual values and in particular, really strong used vehicle pricing. So Google search of used Rivian R1S will just reveal just how robust the pricing and therefore, the demand for these products are.
So with that said, this is before we've even launched a number of additional variants that are going to be coming online. We've just recently launched Max Pack. We've launched the Dual-Motor. But early next year, we'll be launching our standard battery pack. We'll be launching additional trim configuration. And importantly, starting now or starting later this month, we're going to be launching, on select models as you heard Claire and I described in the opening statements, select model is a leasing program, and that leasing program creates a different way for customers to access the product, which is really helpful in an environment with interest rates as we see them today.
So we remain very bullish on R1 program and its long-term demand, and as I indicated, I think the RCV platform, our commercial van platform really is, in our view, the best commercial van option available for fleet of, any sort of large fleet, and we're working very hard to translate that into volume over the course of the next several quarters with these pilot programs that I referred to at the start. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America. Just a quick question on the fourth quarter implied volumes. It looks like they're a fair amount lower than what you did in the third quarter on production.
I'm just curious, is this is a question of days in the calendar? Or is there something else going on sort of in the plan? Is it what you mentioned on the Amazon deliveries where you might downshift the EDV a little bit? I mean what's going on there? Claire spoke to this in opening statements, but we have -- we're planning a longer shutdown in the second quarter of 2024, to implement a whole host of changes that introduced a dramatic reduction in our material costs of building materials for the R1 platform. But those changes also improve the operations of the plant and allow us to produce vehicles with less labor per vehicle, and therefore, less cost per vehicle.
Preceding that shutdown in Q2 2024, we have a 1-week shutdown in Q4. And that's planned to do some of the longer lead changes in the plant, and it requires us to shut down all production for approximately a week. So you're certainly seeing that in the numbers. And then I'd say broadly, we're also recognizing some of the days lost around the holidays associated with Christmas and, of course, the New Year Holiday. Okay. And then just one follow-up on the physical service network build-out. RJ, how are you sizing that at the moment? Because I mean that's obviously something that you're getting way ahead of the customer needs there. How you're locating, deciding on locations, what's the cost of those? And how are you sizing those? Yes. As you know, we've -- and we've talked about this in the past, in past earnings calls, we are building a service footprint that relies on both physical brick-and-mortar service locations, we'll have about 50 of those in the U.S. by the end of this year. But supplementing that and actually performing a majority of our service are mobile service vehicles. And our mobile service vehicle fleet, as I said, at the start is more than 400 vehicles, today, it's -- as of, I think, this week, it's 408, but it continues to grow.
And that the beauty of mobile service-first strategy is from a customer point of view, it's a much easier process. So if there's an issue on the vehicle rather than you as the customer having to deal with the vehicle being dropped off or taken to a service center, we simply come to you, we come to your house, we come to your place of business, and perform the service on site. And more than half -- well over half of all of our service operations there, mobile, we expect that to shift into greater than 3/4 of all service operations, will be performed with mobile service.
Now that doesn't completely relieve the need for physical infrastructure. The physical infrastructure is important for more significant service activities. And as I said, that's why we continue to grow and invest in that network, and we'll see that growing where -- since we put service locations closest to where we have large pools or large pockets of demand. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with UBS. Claire, I know you sort of talked a little bit about some of the puts and takes into next year. But you're right now running at a $65,000 run rate this quarter. So in the context of the downtime and the $150,000 total capacity, how should we be thinking about next year's potential? Is that sort of 65% run rate about the right level you guys are planning for next year? So as you mentioned, there's going to be a number of puts and takes overall. And it's important to note that the impacts of the shutdown are temporary in nature, but the benefits will be there for the future, and RJ spoke briefly to -- just the magnitude of technology changes that will be introduced into the R1 vehicles next year that creates a true step change in our material cost road map, and past deposit gross profit margin for us as a whole.
So as you think about the cadence of the year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right, we'll start Q1, again, to our current and existing run rate. And then Q2 and Q3 will be heavily impacted quarters from a production standpoint, where we'll take multiple weeks of downtime throughout the course of Q2. And then we'll be ramping up all of the respective variance of R1, both in Q2 and into Q3 as well.
And then as we've talked about in the past, Q4 becomes that run rate potential for the business where you'll see Rivian continuing to ramp up our volumes from a production standpoint for both R1, as well as our commercial volumes. You'll see the full impacts of each of the new technologies, hitting our material costs, that also coincides with a significant percentage of the commercial cost down opportunity that we have in front of us as well. And so those elements come together in connection as well with Rivian fulfilling our pre-3/1/2022 preorders, which also results in a step change in our average selling price of the vehicle over that period of time as well. So next year is certainly a year of different puts and takes, but that's directionally how I would think about the volume cadence. Okay. That's helpful. And actually, that danced nicely into my next question in -- RJ or Claire, I mean, you've talked about this in the past about the higher ASPs with the backlog. And RJ, you sort of mentioned some of the affordability concerns out there on -- in EVs, but really, I'd say, in broader auto as well, at least in the headlines.
So clearly, you have good visibility on your backlog through '24. But how are you thinking about or planning for the margin profile for the business when you -- once you go past that, like if affordability is a greater concern, do you have enough line of sight on cost reduction initiatives or other efforts to sort of help balance out what might be a little bit of a tougher pricing environment? Yes, we've talked about this a bit in the past, but when we think about the R1 platform, we launched with Quad-Motor Large Pack, that's our middle-sized pack and one trim configuration. And what we've done over the last few months as we start to introduce additional build combinations above and beyond that. So we introduced the Dual-Motor, that's built around our Enduro motor platform. We, of course, introduced our Max Pack, which is our largest battery pack. Next year, we'll be introducing our standard pack, which is our smallest battery pack, and we'll be introducing a variety of different trim and build combinations along with that over the course of the next year.
And what that does is it provides us with a broader spread of prices or price choices for consumers on the R1 platform to essentially be able to target both the most price-sensitive customers, as well as customers are looking to buy sort of the fully loaded maximum content vehicle. And what that effectively does is it allows us to benefit from the higher margin profile on these higher price, full content vehicles and balance it with the lower priced, lower content vehicles and still look at it as we look at that in the lens of ASP, still see ASP grow over time. And a big contributor to that, which Claire alluded to is, as we start to blend in newer pricing and we move past the pre-March 1, 2022 pricing, that's also going to have an accretive effect on overall ASP.
The other thing to keep in mind from a demand point of view, is just the scale of the segments that we're operating in. The 3-door SUV space and the pickup segment represent very large pools of demand. And of course, across those large pools of demand, there's a range of prices, but this is a really important element for us, is just recognizing how much overall demand potential there is, and we're seeing with increased awareness and excitement for the brand that translate to lots and lots of new EV customers.
The other thing which is worth just bringing up in the context of some of the negotiations that we've had with R1, is the bill of material cost reductions we're seeing, and these are significant, and we're going to see them quarter-over-quarter. I've described the performance like this staircase set of changes quarter-over-quarter, with a big step being that which comes in quarter 2 of next year. But we've been able to leverage suppliers excitement for R2 to achieve materially lower costs in our bill of materials that will start to layer in along with what comes in Q2, but even beyond that.
And so R2 is sort of this incredible carat for suppliers. And one of the things that's become very clear, particularly in the last 2 to 3 quarters is just how well the Rivian brand is resonating, and suppliers are recognizing relative to some of the other customers, just how much volume we're delivering and how much demand there is for our products, relative to a wide variety of established brands, and they recognize that, that excitement for our brand will also translate to lower price points. And the R2 captures the essence of our brand, but of course, to a smaller package and at a much lower price point. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You reiterated your view to be gross margin positive in 2024, but I'm hoping to better understand if you're views in how Rivian will get there, have changed at all recently, given the volatility in the industry more broadly with competitors cutting EV vehicle prices, but also costs falling in Rivian, as you've described, making so much progress on its own cost structure. Thanks, Mark. I'll let Claire jump in on this as well. This is just such an important topic. And ultimately, there's -- I just spoke to it a bit, but there's a few major levers.
The first being, the continued ramp-up of our production facility and the fixed cost absorption that comes with that. We're seeing the benefits of that quarter-over-quarter as we continue to ramp. So it's numerically very easy to understand.
The second, which is maybe less -- it's not as easy to see without having a look into all of our supplier negotiations and discussions is the significant progress we're making contractually with redefining build material costs or material costs through negotiations with suppliers, through resourcing of new suppliers, or through changes to the component or system design to achieve those cost reductions. And the shutdown that we have in second quarter of next year of 2024, will allow us to implement a large bundling of all of those changes, both in terms of suppliers, part design changes, component changes. I've talked about this a lot in the past, but massive consolidation of our ECU topology, massive simplification of our harness, simplification of our body structure, simplification of the HVAC system in the vehicle. So there's big changes that are going to be coming as part of that shutdown.
And we saw similar -- it's worth noting with the commercial vehicle, with the EDV, when we had the shutdown earlier this year, we had a 35% reduction in our material costs associated with the consolidated set of changes we made with that shutdown. So we're expecting and anticipating a similar level of step change in our material costs following the shutdown.
And then lastly, which I spoke to a moment ago is growth in ASP. And that's going to be both due to the layering in or the feathering in of new pricing, which again, we'll just see quarter-over-quarter as more and more of our deliveries are associated with new pricing, meaning post-March 1, 2022, as we work through that. And then the other is the introduction of some of these new trim packages, Max Pack, is an example,  we have some new trim configurations going to be coming out next year that will also help us grow ASP. So it's a combination of ramp, material cost and ASP that give us a very high degree of confidence in our long-term gross margin for the business. And my follow-up was on a related topic on margins. Last quarter, you spoke about your expectation for R1 to be contribution margin positive exiting this year. Is that still your expectation? Mark, we still expect R1 to be contribution margin positive exiting this year for newly priced units. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Sorry to follow on the same topic. But if we -- I wanted to look at that sort of the shape of the gross profit progression as we think about next year.
And so in just paraphrasing, could we think about this minus 30 -- 2000 per vehicle, as sort of linearly getting better in Q4 and Q1? And then obviously, there's a big step change. You talked about all of the massive improvements in the architecture of Q2. You have some re-ramp in Q3. So I don't want to put -- it's going to be a more complex number.
But coming out of Q3 into Q4, that's where we should start to really see the gross profit ramp probably well through positive because then, obviously, you have targets in 2025 that include double-digit gross profit. Does that sound like a shape where you get a big change out of the Q2, Q3 into Q4 because that's where a large amount of the architecture costs change out? Yes. So Chris, as you think about the near-term cadence, one area I wanted to just call out is, as I mentioned in Rob's question, EDV was a significant contributor to our Q3 margin improvement itself. And so as you look to Q4, given the seasonality of Amazon's business, that will be a fraction of the volume that they took in Q3 of this year. And so you won't see this linear path from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the gross profit losses per unit, they are just given some of the mix shift.
As you look to Q1, you'll see more similar types of dynamics, especially as you start to ramp up greater volumes of our Enduro Drive units, where you're seeing some of the new technology introductions that we have in R1, you'll see the benefits of Max Pack as well, throughout the course of Q4 and Q1, that are contributing to the cost down road map for.
And then as you mentioned, if you were to just look at the material cost trajectory, that's where you'll see the significant step change, really in the second half of 2024, as each of the new technologies that we'll be introducing will start to go into production in the line as well. And so that's going to be that step change in terms of gross margin improvement.
However, that step change will be mitigated by some volume-related impacts given our production rates for Q2 and Q3. And so Q4 is where you'll see more of the run rate potential coming out of the shutdown itself, and the full complement of material cost downs included within the vehicles themselves. Makes sense. So there's a lot of moving parts. But basically, if we think about next year, there's a Q1 clean quarter, and Q4, obviously, clean, again, there will be the EDV issues then. But basically, it all comes out of Q4. So okay, in terms of the shape, that all makes sense.
One of the areas you've also been really improving upon has been on the OpEx side. And I'm just curious how do we think about if we run rate going into next year, when do we have to start to build in some OpEx for Georgia prework, some obviously can be capitalized. But do we have to start to build in an OpEx investment as I think about for '24. As you think about the OpEx drivers, you'll start to see Georgia pick up in '24. But beyond that, you'll also see more material investments as we approach the 2024 shutdown to introduce new technology. So as our team today is increasing the number of prototypes we're building in advance of the shutdown and increasing the level of engineering, design and development work that we're doing with our supply partners for those new technology introductions, you're seeing a little bit of a tick up of R&D that you'll see throughout the second half of this year and into the first half of next year itself.
But in aggregate, we don't expect a material increase. We'll certainly see some continued increases across the board, but we'll continue to maintain sort of the slight increased level that we've seen of late over the longer term. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. So it's exciting to hear that you'll be able to sell the commercial vehicles to other customers. I was wondering if you can try and help us with a directional sense of volume split between that and the Amazon one, and also timing. So after the reweight next year, you'll have, I think, 65,000 units of capacity for the -- in the commercial vehicles. How quickly or around what time line do you think that you would be able to essentially fill that capacity between your current customers and any new one? As I spoke to before, the sales process for commercial customers really, is that relatively long sort of lead time process whereby it's important for these large fleet operators to run pilot programs, both to understand the unique idiosyncrasies of the vehicle, but also to understand what changes are necessary from an infrastructure point of view.
And as is often the case, where the vehicles will be based out of their ""hub"", wasn't originally designed with a lot of power. So it doesn't have necessarily power to support daily charging or night charging of the vehicles. And that takes time to install that. We've learned this -- some of the challenges associated with converting existing facilities to support large EV fleets. We've learned this through the lens of our relationship with Amazon very quickly.
And so those pilot programs, which will be kicking off, we'll be announcing a number of them shortly, will lead to larger volumes, but we want to be careful to just set expectations in the right way that these pilot programs will take some time. And so we think of this as some volume associated with both the pilots and orders that come following the pilots in 2024, but the significant opportunity really starts to kick in, in 2025, as these larger customers transition from pilot to at scale development. Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is on CapEx. So obviously, quite a big cut again to this year's guidance. I think you've mentioned among other factors, timing delays. I guess historically when you've lowered the CapEx over the last few quarters or so, there was no real increase in CapEx for the future periods. But how should we think about this particular cost? Like, are you going to see something next year in terms of CapEx at higher than what you previously contemplated or in the end, leave it at your regular framework? So Emmanuel, what we've talked about in the past has been approximately $2 billion or on average, between '23 and '24. I'd say that we'll be in a position to be below that average, just slightly below that average, if you think about the trajectory and the significance of cuts that we've had in 2023 itself. It's really been driven by both some improvements that we've had in terms of longer-dated payment terms, on some of the work that we're doing within our production facility and with our equipment purchases, as well as the episodic nature of some of our investments, predominantly surrounding the shutdown and introduction of new technologies that's really the largest contributor to the reductions that we've made this year that will hit in the early part of '24. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. If I look at gross profit ex the LCNRV, it's trending, I think, close to $38,000 a vehicle, and that has improved a lot from Q1, where I think it was close to [ $80,000 ], but still quite a big gap to get to the gross profit. I mean I think in Q1, you kind of framed like a certain percent was leverage, certain price, service engineering, certain price downs. Any sort of framework how we get from the sort of 38,000 today to the breakeven, what are sort of the main drivers from here? Is it mostly the pricing and engineering at this point? Or is there still some leverage or? So the 3 drivers remain as you think about them being the fixed cost leverage that we'll get from increased volume from current state to the end of '24, as well as the material cost down trajectory and improvements in average selling price as a whole. .
As you look at the progress that we've made over the course of this year, that's largely been driven by the improvements that we've seen in fixed cost leverage from the production ramp, as well as the progress that we've been making on material costs, given the technologies we've introduced in EDV, which RJ referenced, resulted in a 35% improvement in our material cost in the EDV itself, and then continued progress against, both the introduction of new technologies such as the Dual-Motor introductions that we've had in R1.
And then beyond that, we've also continued to see progress, as RJ mentioned, in the visibility that we have today in our contractual agreements with supplier partners that are continuing to come down as we look both to the business in the future.
The other key that we've seen has been around the commodities environment and backdrop. And to date, you're not really seeing the softness in some of the key battery cell raw materials are reflected in our current results. So some of that trajectory is still to come as you think about impacts for the end of this year and into 2024 as well. I think Claire and I both spoke to this, but it's important to call out, when we talk about material cost reductions and pulling overall our BOM costs down, These are contractual, meaning, this isn't like, us sitting over here, hoping that this is going to come down. These are detailed contractual negotiations, part by part, supplier by supplier, and the effectivity data in some of these where it's, let's say, just a pure negotiation on a part that's not going to change or on a supply that's not going to change, we've been able to accelerate the effectivity date to have already happened or to be happening prior to the shutdown in Q2 of 2024.
But for some of the larger changes and things like, let's say, for example, the significant consolidation of ECUs that were driving or the massive refactoring harness that takes roughly 25% of the harness length out. Those involve engineering changes that involve new suppliers and completely new supplier contracts. And so the bundling of some of those big multi-thousand dollar changes that have effectivity dates in April, it's -- we have the 100% confidence those are going to occur. Those are, again, I'm using the word here is -- clearly, again, these are contractual agreements. But the contractual agreements have an effectivity date and they tie to when we start production with those new components.
So as we look at this transition, the continued ramp, as I said earlier, that's -- we understand the -- that's just the numerics of fixed cost absorption. And on the BOM cost side, it's just understanding what -- I understand it's hard for all of you to see, but very clear for us to see the contractual obligations that we've negotiated with all of our suppliers. I guess I think in Q1, you had kind of indicated half of the gap was leverage and then it was like a quarter price, and then 1/4 is supplier and engineering. At this point where you have already cut it in half, I mean how should we think between those 3 items? Is it now equally 1/3, 1/3 each of what's going to drive that closing that gap? I guess I was trying to gauge the size of what's left. Colin, we're not going to provide an update specifically to the bridge that we had commented on. But as I mentioned, the significance in the progress that we've seen to date has really been driven by fixed cost leverage from production ramp and some of the progress in our material cost-down trajectory. So you can extrapolate that to understand those sort of relative reweighting of those 3 key drivers for us. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy with Truth Securities. It's Henry on for Jordan here. Just had a quick one around some of the current micro news on EV demand. I just want to get a sense of any small changes in your thinking around the launch of R2, timing, et cetera, due to this? Or do you think the backdrop for EV is, be substantially improved by the time it rolls out in 2026? Ultimately, as we look at, I'd say, broadly beyond even R2, just at the space, I think there is an overreaction to some of the short-term headwinds, short or medium-term headwinds we see between interest rates being at record high levels. And of course, those aren't going to drop down anytime in the next month or 2, but this is something that will recover over time, and some of the geopolitical challenges that we have across the world.
So if you look at R2 launching in 2026, everything about our R2 in terms of its ability to -- and our deep confidence in its ability to capture the essence of our brand. We're enormously excited about the product, but to do it at a price point that's considerably lower than what we have in R1 and at a form factor, a size that makes it sort of fit from an addressable market point of view, fit the largest segment in the United States.
We couldn't be more excited and bullish on this product. And we think the timing of it works out beautifully, in terms of the brand buildup that we're driving with R1, and off the back of that to then have a product that is sized physically in terms of its footprint, as well as priced such that it can really capture the hearts and minds of buyers but also give customers a real choice. There's an extreme vacuum of choice we feel in the sort of $45,000 to $50,000 price range for midsize SUVs. There's just not a lot of great options. And as a result, we see very highly concentrated market share with Tesla, but we believe there's a need for alternatives, and those alternatives need to be very robustly developed, with vertically integrated software electronics and deeply seamless user experience, user interface, which is, of course, what we're developing with R2. And then kind of just piggybacking off the software space, could you just update us again on some of the monetization opportunities you all see in the software segment kind of into next year and then kind of longer term? We've spoken about this before, but we really believe in terms of the large-scale opportunities to monetize, I think the most -- the model that we think is going to fit and has shown to fit the most is around autonomy. And as we look at higher levels of autonomy, the ability to charge for that. And there's a variety of ways that can be done, monthly payments, as well as upfront payment for access to a higher level of autonomy.
We do think there's been an over there's been over -- it's been overestimated how much vehicle manufacturers can charge for every software feature. So the way that we think about it is, the features that have a lot of complexity and require a lot of development, autonomy being a great example of that, some of what we think of -- as some of the really interesting immersive user experiences, particularly as you start to think about AR, and the way that the vehicle can interact with its environment. We think those represent opportunities for an incremental charge above and beyond the base platform.
But like the idea of charging for heated seats or charging for sort of a binary 1 or 0 like turning a feature on and off, we don't think that, that's going to land well with consumers, and we don't think that that's going to be a sustained model for charging for software. We think it really ties to the much more complex, much more heavy development platforms. Our last question is from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Perfect. Was wondering if you could give us an update on your battery strategy. I know that historically, you've been working in-house, potentially and having your own chemistry, your own sell. You've spoken relatively favorably about LFP. Any changes in your thinking there about what you're doing now and also looking forward to R2? So this is a space that's rapidly evolving. And as we if we look out over the next decade, one of the things that's become very clear through both the lens of policy, but also through the lens of securing long-term supply, is the upstream supply of some of the raw materials. So lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, of course, nickel, thinking also very much and more recently about graphite. And each of these upstream raw materials has different implications around the cell manufacturing itself. So something like graphite, of course, has very closely tied relation to the anode chemistry, whereas, let's say, lithium hydroxide is a little bit more commoditized and easier to integrate into a downstream supply.
And so where we've been spending a lot of time is building a very robust strategy around each of the components of the cell and each of the raw materials of the cell from an upstream relationship point of view, and also making sure that those upstream relationships and the way we want to engage with those upstream suppliers integrates with the way we've structured our deals with battery cell suppliers, and in the case of R2, this is really important given the role that IRA is going to play, in terms of driving advantaged pricing with the consumer-facing tax credit and the effect that, that will have in terms of consumer behavior.
So we're incredibly focused on upstream supply. I also think that the last 18 months have been a really challenging environment in that, particularly if you think about what happened in 2022 and into the beginning of 2023, where there was, I would say, a lot of bad deals done in the upstream raw material supply, where people are overpaying and inflating the market and it made it hard to do a good deal. We sort of watched some of that play out. And I'd say in the aftermath of some of that exuberance, there's now a lot more rational deals that are on the table in terms of securing some of that upstream supply of raw materials. Great. Okay. That was going to be my next question. So I guess maybe one last one, just a simple one. How many pre-March 1st orders do you still have in the backlog, presumably, there shouldn't be very -- many of them left, at what point is that going to be completely cleaned? Alex, we'll continue to work through the pre-March 1st preorder base as a whole. And as we've talked about in the past, they'll be feathered in both new orders as well as pre-March 1st orders, especially as we expand our production to include more Dual-Motor units, which weren't available to those pre-March 1st consumers originally, and will introduce Max Pack, and there's a variety of new introductions over the course of 2024 as well. So you'll continue to see both new orders, as well as our pre-March 1st preorders feathered in together. I'd now like to turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe, for closing remarks. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We've spent the -- at the time, over the last quarter, really continue to focus on things we've said, we're going to focus on driving up production volume and achieving better fixed cost leverage, achieving meaningful reductions in our material costs from a bill of materials point of view, working on building out our commercial and go-to-market operations to allow us to, not only continue driving demand, but to continue driving up our ASPs. And importantly, focused on developing our next set of products around the R2 platform, which, as you heard me say, we couldn't be more excited about and really looking forward to showing to the world in the early part of next year.
As we now look out and particularly with all the discussion around long-term EV penetration and the timing for EV penetration, I want to just end by saying, we remain deeply convicted around the transition of the entirety of our transportation space, and we're committed to building customers -- or building products that our customers absolutely love, and building a brand around those products that continues to resonate across a variety of price points in a variety of form factors, which, of course, the R2 platform will really help deliver on.
So with that, thank you, everyone, for joining. Look forward to our next call. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the Rivian Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions, reflect management's views as of today.
We will also be making statements related to our business, operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments during the fourth quarter, provide an update on the progress we're making against our value drivers and discuss steps Rivian is taking to adapt to evolving market conditions in our industry.
Before I dive in, as part of our ongoing focus on driving cost efficiency, we announced internally today the difficult decision to reduce the number of salaried employees by approximately 10%. These difficult decisions, among other initiatives I plan to discuss, enable us to maximize the amount of impact we can have as a company.
We hold the deep conviction that the entire automotive industry will electrify over the long term. This means, as an industry, replacing roughly 1.5 billion internal combustion passenger cars across the planet over the next couple of decades. Rivian's mission is to accelerate this transition. A major goal with the launch of R1 was to build a brand that deeply resonates with customers.
Beyond our active owner groups and the R1S being the top-selling EV in the U.S. priced over $70,000, an owner satisfaction survey conducted by consumer reports showed Rivian as the #1 automotive brand with the highest likelihood for customers to purchase again. We intend to harness this brand strength as we launch R2, which will be unveiling on March 7. R2 represents the essence of our brand while targeting the significant midsized SUV segment, a massive market with limited compelling EV options beyond Tesla.
R2 has been developed with vertically integrated propulsion platforms, electronics and software to create an incredible user experience. Our team is laser focused on the factors within our control that will drive Rivian's long-term value. These include driving cost efficiency, optimizing our production deliveries, investing in differentiating technologies, enhancing the Rivian customer experience and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
The progress we've made ramping production and driving greater cost efficiency was significant in 2023. During the full year, we more than doubled production and deliveries and exceeded our initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles. The team achieved this while also successfully managing complex integration of new engineering design changes, including our in-house drive units for both the EDV and R1 platforms, LFP battery packs for EDV and new vehicle variants such as our Max pack.
Ramping production and introducing new technologies across multiple vehicle platforms has presented challenges, but importantly, our team has gained significant learnings in a compressed time frame. This experience will be foundational as we execute against our 2024 plan.
We took significant steps towards driving greater efficiency in 2023. Gross profit per vehicle improved by approximately $81,000 when comparing the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022. As we start 2024, I want to emphasize our team's continued sense of urgency and ownership mindset in driving further efficiency throughout the organization.
During our second quarter shutdown, we plan to incorporate additional material cost downs with the integration of new design and engineering changes in the R1 platform, deliver further supplier cost reductions, capture the flow-through of commodity price improvements and further optimize our manufacturing expenses. We believe these steps position us to achieve modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024.
As we start 2024, I want to address the broader industry context, which I referred to during our third quarter call. Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impact demand. In this fluid environment, we appreciate the expressed interest in demand visibility from the investment community.
The conversion of orders to sales can be impacted by several factors, including delivery timing, location of order, monthly payments and customer readiness. Our order bank has notably reduced over time as deliveries have more than doubled in 2023 versus 2022, along with the impact of cancellations due to both the macro environment and the customer factors I just referenced.
For 2024, we expect our total deliveries to be derived from our existing backlog as well as new orders generated during the year. Our key focus is on increasing demand to achieve our 2024 delivery targets.
Our go-to-market strategy is built on growing brand awareness, enabling our direct-to-consumer experience and importantly, providing more opportunities for consumers to experience our award-winning R1T and R1S vehicles firsthand. We are scaling our Rivian spaces program, which are equivalent of retail locations. And today, we have 11 sites open across North America, most of which have opened in the last 6 months.
These sites have garnered over 130,000 visitors so far in 2024. Complementing our spaces footprint are more than 50 service centers serve as another location for current and potential customers to experience our vehicles. We provided over 13,000 demo drives already in the first quarter and consider this to be one of our key demand building strategies.
We've also expanded the lineup of our vehicles and recently introduced our standard range variant, which provides an accessible price point for more potential Rivian customers. We're encouraged by the early results.
The steps we're taking in 2024 will be foundational in positioning Rivian as a leader in the transition to electrification. The opportunity ahead is significant. We're taking deliberate action to drive additional cost efficiency as we continue building our go-to-market capabilities and develop our R2 platform. I would like to thank all of those who continue to support our vision, including employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders.
With that, I'll pass the call to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I'd like to reiterate our excitement for the long-term success of Rivian. Over the course of 2023, we made significant progress in all 4 key value drivers: driving greater cost efficiency, continuing to optimize production and deliveries, investing in differentiated technologies, and continuing to enhance the Rivian customer experience.
During the fourth quarter, we produced 17,541 vehicles and delivered 13,972 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $1.3 billion of revenue we generated. Total revenue for the quarter included $39 million of proceeds from the sale of regulatory credits. We expect the sale of regulatory credits to increase over time, but to vary quarter-to-quarter.
For the full year 2023, we produced 57,232 vehicles, which was significantly above our initial guidance of 50,000 vehicles and more than double 2022 production. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $606 million. Gross profit per vehicle delivered was approximately negative $43,000.
During the fourth quarter, cost of goods sold were negatively impacted by $70 million of costs primarily associated with our planned 2024 shutdown were approximately $5,000 per vehicle delivered. These costs include supplier-related expenses, accelerated depreciation and other expenses related to the new technology and cost savings design changes going into the R1 platform.
While we could incur additional costs associated with the planned shutdown in technology and design changes in the near term, we do not anticipate these costs to be part of our normal course of business in the longer term.
During the fourth quarter, we also delivered a higher proportion of consumer vehicles due to Amazon's expected seasonality. For context, the proportion of our total revenue attributed to Amazon was 8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 30% in the third quarter of 2023.
Given our commercial vans have lower material costs due to the technology changes made in 2023, the lower delivery during the quarter negatively impacted our gross margin. In addition, due to this dynamic, the vast majority of the increase in finished goods inventory in the fourth quarter of 2023 was related to commercial vans. Changes in LCNRV and losses on firm purchase commitments benefited our fourth quarter results by $7 million as compared to $106 million in the third quarter of 2023, a difference of approximately $6,300 per delivered unit on a quarter sequential basis.
Next, I want to help provide more clarity on how we bridge from our fourth quarter 2023 results to where we expect to reach modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024. The largest driver, which represents approximately 50% of the bridge, is our plan to reduce our variable cost per unit. The majority of this will be accomplished through material cost reductions planned as part of our Q2 2024 shutdown. As a reminder, this is through engineering cost reductions such as our ECU and wire harness simplification through our commercially negotiated cost downs and contribution from lower raw material costs.
The second driver, representing approximately 35% of the bridge, is through our focus on driving greater efficiency through our production facility. As part of our planned shutdown, we are increasing the R1 line rate by approximately 30% to more efficiently produce vehicles. We also expect to see a benefit from declining LCNRV and firm purchase commitment balances in 2024.
The final piece of the bridge, which represents approximately 15%, is the scaling of our nonvehicle revenue. With over 70,000 Rivians on the road, we have the opportunity for increased revenue areas such as regulatory credits, accessories, service, remarketing and software-enabled services. These drivers are core to our long-term margin targets, and we expect to continue to drive recurring revenues in these areas as the car park grows and we expand our offerings.
Our adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $706 million. For the full year, our adjusted operating expenses of $2.7 billion represented 2.5% growth versus 2022 despite our production and delivery volumes more than doubling over the same period.
As RJ mentioned earlier, we are in the process of optimizing our operating expenditures by reducing our salaried employees by approximately 10%, along with a limited number of nonmanufacturing hourly employees. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $1.1 billion. For the full year, our EBITDA was just under our guidance of negative $4 billion.
Turning to our business outlook for 2024. We remain focused on driving greater cost efficiency across the company. We are guiding to 57,000 total vehicles produced for the year. Compared to 2023, we anticipate consumer and commercial vehicle deliveries to grow by low single digits.
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we expect to shut down both the consumer and commercial lines in our normal plant for several weeks during the second quarter to introduce cost savings in vehicle technologies to the R1 platform. We believe these changes will meaningfully reduce our material costs and position Rivian to exit 2024 with a much improved margin profile. While the direct downtime will be over a portion of Q2, we anticipate this to impact all 4 quarters of output as we prepare the facility for the work and then individually ramp each vehicle variant as well as our supply chain following the shutdown.
As for the first quarter of 2024, due to managing changes in our supply chain associated with the introduction of new materials, we expect to factory-gate approximately 13,500 units for the quarter. We expect that there will be a few thousand more vehicles, which are built but not factory-gated as they wait an updated part we expect to receive in April. We anticipate the first quarter total delivery to be approximately 10% to 15% below the fourth quarter 2023 deliveries.
While the incorporation of new design changes impact near-term production, we are confident it better positions Rivian to be more profitable and competitive over the long term. We expect 2024 EBITDA to be negative $2.7 billion as we focus on continuing our go-to-market infrastructure build-out and the development of R2, while also optimizing our costs driven by the integration of key new engineering technology and design changes, negotiated supplier cost downs and a more efficient operating expense structure.
Recently, we have taken measures to rationalize our capital expenditures due to a greater focus on our core business. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be $1.75 billion, driven by additional investments in our production facilities, next-generation technologies and the continued build-out of our go-to-market operations.
We remain confident that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments can fund our operations through 2025. We aim to maintain a strong balance sheet position by continuing to drive cost efficiencies and improve our vehicle unit economics while opportunistically evaluating a variety of capital markets available to Rivian ranging across the capital structure.
Over the long term, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Just a question on the downtime relative to -- on the R1 versus the launch of the R2. And RJ, just curious, is it maybe better to focus on pulling forward the launch of the R2 and committing capital, both human and dollars to pulling that forward and getting that high-volume program up and running as opposed to tinkering with the line on the R1 and maybe circling back to that R1 line leader? Is that possible? Or is there kind of constraints or just kind of misguided and these things can both happen at the same time and you can't pull for the R2 forward at all? Yes. Thanks, John. We're certainly working very hard to make sure we deliver R2 on time and to the extent possible, any time we can out of the program. I think what has us so excited about but R2 is if we look at the success of R1 in terms of how the markets responded to the brand and to the product, it's the top-selling EV with a price point of over $70,000. And our hope, of course, is to translate the brand strength that we've demonstrated for Rivian with R1 into the R2 product and into a much lower price segment, which has a very large just market.
I think the key thing, though, to come back to your question, R1, is just recognizing how much of the content that's going into the shutdown in Q2 actually translates to R2. So there's a massive consolidation of our ECUs in the vehicle. So that's all the computers in the vehicle, which we design and engineer in house. We've consolidated them. We reduced the number of computers by about 65%. And that network architecture and associated ECU topology is very closely related to what's in R2. And so it not only derisks R2, but it's part of the development process and development sequence associated with the launch of that product.
Along with that, these changes that we're making to R1 with regards to just the overall changing out of hundreds of components and associated suppliers with those components also corresponds to a number of supplier engagements that we have that linked to R2. And the volume that R2 brings allows us to be more aggressive in pricing with a number of those suppliers that are on the R1 program. So the 2 are very much interlinked. And with that said, as we think about our focus as a business, the shutdown and the updates associated with it in our bill of materials and along with the line really is sort of part 1 to the major focus for us of the business, which is the successful launch and rapid ramp-up of the R2 production. And just one follow-up. If you think about product cadence in spacing of product, do you feel like the tack that the Tesla is taking of a product launch that's relatively sparse but constant improvement is more appropriate in the direction you're heading? Or do you think something closer to sort of a typical sort of 4- to 5-year product life cycle with many products interspersed is the way you're ultimately going to land as we kind of look 5 to 10 years in the future? Yes. When we think about it from a customer point of view, one of the things we see is most valued is making sure that the platform -- the vehicle platform and architecture allows for a continuous stream of updates. And so in the R1 product, the customer satisfaction is extremely high. The brand strength is high, with the consumer reports rates us as having the highest level of brand equity, if you will, where the likelihood of repurchase is the highest for our brand. And a lot of that is borne out of the continued updates we're making through over the year of software improvements.
And so we think that's a really dramatic shift in just how we think about products and sort of overall vehicle life cycle. That will translate, of course, into R2. And as we look at the launch of R2, learning from what we went through in launching R1 with R1T, R1S and also the commercial vans all in parallel, we've really simplified the product portfolio cadence with R2 where there's a single vehicle that we're launching, the number of build combinations and trim combinations is very limited with an emphasis on managing rapid ramp-up of the supply chain and driving operational efficiency into the R2 plan. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. My first question is how much of the volume that you forecast for this year is preordered versus what you would expect to be sold out of inventory? And I have a follow-up. Thanks, Adam. The -- our backlog is something that we know there's been questions around just what does that look like? What's the topology of it. One of the things we need to recognize is a lot of the customers that are in our backlog have been there for a number of years. And as a result, it's not as if the moment someone gets to the front of the line, so to speak, and they're -- we're ready to make a delivery to them that they can take delivery at that moment. Life situation in terms of when they're ready to take on a new vehicle, the coordination of that around what their financing expectations are, all of those factors play in.
And so the way to think about our backlog is to recognize that this will be -- this will continue to exist through the remainder of this year. But in parallel to delivering vehicles from our backlog, we'll also be delivering vehicles from newer orders, orders that are happening over the course of this year. And so that for us is a transition as a business where we go from purely delivering from backlog to having folks that are coming in, new demand and having those deliveries happen much quicker. And to help facilitate that transition, we've created a few customer-facing structures that make that a little easier.
We've created something we call the R1 shop, which allows some of the more common build combinations to be put in there to allow customers to get access to those vehicles more quickly. And still, to this day, one of the most common questions we get from customers is how quickly can I get my vehicle. And so managing that dynamic of customers wanting to have the immediate gratification of they buy a vehicle, they get it within a week or 2, along with customers that have been waiting for, in some cases, 2 or 3 years. That balance has been something we're learning to navigate and we do expect to continue to have to manage that balance over the course of the year. Okay. And just as a follow-up, the EV world has changed so much, RJ, since the 2021 IPO in a lot of ways, in a more moderated demand and competitiveness and pretty uncertain economic environment to boot. So I'm just wondering how the Board and the management team, are you still fully committed to that vertical integrated, go to Georgia, 400,000 units, $5 billion on your own strategy? Or has the board consider any alternative to the greenfield option in Georgia or at least some adjustments in terms of the size or whether you go in with a partner? Or is it pretty much the strategy for 2021 that you're kind of going ahead with right now into '24. Thanks, Adam. The way we've approached our Georgia facility is to build out the plant across 2 phases. So it's not a single 400,000 unit block but rather two 200,000 unit blocks. I think the broader point that you raised just around overall demand for electric vehicles, how fast the market transitions to electric vehicles, we do think we're in a very interesting moment in time where there is a lack of choice of highly compelling EV products in that $45,000 to $55,000 price range, recognizing the average price of a new vehicle transaction in the United States last year was around $48,000.
And so when we look at the competition that exists, we often get immediately drawn into competing what's the competition look like directly with Tesla. But we need to recognize only 7% of the market has electrified, meaning really, we're talking about how do we get the 93% of the market that's not buying an EV to get excited about the product. And R2 -- the layout of the vehicle, the package, the configuration, the technology content, we think, creates a really interesting and very unique configuration that we're very bullish in the demand for that product. And of course, recognizing what we've seen in R1 and how strong Rivian has resonated with consumers there.
We remain very bullish on the R2 segment and the R2 product itself. And so the way that we've engaged with our suppliers to ensure that we can ramp effectively as well as laying out the production road map, albeit measured, as I described across 2 phases, has been very much thoughtful of the scale of the opportunity and the scale of this transition that we see happening over the course of this decade. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Just on the workforce reduction, sort of obviously some tough decisions. But -- and I know, Claire and RJ, you've sort of been really focused on the gross profitability. But maybe if we could just sort of focus a little bit on OpEx because -- and I understand you're cutting the workforce by 10% here, but how do you get comfortable that this is -- that even now that is sort of the right level because ex stock comp in '23, it's just under $3 billion if -- I know it's a different world. But if I look at like where Tesla was at a sort of similar level of sales back in 2015, you're still like 80% above that. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on sort of OpEx and the plans there going forward. Thanks, Joe. Yes, when we think about OpEx, there's a number of components here. So just to break apart the big category of it all. If we look first at R&D -- if we at look at between R&D and SG&A, on the R&D side, we have to recognize comparing to Tesla in 2015, while useful -- and certainly when we look at these types of metrics internally as well. We're not competing against Tesla in 2015. We're competing against Tesla and others in 2024. And so we're driving incredible focus on efficiency and how we develop our products.
We talk internally about being the most efficient at turning capital into amazing products. But it does also require us to be spending appropriately in the core areas. And for us, there's a few areas that we've made the decision to develop vertically in-house to create what we believe to be significant structural long-term advantages, and that's really around the electronic stack in the vehicle, so the ECU and computer topology throughout the vehicle. The software, of course, that's running on those computers across the vehicle and then our high-voltage architecture. So that's our high-voltage battery system, all the way through the rest of the driveline, so through the drive unit out to the wheels.
And it's in those areas that we see both technical differentiation that creates really a consumer experience that's markedly different and better than what we believe a sourced third-party strategy will deliver. But it also provides meaningful cost advantages. And in the compute stack and ECU topology front, the biggest opportunity here is ECU consolidation and the ability to have a much smaller number of computers that run the vehicle. And of course, because we control and design those computers, it allows us much more seamlessly to do that. So that's first on the R&D front, a big focus, as I said, has been on driving efficiency into that.
Now we think of R&D as entirely spending within our employee base, but a big portion of this is also with suppliers. And it has to do with the supplier development costs associated with, let's say, a seat program for the R2 or headlights for the R2. And so a lot of the negotiations that are being driven, I referenced this earlier, around R1 supply also linked to much more strategic long-term relationships with our suppliers that will feed into R2, where we're asking those suppliers to treat us much more like partners where instead of having to pay the suppliers so much upfront, which is a lot of what we've dealt with historically to those suppliers recognizing and clearly seeing the market strength that we have.
I mean these suppliers are providing all of our competitors, and they see our volumes relative to our competitors, especially with R1 seeing it's really dominant position from a market share point of view. That's helped a lot. And completely changing the nature of those discussions with suppliers, which -- of course, we think about it. We talk about a lot in the context of COGS, but it really does impact us on the OpEx side through the prelaunch development costs.
Now with that said, I do want to just spend a moment here on SG&A because it's the other big driver of our OpEx, of course. And on this front, we're at a point where we're building out a service network. We're building out good sales and distribution network. And a number of these areas today are recognized as OpEx. In particular, on the service side, almost all of this is OpEx. But over time, of course, our service costs become part of our COGS structure. And in fact, service will ultimately be a profitable part of the business.
And so Claire referenced this, and we can certainly speak to it more here. We're very focused on not minimizing the growth of our SG&A spend as we continue to scale the business. So while the business is scaling and the number of vehicles we're supporting in the field grows dramatically over the next couple of years, we're working very hard to really maintain a lean SG&A side of the organization, and that has the tailwind of a lot of those costs that are embedded in SG&A today, as I said, becoming COGS and actually becoming profitable. Okay. And then maybe just on CapEx. I think last quarter, you sort of talked about a '23, '24 average, below $2 billion. And I guess that's technically true, but it's pretty significantly below $2 billion now with the 175 guidance. So was there -- is there sort of a further shift in capital spending? And if so, what does that relate to? Sure. As we think about the broader context, first and foremost, as you heard RJ talk about, we're focused on driving efficiency across the entire company as a whole. And so as we look at what we've been able to achieve, given these efforts across the company, it's allowed us or enabled us to not just shift out CapEx, but dramatically reduce the required CapEx within the business as a whole. And so that's by pressurizing the areas of investment, whether it's how efficient we're able to invest in some of the rerate activities in normal and taking CapEx out there, whether it's, as RJ mentioned, engaging with suppliers around product tooling investments, whether it's continuing to tweak around the efficiency of all of our go-to-market operations' investments between sales and service locations as well as all of our enterprise tech and logistics infrastructure as well.
And so I think what you're seeing from us is, it's really just continuing to drive that mentality of efficiency and culture of efficiency across not just CapEx, but really our operating expenses, how we're managing our cost of goods sold and equally as we're thinking through the way in which we'll manage our inventory balances as well, which are our 4 key focuses across the business. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. There's a comment in your release about the 2024 forecast requiring an improvement in the order rate and you said it's going to be driven by planned go-to-market strategies. I wanted to ask about that. Is it reasonable to assume that the Q1 deliveries that you're projecting here is kind of reflective of the current order run rates, around 12,000 or 135 a day. What is the impact that you're seeing from some of the strategies you've unveiled like the standard variance in leasing? And can you talk a little bit about how you're going to get the word out or advertise what you're offering? Sure. Well, thanks, Rod. Yes, you referenced it, but it's important to note here, we've just recently launched our Standard pack variant, which we've long talked about, but ultimately, it's now available to customers. And we're really encouraged by the reaction to that and some of the early read through on just what that does in terms of demand generation.
It's also worth noting and implicit in your question is a key element here, which is the Center pack has not only driven demand for our more price-sensitive customers, but it's actually increased. We've seen an increase in demand for our Quad Large pack as well. And that really links to the continued growth and awareness for what we're building.
And when we think about how strong our customers like the product and how the brand excitement for customers has been so high with the likelihood of repurchase being by significantly the highest across the entire auto industry. It's really a key element for us in terms of driving knowledge of the brands, knowledge of the products and driving awareness up. And so with that said, a lot of the investment that I was referring to in the letter and in my opening comments has to do with building out more of our go-to-market infrastructure.
Today, we have 11 spaces. We have just over 50 service locations. We're now offering test drives through our service locations along with some of those spaces, but getting customers in our vehicles is by far, the way -- the most effective way to not only drive brand awareness but to convert that brand -- that experience into actual vehicle orders and vehicle sales. And so a lot of activity is going to be playing out over the course of the next few months to continue building up these functional capabilities within the business and also the infrastructure associated with supporting physical interaction with the products. Okay. just given what you're seeing right now, can you discuss the rationale behind expanding the capacity by 30% and -- at the end of this year? And any update on EDV demand outside of Amazon? Yes. And within the plant, the shutdown we have coming in the second quarter -- next quarter, I think a lot of the thinking around that tends to drive towards what's happening in the plant. And I said it before, but just to repeat here for clarity.
One of the most important parts of the shutdown is actually what's happening within our supply chain. So we're making a number of supplier changes, a number of component changes along with supplier changes that lead to significant reductions in our material cost. And the scale and amount of change in our supply chain and through our bill of materials means that the coordination of the restart of the plant and winding down of the existing inventory, bringing up of new inventory requires that multiweek shutdown. And with that multiweek shutdown, we are making improvements to the line as well. I do want to make that very clear.
And the improvements are really focused on line rate and the ability to run the line at a higher speed and therefore, a more -- in a more efficient manner. And that increased line rate will ultimately translate to lower conversion costs, reduced hours per unit within the plant as we look at operating post shutdown through the rest of this year. Okay. And the EDV demand? Yes, this is something we've talked about in the past. We're really excited to have new customers running pilot programs. We have more of these pilot programs coming online. There's more and more images of our commercial vans being spotted with different logos on the side. But as we've said in the past, for these large fleets and the complexities associated with transitioning to an electric vehicle fleet, we expect these to start as pilots. And then over the course of this year, transition into larger scale orders. And we don't anticipate. And we've been careful to guide to say that -- really the significant step-up in demand associated with non-Amazon customers, we'll see that next year in the 2025 time frame. Our next question comes from George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. I'd like to just go back to one of the previous questions. Just to understand the Q1 delivery cadence of down -- that you said down 10% to 15% sequentially. Can you just kind of help us understand the reasons behind that? Is there anything to do with just the supply? Or was it informed by the comments you made around demand? Thanks, George. Claire referenced this in her opening remarks. During this quarter, a lot of the -- some of the supplier changeovers that we're working on, we're going to start to feel the impact of them. And we saw it in some of the onetime charges that we accumulated already in Q4. We're going to feel more of that in Q1. And along with that, we're going to be building several thousand vehicles that won't be deliverable to consumers. So we won't be factor-gating those vehicles in Q1. And so that's the reason you see the production guide lower in Q1 than what it was than what we achieved in Q4.
And so while the plant won't be shut down in Q1, we are going to start to feel the impacts of the scale of the supplier changeover that we're making. And that ultimately is going to translate into our deliveries as well. So with that said, we're going to be doing everything we can to, once the parts are available, to get those vehicles built and then make those deliveries as quickly as we can in the second quarter. Maybe as a follow-up just to understand. You have, I think, over 70,000 cars on the road to date, and I'm sure you've learned a lot from them being on the road, a lot of data collection. What has that data collection informed you about product performance and maybe what you're going to put into the R2? Yes, there's a lot. One of the things that's been most surprising to us is just watching how customers are interacting with the overall digital experience and digital ecosystem of the vehicle. And we track really closely how the experience of interacting in the vehicle translates into the mobile app and the use of the mobile app within the vehicle and -- or I should say, to access and work with the vehicle.
And so as we look at some of the features that are coming even in this year, it's to enhance the digital experience in the vehicle around dynamics, around usability, around activities that you can do in the vehicles, so some of the entertainment functions and continuing to make those interactions easier and more seamless. And the way we build our software road map, there's a strategic, let's call it, long form element that looks at how everything puzzles together in terms of partnerships, in terms of some of the capability that goes in.
But then there's also a very active dialogue with customers where we're not only active on forms, but we have user groups that send us feedback points and we address those. And I get a lot of joy out of our release notes that go out every 3, 4 weeks with every other update that we drop and then the feedback and the excitement that comes with that. With all that said, a lot of the learnings of what's gone into R1 beyond software around drivability, around how the vehicles are being used, around the importance placed on safety have played into really helping to shape how we're prioritizing cost of goods sold spending, if you will, on R2. And we're very excited to show the R2 product.
We think it really captures the most important sort of elements or the essence of Rivian as a brand and as a product, but in a smaller form factor package and, of course, at a lower price point. But it's still very much a Rivian, and we've had lots and lots of debates over the last 24 months around what the content needs to be in the vehicle to deliver on that Rivian-ness, if you will, while at the same time recognizing that certain trade-offs need to be made to achieve the lower price point. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. I wanted to start with a question on your bridge to gross margin breakeven. And I wanted to just contrast that versus the prior commentary you gave, which is that half of the improvement would come from volume, just cost absorption; a quarter from cost improvements; and the cost from -- a quarter from price. I recognize the starting points are different. But given a seemingly weaker volume environment, and I think maybe some questions on the pricing, what are the incremental offsets that you're seeing that still enable you to get to this gross margin breakeven? Is it just further improvements or breakthroughs on price than what you previously anticipated? And maybe if you could just comment for a second, if you reached variable margin breakeven in the fourth quarter on R1 just something that I believe you've previously targeted. Thanks, Dan. As you heard in my prepared remarks, the bridge -- the largest piece of the bridge lasts from Q4 '23 to Q4 2024, in which we expect to be modestly positive in gross profit is variable cost. And so that is enabled by as you heard RJ speak about the continued opportunity we have to renegotiate prices with suppliers.
We now have took care of R2, which is coming next, which has been an enabler for us to get to lower material costs across the board from a commercial context. We also have, which is largely unchanged, the planned engineering design changes that drive ample cost efficiency that will go into the product as part of the Q2 shutdown.
And then the areas where we've seen incremental opportunity is really what we've seen across the board from a commodities context where lithium prices have continued to soften across the board and have been more of a tailwind today in this bridge relative to the last bridge that we provided a year ago on our Q4 2022 earnings call as well.
As we look at the other elements, as you rightfully noted, right? The lever of fixed cost absorption is a smaller bucket for us today. As we think about the continuation of driving more operational efficiency as the lever, versus a massive step change in the underlying volumes associated with our 2024 guidance.
And then the last element on ASP, you've seen us take an incremental $12,000 of revenue per delivered vehicle Q4-over-Q4 from 2022 to 2023. And so we've already made very significant progress against a lot of the ASP side of the equation. And so what we indicated in our prepared remarks was really more directed on some of the non-vehicle-related services revenue opportunity. So that's continuation of sales of regulatory credits.
RJ spoke about the service opportunity just now as we build the car park. And more of what today is sitting in SG&A starts to become COGS or warranty expense, and that's another key enabler for us as well, as will the opportunity for Rivian to continue to offer additional software-related revenue streams in the future that will add to that broader ASP driver within the business as a whole.
On to your second question around the contribution margin of the vehicles. We were very close in achieving positive contribution for current priced vehicles in Q4 and see direct line of sight, as is evidenced by our continuation of committing to our Q4 positive gross profit as we look to the future and the impacts that the material cost reductions will have driven by our shutdown in Q2. Great. And then maybe if we could just have a follow-up on the demand side. And specifically, how do you think about elasticity of demand here? And I get it that most of the incremental volume you're looking at beyond the order book is coming from the go-to-market strategy. But beyond that, if that doesn't materialize as planned, how do you think about the pricing? Are you looking to hold firm on the price and maybe limit some of the volume upside? Or do you think that there would be potential for pricing actions? Yes, we're -- thanks, George (sic) [ Dan ]. We're constantly monitoring and looking at the pricing environment and understanding really what the overall macro environment is looking like and how to manage that. The -- to date, we've just recently launched our lowest price variant of R1 with the Standard pack. And as I indicated, we've seen very encouraging reaction to that. So there is demand elasticity as a function of price, for sure. But at this point, we feel comfortable with that pricing on the Standard pack and this -- but again, this is something in this environment, we have to go and eyes wide open and recognize how the rest of the market is reacting and how the rest of the market is behaving. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Yes. I think, first, I was hoping to better understand your drivers around the software and services part of the business. I think about 15% of the gross profit improvement by the fourth quarter of this year is coming from software and services. You've got a number of offerings there that you've spoken about, things like insurance, charging, regulatory credit sales, maybe you can rank order for us what you see some of the largest drivers are in terms of getting to that 15% coming from software services this year? Sure. The biggest driver there is driven by the increases that we saw in regulatory credits in aggregate. And so for us, we had $73 million for the entire year in sales of regulatory credits; and Q4 alone had $39 million. That was the largest driver. But beyond that, we continue to see growth across the maintenance and repairs from a service standpoint; our continued efforts in remarketing; and over the longer term, the opportunity to sell Rivian in the resale market as well, which we think is an important value driver for the business overall.
We've also been encouraged by the financing revenue streams as evidenced by both the ongoing straight financing of our vehicles, in addition to the introduction of leasing, which we launched in November of this year, which has been a key enabler for us to driving greater share of our financing penetration across all Rivian sold as well. And equally, as we think about the insurance business, that's an annuity type business as we've seen very strong renewal rates for existing customers that are now entering their second year, while we're also able to capture a significant portion of new customers as well. And so we're continuing to see strong tailwinds from each of the key drivers across the board and are excited to have a broader road map of more of these software-enabled services in the future. My second question was trying to understand how fixed the input cost environment might be for 2024 at this point. You spoke about some changes in things like lithium and battery pricing. I mean that can move around a little bit throughout the year. I mean have you already gotten firm commitments on some of these materials? And similarly, with suppliers, you oftentimes, either there's a volume requirement in order to get a certain price. You spoke around a partnership approach that some of the suppliers are taking and wanting to be involved with the R2 in terms of the longer-term opportunities with Rivian. But to the extent your volumes end up less than the 57,000 production target, is there some risk as well around what the input cost you'll be paying are? Yes, Mark, you referenced already, but I mean the raw material costs within the battery supply chain have changed dramatically in the last year, specifically lithium hydroxide is down by about 4x from north of $80 a kilogram to just over $20 a kilogram today. So that has a very significant impact on our overall cost structure.
But getting into just thinking about the overall supply chain sort of health for us and overall material costs, we're just seeing a dramatically different environment for sourcing than what we had previously. And when we think about when we source R1, and a lot of the billing materials that we've been operating off of and the contracts we've been operating off of to date, those are contracts that went in place in 2019, 2020, where Rivian was in a very different negotiating position with those suppliers and where the industry was in a very different position to be making commitments to us.
Fast forward to today, those same suppliers are highly engaged, very enthusiastic about the product. And they've experienced very much firsthand some of the challenges of supplying other products, and some of the products from large established OEMs have not done nearly as well as what they thought they would or what those other manufacturers thought they would. And on a relative basis, looking at those and comparing it to us, they now see us as a large customer, and they see what's coming with R2 and that gives us a really meaningful negotiating leverage.
And in many cases, we've been able to negotiate with our existing suppliers meaningful cost reductions that remove any of the price premium that we would have been paying before associated with us being a new company. But in cases where we haven't been able to do that, we've been very active on resourcing suppliers and bring on -- ending supplier relationships and bringing on new suppliers. And we have a relentless focus on driving our cost of goods sold down through those activities.
Now in cases where we're either changing the part design or changing out a supplier, it's not as if we can press a button, and it happens immediately. There's both the tooling time; there's the bring up of the supplier; and then, there's the coordination of the transition. And the shutdown, as I said, this will be the single largest consolidated set of supply chain changes that we've had by far since we started production.
And we had a similar set of changes we made on EDV early part of 2023 when we shut the line down, and out of that, we achieved a material cost reduction of 35%. But the scale of the changes we're making on R1 is meaningfully bigger in terms of number of suppliers and number of components with the shutdown that we're planning here in the second quarter of this year. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. I was hoping you can help me understand better how the introduction of the Standard packs helps with your targets and strategy. I think the previous plan, I think you may have shared with us, was perhaps to introduce it once you've actually had a chance to incorporate some of the cost savings and potentially lower battery packs and efficiencies, et cetera. But I guess by doing it now, the price point is probably like $9,000 below the Large pack, but the battery pack is not that much smaller, like 14-kilowatt or smaller. So it feels like it's a large price cost without much of a cost to bill of  material of it. And so I'm curious, does it help you with volume scale in terms of getting to that breakeven gross margin? Where does it fit in the equation? Yes. Emmanuel, as you said, Standard pack has long been part of the strategy to have the 3 different battery pack sizes. And ultimately, it helps us access the most price-sensitive customers. We pulled it into this quarter really with the intent of answering what we were seeing as a real customer request and a lot of our customers looking forward to that configuration. But we also are able to use this as a chance to really better understand the overall demand curve.
And when we look at the different configurations that we offer, up until recently, we really had our -- we had our Large pack with Quad motor and then our Max pack. So we were -- we've built out the high price side of our portfolio, but we hadn't brought in the more affordable variants of R1. And so what we're really encouraged by is not only the excitement around that for, as I said, our most price-sensitive customers, but the fact that it's driving awareness, which somewhat may be not immediately obvious.
But what it is driving is more demand for our Quad motor Large pack as well. So we've seen a step-up in new orders for the Quad Large, which is supported by folks that are becoming aware of the vehicle or becoming aware of the brand, getting drawn in by Standard pack, but then recognizing that they'd actually be willing to pay for the upgraded range or the upgraded performance that comes with either the Large pack or the quad Motor. Understood. And then as a follow-up then, staying on the topic of pricing. If I'm looking at your gross margin walk towards breakeven in the fourth quarter, obviously, the only piece about pricing there is sort of like this adjacent revenue and it's a positive one. I don't -- is there any risk of downside risk from pricing on existing vehicle?
I mean I'm thinking about specifically the introduction of the Standard pack. This is obviously cheaper than the vehicles you were selling before. And so to a certain extent, all else equal, that would put some pressure on pricing. So any reason why that would not be part of the walk? Emmanuel, as we think about the ASP lever throughout the course of the year, we'll see fluctuations that will mirror our production ramp. So we'll start, following our shutdown in Q2, with production of our Standard pack vehicles across the board. So while you see higher ASPs in Q4, driven by a higher concentration of Max packs that were available in that period, you'll see some fluctuations throughout the course of the year. But by the time we get to Q4 of next year, we'll have that full suite of offerings as a whole that allows us to drive more  equal levels of ASP on the R1 portfolio as a whole, which is embedded within that Q4 2024 bridge. And then as I spoke about, the increase from there is really driven by many of the nonvehicle revenue streams, which will be additive in aggregate as we're servicing a larger car park within the market. I would now like to turn the call back over to RJ for any closing remarks. Well, thanks, everyone, for spending the time with us today and the thoughtful questions and discussion we were able to have. We're incredibly excited about the strength of customer excitement for our brand and for what we're building as a company, and with that, looking forward to continue to make progress on our drive towards profitability as a business. And an important component of that is, of course, the unveiling and showing of our R2 product line, which will be showing on March 7. And that will embody a lot of the learnings that we've talked about in the context of launching and ramping R1, in a product that we think really fits the market and really fits the largest segment of demand that's available today.
So with that, thank you, everyone, for the time and look forward to our next call. Thank you for your participation.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions, reflect management's views as of today.
We will also be making statements related to our business operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments in the first quarter and provide an update on the expected progress we're making against our value drivers.
First quarter results exceeded our outlook and set a strong foundation for the remainder of the year as we focus on continued demand generation, delivering cost and plant efficiency improvements, advancing our 2 development and driving towards profitability. We continue to make strong progress across each of these goals.
Before discussing key developments during the quarter, I want to congratulate the team on producing our 100,000th vehicle at our plant in Normal and successfully navigating our plant retooling upgrade. While we focus on the work ahead, it's incredible to see what our team has accomplished across our consumer and commercial vehicle platforms.
I also want to highlight the uniqueness of what we're building at Rivian. We have developed a technology platform and brand that are truly differentiated. Our vertically integrated hardware and software capabilities enable continuous enhancements to the product. Our ability to improve and add features across autonomy, battery management, digital experience, body control, vehicle dynamics and telematics, help deliver an elevated ownership experience for both our consumer and commercial offerings.
We also recently transitioned to a new zone, network architecture, which reduced the number of electronic control units in our vehicle by approximately 60%, taking substantial costs out of our vehicles.
The feedback on our products have been incredible. Since the start of production, we have introduced approximately 30 over-the-year updates and through an owner satisfaction survey conducted by consumer reports, Rivian was recognized as the #1 automotive brand with the highest likelihood for customers to purchase again.
And launching the R1 platform, our goal is to create a brand that deeply resonates with customers. During the first quarter of 2024, Rivian was the fifth best-selling EV maker in the United States with a market share of 5.1%. Our vehicles have driven more than 900 million cumulative miles and our brand awareness and market position continues to grow. Additionally, the R1T is the only pickup in the United States to receive the Top Safety Pick+ award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Building on this, the results of our recently implemented demand generation and brand awareness strategies have been encouraging. We hosted over 28,000 demo drivers in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 90% versus the fourth quarter of 2023.
We recently launched R1S leasing and grew the number of states with this offering. While the broader vehicle market is still experiencing challenges, we are encouraged by the early results of our initiatives and have confidence in our 2024 delivery outlook.
In March, we unveiled our new midsized platform, which underpins the R2, R3 and R3X products. It's great to see the outstanding support for our brand and upcoming products. R2 is our versatile new midsized SUV with room for 5 people. It captures the essence of Rivian. It's built for ventures as well as everyday use with its exceptional utility, performance and capability. We expect the price to start at $45,000 with delivery started to begin in the first half of 2026.
R3 is our mid-size crossover. This unique vehicle has tidy end dimensions, but delivers big in terms of performance, passenger comfort and storage. R3X is a performance variant of R3, offering even more dynamic abilities, both on and off-road. R3 demonstrates the scalability of Rivian across different form factors and segments. It will be priced below our R2 and deliveries will start after R2 to ensure a smooth launch and rapid ramp.
With these new products, our goal is to take the desirability and brand strength we've established for our R1 products with the R1S remaining the best-selling EV over $70,000 in the United States and translate this strength to a much larger addressable market.
Our midsize platform leverages key technologies developed for R1, including our in-house software, in-vehicle electronics, propulsion and battery technology and our high-voltage platforms, with a goal to deliver dramatically simplified and lower-cost vehicles relative to R1.
Our massive focus on cost and efficient manufacturing for R2 and R3 is achieved by deeply analyzing every system and associated component and asking if it can be simplified or through opportunities for part consolidation or elimination. Use of large high-pressure die castings in the body structure, a structural battery pack, whereby the top of batteries, the floor of the vehicle, further simplification of the electrical system and associated wiring harness through a focus on electronic control unit design topology are just a few examples of how we're using innovation to drive down cost.
Beyond engineering opportunities when compared to R1, R2 also has significant cost opportunities through competitive sourcing. At the unveil of R2, we announced accelerating the start production in the first half of 2026 and reducing our capital needs for the launch of R2 by starting production of R2 in our Normal plant. This will provide flexibility to manufacture and estimate 215,000 total annual units per year, which includes up to 155,000 units of R2.
Starting R2 production in Normal is expected to save over $2.25 billion between now and the start production as compared to the original plan of launching the first line of our R2 production at Rivian's Georgia site. Incremental to the $2.25 billion in expected savings, we recently announced an incentive package from the state of Illinois with a value of up to $827 million. We're excited to grow our community in Normal and continue our partnership with the State of Illinois.
Turning to our recent tooling upgrades in our Normal facility. The team made meaningful progress, and we're now back to producing R1 vehicles on our production line. The upgrade introduced new technologies and cost-focused material changes into the R1 vehicle platform. The plant retooling upgrade also provided the opportunity to improve manufacturing processes that enable the R1 line to run at approximately 30% higher line rate. And additionally, we improved the flow materials and inventory within the plant. These changes are expected to improve cycle time, utilization and cost.
The opportunity ahead is significant. We hold the deep conviction that the entire automotive industry will electrify over the long term. And we continue to take the necessary steps to best position Rivian as a leader in this transition. We look forward to sharing more details around our strategy, progress and outlook in late June when we host our Investor Day.
I would like to thank all those who continue to support our vision, including employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders.
With that, I'll pass the call to Claire. Thanks, RJ. I want to start by reiterating the significant progress and strong results achieved during the first quarter. We exceeded our first quarter delivery outlook, successfully completed our plant retooling upgrade and are making progress on our path to profitability.
During the first quarter, we produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588 vehicles, which represented the primary driver of the $1.2 billion of revenue we generated. Our first quarter results did not include any meaningful regulatory credit sales. Based on discussions with potential customers and executed contracts, we expect the sale of regulatory credits to increase in the second half of the year.
Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $527 million. Our gross profit loss per vehicle delivered was approximately $39,000, which includes $15,500 of depreciation and $1,700 of stock-based compensation expense. Our results were negatively impacted by approximately $9,300 per vehicle delivered as part of our cost of revenue efficiency initiatives, which we don't anticipate to be part of our long-term cost structure.
We continue to move closer to making money on every vehicle we sell. We expect to see meaningful improvement in our gross profit during the second half of this year and believe we will reach a positive gross profit for the fourth quarter.
Our confidence is underpinned by the actions we have taken within our control. Specifically, we expect the recent completion of the tooling upgrade in Normal result in meaningful cost improvements in R1 and the manufacturing line. The upgrade includes the integration of R1 engineering design changes and newly negotiated supplier components that will drive significant cost reductions in our bill of materials.
Additionally, fixed costs will benefit from improved manufacturing efficiencies, reduction in our loss reserve as well as a reduction in our depreciation expense as we fully depreciate our original tooling for R1 and RCB.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $798 million, which was in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we experienced elevated cash usage in part due to increased accounts receivable and inventory balances. Consistent with our commentary on our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call, at the end of the first quarter, we had a few thousand vehicles, which were built but not yet counted towards our production since they were awaiting parts. These work-in-progress vehicles impacted our first quarter inventory. However, they are now complete and will be counted in the second quarter production.
Between this dynamic and our efforts to reduce our raw material inventory balances, we expect to generate a slight cash benefit from working capital for the year. Over the next 18 months, we plan to reduce our gross inventory balance by more than 25%, providing a significant working capital benefit.
I want to take a moment to emphasize the significant steps being taken to drive greater capital efficiency throughout the business. These actions include starting production of R2 in Normal, driving material costs down, increasing manufacturing and production efficiency, reducing operating and capital expenditures and optimizing working capital. These actions are expected to extend our existing cash balance to fund operations through the launch of R2 in the first half of 2026.
As RJ mentioned, our decision to launch our R2 in Normal provides the plant with more flexibility and is expected to reduce our cash usage by over $2.25 billion through its launch in the first half of 2026. We anticipate that most of the work to integrate R2 into our Normal facility will happen in 2025. And as a result, the plant will be down for a few weeks next year.
We recently completed the plant retooling upgrade in Normal. This is a pivotal step in driving greater efficiency in R1 through a reduction in variable and semi-fixed costs. We expect lower variable cost to be the largest driver of gross profit improvement in 2024. We are also beginning to see some of the benefits from R2 sourcing on R1 and EDV cost downs with strategic suppliers.
We are making progress driving greater fixed cost efficiencies by transitioning to 2 shifts from 3 shifts on the R1 line. This is made possible by a planned 30% increase in line rate. On a 2-shift operation, annual R1 capacity will be approximately 56,000 units. While we don't expect to fully realize these benefits until the second half of 2024, we believe these changes position Rivian to exit 2024 with a much improved margin profile.
In addition, since the beginning of the year, we've made meaningful progress optimizing operating expenses. We expect our adjusted operating expenses for the year to be down slightly as compared to 2023, with the second half operating expenses expected to be significantly below the first half. We believe this enables Rivian to start 2025 with a more efficient baseline cost structure. We are confident these changes best position Rivian to extend its cash runway, improve long-term profitability and gain market share.
We believe that operating normal at 215,000 units of annual production while executing against our cost efficiency road map, will allow the business to generate positive free cash flow, excluding growth capital investments and new production capacity.
Turning to our guidance. We are reiterating our 2024 production guidance of 57,000 vehicles. As RJ mentioned, we're encouraged by the early results of our go-to-market and brand awareness activities, which the team has put in place over the past quarter. And I have confidence that total deliveries for the year will grow by low single-digits for both R1 as well as our commercial vans as compared to 2023. We are also reiterating our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $2.7 billion.
We continue to look for ways to rationalize our capital expenditures and due to the decision to move the first line of R2 production to Normal, we are reducing our 2024 CapEx guidance by $550 million to $1.2 billion. We expect the savings from this decision will also impact 2025 CapEx, which we expect to be approximately $1.5 billion. Additionally, we plan to receive approximately $100 million in cash proceeds from the State of Illinois this year to help fund our Normal plant expansion. Over the long term, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
I want to, again, thank our team, partners, customers, suppliers and shareholders for their tremendous support.
With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Claire, you said you have confidence that there could be some growth in deliveries this year, and you talked about some traction that you've seen from some of the initiatives, including rolling out leasing to more states and also the new variants like Standard, Pack that have become available, want you could elaborate a bit more on some of those items and share what's giving you the confidence to guide for some modest delivery volume growth this year? Thanks, Mark. As we think about our broader confidence around demand, it's really driven by some of the early results that we've seen from our go-to-market initiatives, including the launch of leasing. Q1 was the first quarter that we introduced leasing for R1S, and we've now been able to expand the number of states that we offer leasing up to 32 and we'll be adding that to north of 40 over the coming quarters as well. As evidenced by some of the inclusion on the 20,000 test drives that we've had over the course of this quarter, getting more customers into the driver seat has certainly been a compelling tactic for us as well.
And then as you noted, the introduction of Standard, Pack and our ability to stretch the bottom end of the entry price point of the R1 product itself, was another key initiative that we launched over the course of Q1. And I think the last but certainly not least was the opportunity that we had to grow broad-based brand awareness through the launch of the R2 reveal and R3 and R3X as well that generated significant interest in Rivian as a whole. That's helpful. My next question was around the target to reach a positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year, which you reiterated today. Can you share a bit more on how the path is tracking in order to get to that level? And to the extent it changed at all in terms of some of the key inputs needed to reach that relative to what you put in your 4Q '23 Shareholder Letter? The largest driver for us in our path to positive gross profit remains the improvement in variable cost reduction. And within this category, it's predominantly driven by material cost reduction. In Q1, we saw material cost improvements for each of our vehicles, the R1T, the R1NS and EDV. And we expect to see a step change in our R1 material costs driven by the introduction of engineering-driven design changes as well as cost focused material changes that we've already negotiated with suppliers. We also expect to see commodity tailwinds in the second half of 2024 as well as the added benefit from R2 sourcing on our ongoing commercial cost downs.
Next, turning to our semi-fixed costs. There are 2 key drivers for the improvement: the tooling upgrades we made in the Normal plant enable us the ability to increase our line rate by roughly 30%, which reduces our per-unit labor and overhead costs. And we also expect to see depreciation expense decline by Q4 as we fully depreciate some of our original tooling and moved past the accelerated depreciation we incurred in Q1. The final lever, as we've talked about in the past, is an increase in our revenue per delivered unit due to the increased sales of regulatory credits, software and services revenue as well as remarketing sales.
So in summary, we have a detailed road map that we're executing against and continue to feel confident in our plan and our path to achieve positive gross profit in Q4 of this year. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. So RJ, I'm going to assume you're not going to comment on the widespread story today of a large maker of loans, potentially collaborating with an electric vehicle start-up, unless you want to. But what would be in it for a player of that ilk work with you or let me put it this way, what would be worthwhile to Rivian to benefit from a player like that, that Amazon doesn't already strategically and technically provide support to you already? And I have a follow-up. Thanks, Adam. Yes, we don't comment on market rumors or speculation. But as you alluded to, we have a history of partnership and of course, Amazon, who's our largest shareholder today and a very close partner across a variety of avenues, has been really a foundational element of the business. They were core to launching the commercial arm of the business and today represent the vast majority of our commercial vehicle sales.
But as we think about what we've built as a company, one of the core elements that makes this unique is just the level of vertical integration around our software and associated electronics platforms. So the ECUs in the vehicle and essentially the various computers across the vehicle and then the base software, the base operating system all the way up through the applications layer, creating those ourselves without the need to rely on Tier 1 suppliers gives us a lot of customer-facing strength, but also creates opportunities for partnership certainly. RJ, just then as a follow-up to that, if I focused on your vehicles, ADAS and data collection capabilities, Driver Plus, 10 exterior cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 5 radars. You got compute, you mentioned the vertical integrated, your custom ECUs and architecture. I think you -- your fleet drives more in 5 hours than Apple did in all of last year with their autonomous car program before it was canceled.
And we're hearing from people in that field of ADAS and robotics that there's been a real revolution due to LLM and GenAI on bringing forth end-to-end learning and neural net training. I'm curious if you have also witnessed that, you and your autonomy team can concur with that? And if so, does that then change your CapEx profile of how you allocate it to super compute, either directly through NVIDIA GPU clusters as part of your CapEx the way your rival Tesla is doing or otherwise working through partners and hyperscalers and Amazon in order to get access to that compute to get closer to achieving autonomy? You -- just in the nature of the question, you made a point that we've made for a while, which we really agree with, which is a key element to deliver really strong autonomy platform and something that continues to grow and get better over time is controlling the perception stack. And by controlling the perceptions to access the cameras and radars in particular, it allows us to have early fusion of that information. And the early fusion of that information allows us to not only best perceive the situation around the vehicle, but to create the best response that the best controls for what the vehicle should do next.
And the challenge with systems that are built through a collection of third-party sourced sensors or third-party source software is that, that learning loop and the opportunity to leverage the entirety of the sensor set and the perception stack becomes far more limited. And so we've architected our autonomous platforms and in particular, what's the com on our future platforms around really controlling the entirety of all of the data coming in and then also really control how we use a lot of training models to continue to drive progress into the platform.
Now as you point out, the training models, there's lots of ways to run them, but ultimately, it requires a build-out over time of a large -- very large clusters of CPUs to help train and build the robustness into our driving models. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Just a first question, R.J. Now that we've got the 2 of 3 unveiled and the 3X, we're kind of at a point where we're looking at 4 to 5 to probably maybe 6 vehicle portfolio. I'm just curious as we get through the ramp up 2 and then the 3, the 3X. How do you think you're going to manage this portfolio? Just going to be a portfolio of the churns over time and is reinvesting in? Or is it going to be something that's sort of continuous improvement in software-defined vehicles and there's not going to be refreshes over time? I'm just curious how you kind of see managing of what's becoming a pretty robust and complete portfolio at this point? Yes. Thanks, John. The R1 platform really represents the flagship product for us as a company and was our handshake with the world as in terms of introducing Rivian as a brand to customers. But importantly, because of its position as a flagship product, its price point is such that it doesn't allow us to access the largest part of the market. And so our midsize platform, which underpins the R2 and R3 products is really important for us as a company and the launch of that platform with R2 in the first half of 2026, represents a step change in the scale of the addressable market we can go after as a business.
And what we've demonstrated so far and what you'll continue to see from us, for our products, whether that be R1, R2 or R3 is a really heavy focus on using software to continue to make the vehicles better and better over time. And so as I noted in my opening remarks, we've had over 30 over the air updates on the R1 platform since we launched the vehicle. And this has led to a really vibrant customer community that there's a number of folks online following these releases that track every detail and it creates a moment of excitement for our owners when they see the vehicle get better every couple of weeks.
And so this is something we're absolutely going to maintain and is foundational and core to us as a business and we think, creates a very different type of ownership experience relative to what we've historically known is owning a car. And maybe if you could just follow up on that. I mean, there's folks that make [indiscernible] that basically back [indiscernible] change [indiscernible] and a look on a product cycle basis it's 1 to 2 years. I mean do you think that the vehicles can really stay somewhat [indiscernible] in a physical form and not yet [indiscernible] on a 4- to 5-year cycle.
I'm just -- I mean that's kind of where the question kind of get [indiscernible] product portfolio rationally turnover 5 to 6 years. You believe that is not very different, but we're also seeing strong black bricks that they realize that actually for [indiscernible]. It's early days for the [indiscernible] product portfolio, but I'm just curious about the philosophy there. I think this is a nuanced element here. But historically, when we thought about a product life cycle, a product would launch and it really wouldn't change much until the update came out, which would be, as you said, often 4, 5 years between product product launching and its update coming out. And what we believe is the product needs to get better over time. And I talked a moment ago about software, but there's also going to be hardware improvements that occur over time. That's compute, that's sensor set and also, of course, improvements in how we build the vehicles, so cost and efficiency improvements. It's already realizing that today.
We don't think of the vehicles as a static product, but rather something that continues to get better, continues to improve on cost structure. And really, the nature of what the vehicle looks like has a lot to do with just the approach of the company and the brand. And for us, we've really emphasized building a timeless design that's not something that's of the moment or something that feels old 6 months after it's released. And we think that timeless element of the design actually provides us the opportunity to make less significant exterior design changes while we continue to make progress with what's under the skin. Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the 827 from the [indiscernible], the $2.25 billion lower capital for the Normal plant versus the Georgia plant. It doesn't sound like you're changing that even though you're getting to 827 from Illinois just yet. But if you were to pro forma how much lower capital performing for that, what would you roughly think it would be? I mean it sounds like there's other things that capital is not going just directly to the plant, but it goes to other infrastructure, but how much do you think -- more -- do you think can lower that capital? John, I think the most direct comparison is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is the upfront cash that we'll receive from State of Illinois, which is roughly $100 million this year. Both Georgia's and Senate package as well as Illinois had payroll incentives, tax incentives associated with each of them. But in the near term, I would pinpoint that as being incremental to the $2.25 billion of savings that we communicated when we revealed R2. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Wanted to start with a question on COGS trajectory. And specifically, if you're doing -- if you're planning on doing, call it, a mid-$40,000 base price for R2, it means that to get any sort of a decent gross margin, you need to get probably COGS per unit in the high $30,000 range. You just did, call it, like mid-120s. So we're talking about almost $100,000, a little less of improvement in COGS unit.
So maybe you can just help us conceptually or directionally understand how we bridge from COGS per unit today down to where you need to be on R2. I understand it's partially decontenting, partially it's smaller form factor, there's scale. But maybe you could just walk through the pieces, how much is in your control, what's easier, what's a bit trickier? Any sort of framework would be helpful. Thanks, Dan. First, I just want to reiterate what Claire said before, which is, on the R1 product, we are on a life cycle to materially improve its cost of goods sold. And so we're going to see that play out over the course of the year. The reason for the shutdown that we just went through was to implement not only changes in the plant to improve process flow and increase the production rate by 30%, but also to integrate a very large number of changes into the vehicle that are focused on costs.
So those are new suppliers, with updated part designs or designs that have been optimized around cost, areas of vehicle where we've actually consolidated parts or eliminated parts. And without going through all the examples, even on this changeover, there are areas of the body structure, for example, where the cost reduction was well in excess of 50%. And that's through part consolidation or part elimination or redesigning a part using different materials or different processes.
So as we wind that forward into R2, R2 is a fundamentally different architecture. It's built to a different set of requirements. R1 has a very extreme set of requirements in terms of on and off-road capability, whereas the R2 product will still be very capable of on and off road, but not to the true extreme that the flagship product has. And every decision we take, that's every part, every system, every component, it goes through the lens of, is the part needed, can the part be consolidated, can the function of that partner system be performed by another partner system? And it's leading to a materially different vehicle architecture from a body structure point of view and vehicle integration point of view. But it's also supplemented by very different supplier relationship, there are set of supply relationships then what we have when we negotiated cost on R1 years ago.
And so we remain very bullish on our ability to deliver on the R2 cost structure. It of course, requires us to execute as we pull the full program together and complete the sourcing on the vehicle. But it is a significant set of improvements. And I called out a few of the examples, but just to reiterate those, part consolidation, it can come in many forms. Use of high-pressure die casting is one way to achieve it. Another is to have parts to do more than one thing. So the use of the top of the battery pack is the floor of the vehicle as an example.
We have massively simplified closure systems in the doors for R2 versus R1. And then not often appreciated, but really significant is just the opportunity from an electrical point of view in the vehicle to minimize the number of ECUs and optimize the location of those ECUs as well as whatever they're actuating or sensing to minimize the harness design.
And so across the board, holistically, we're making all those types of changes, leveraging the learnings from R1T, R1S, the EDV and the most recent shutdown, which is leading to the significant cost reductions in R1 as we roll those into the R2 program to make sure we can achieve, as you said, aggressive but necessary COGS targets. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on vertical integration. And so I understand that the move to put R2 into Normal instead of Georgia was one of capital efficiency. But just amid this pivot, and strategy, maybe you can give us a sense that if you're thinking any differently about your level of vertical integration. I understand vertical integration is obviously still very key to the strategy, but are you thinking any differently about the level of vertical integration that you're pursuing maybe relying on partners a bit more versus what you maybe would have done in-house in the past? Sure. I just referenced it a bit, Dan, but one of the really key areas for us is controlling the electrical architecture in the vehicle, the network architecture and then the associated software that's running across all those platforms. And what that -- versus what the vast, vast majority of vehicle manufacturers pursue essentially the exception of one other manufacturer, which is a Tier 1 heavy approach for Tier 1 suppliers provide a variety of controllers that control of function within the vehicle.
By controlling all those computers, all those ECUs, it allows us to much more easily consolidate functions, not by the domain, but rather across zones. So we can set up, what we call a zoner controller, that's in an area of the vehicle that controls all functions across that area. And the amount of savings that's possible by doing this is not measured in hundreds of dollars, but measured in thousands of dollars and the simplification of the vehicle harness that results from that is also quite significant.
And that's all Rivian facing advantages in terms of cost, simplification, simplifies the build process. But it also creates a lot of advantages for customers. We've already seen this from the launch of R1 where the control of those -- all those platforms allow us to do deep over the year updates. When I say deep, I mean real over the air updates. We're not just changing a color on the screen, but rather introducing real features, changing the way the vehicle drives, improving the battery performance, improving thermal performance, things that are meaningful to the ownership experience of the vehicle.
And that we remain very convicted on and, in fact, the benefits of the heavy investment necessary to build up all that capability, what will really be realized with R2, where R2 will leverage the network architecture, the ECU topology, of course, the software stack that's been developed in R1 and the changes that we've just made as part of the cost-down process with R1, that architecture will be going into R2. So we can look at this also as a derisking of the launch of R2.
And while I've talked about software and electronics, it's important to note that this also extends to the way we've approached a high-voltage systems. So our batteries or battery packs, battery modules, drive units, inverters, these are all areas that we've developed in-house technology around. And of course, at the scale of R1, it has a high fixed cost associated with it. But with R2 coming online, we really see significant structural cost advantages by owning these areas and by building these areas in-house. Our next question comes from George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're bringing the lines back up. Curious as to what you can share in terms of the experience there? And also how the new supply relationships have gone? I know you've decided to switch out some suppliers and any detail there would be appreciated. George, it was interesting. We -- at the start of the month, at the start of April, we stopped production of our launch vehicle and walking through the plant and seeing it without a single vehicle on a line was a unique feeling. We hadn't seen that since we started production and sort of gave you a bit of a feeling in your stomach as you walk through. And the precision in the execution of integrating so much new equipment, new process design, as you saw in the letter, hundreds of new robots and hundreds of updated or modified robots into the plant, to allow the plant to run at a 30% higher line rate.
And to have the orchestra of all those activities, both in the plant and then across our supply base, to have a very large number of new suppliers come on board and a significant portion of the build of materials change over to these new suppliers and updated part designs, to have executed that full effort with the intensity and the focus to drive that efficiency into the plant and into our overall COGS structure.
It was really -- it was an exciting April to say the least. And it's amazing to see the plant running again to see the changes we put in place, solving some of the challenges that existed in the line before, solving some of the areas where we felt the costs were not appropriate at the vehicle level. And we're excited to see those changes manifest in the improvements in our cost of goods sold and of course, in the road map to our positive gross margin. Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I know you mentioned that R2 is coming in the first half of '26. So what are the opportunities to potentially pull that forward in terms of timing? The decision to launch R2 out of Normal was to -- there's many things that drove it. Claire talked before about the $2.25 billion and capital savings associated with it. But beyond that, and what's harder to measure in the numbers was just the ability to leverage the existing teams and the operations that we have in Normal. And those teams -- it's taken us a lot of time, but we've built strong teams, strong leadership at the shop level. And I spend a lot of time at the plant, a lot of time on the floor with the -- with our team members. And that buildup of training capabilities, learning capabilities, leadership at the team leader group leader, manager and director level across the plant, is something we'll now be able to leverage, and it takes not only risk out of the R2 timing, but allowed us to pull R2 into the first half of 2026.
Now there's not a single person within Rivian that isn't trying to find ways to pull R2 forward, but we would love to see R2 sooner. The amount of excitement for the product is palpable, notwithstanding the excitement that we all have for it on our own. But we also want to ensure that the product when it hits the market is exceptional and making sure our supply base is robust, making sure there aren't supply issues as we launch is really important to ensure we have as smooth of a launch as possible, of course, learning from the R1T launch, the R1S launch, the EDV launch, the relaunch of EDV with post cost downs and now the relaunch of R1 post cost downs. We've gone through a number of launch events with each one getting better and stronger.
And the clarity we have on the importance of robustness of the supply chain, both from a quality point of view, but also from a ramp efficacy point of view, is driving us to make sure that as we think about that 2026 launch, it's not just what we can control in our plant, but it's through all the many relationships across our supply base to ensure we are ready step from not producing R2 at scale to producing at scale very quickly. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Perfect. So I'm wondering if you could talk about what the next, call it, 3 to 6 months, in Normal will look like now that you've gone through a lot of the heavy lifting with the retooling? To what extent is there any remaining execution or ramp risk with the plant as it exists right now? Thanks, Alex. Coming out of a launch, and I was just on line with the team going through how things are running post relaunch. The energy within the plant is palpable, the excitement to deliver on improved quality and improved cycle time is real. And with the changes we made around the overall efficiency to lay out, the efficiency and material flow, we're really excited to see that pull forward into reduction in cost of goods sold.
Now with that, it's not as if the plant turns back on immediately at full rate, so there is a ramp associated with it. We're following a prescribed and planned ramp of the facility. And that, as I said in my previous discussion, that ties to the suppliers. So we also need to make sure our suppliers are ramping at the same rate. And given the number of changes we've made with our supply base, those suppliers, in many cases, new suppliers are ramping along with us.
And so that -- as that's all happening, we're also really remain focused on ensuring that the plant in Normal is also getting ready to ingest R2. And so there's a number of investments we're making into Normal to ensure the R2 ramp is seamless and as capital efficient as possible as well. Okay. Perfect. And then I wanted to go back to something Claire mentioned regarding OpEx. It looks like second half OpEx spending is going to be down relative to the first half. Just wondering what it is that you're spending on now or what you did spend on in the first half that you won't be spending on in the second half. Is this marketing and outreach. You mentioned a lot with test drives and things of that nature after the R2 and R3 unveiling. Just -- or maybe it's R&D, just any additional clarity on that would be helpful. Sure. So the first point is, in the first half of the year in the buildup to the tooling upgrades that we made in Normal, there were higher levels of R&D spend associated with that. We'll see that increase as well Q1 into Q2 based off of the shutdown time that we took throughout the course of April and the incremental contractors and support that we had to bring back the lines up in short order and succession.
And so as we look to the second half of the year, as RJ mentioned, the pivot and focus from an R&D perspective starts to focus around more of the R2 development work versus the focus on both R2 as well as R1 and our commercial vans that you're seeing in the first half results and figures. And then beyond that, we're constantly driving incremental efficiency across the organization as a whole. And so that until finding ways in which we can reduce expense in other areas of SG&A to make room for the investments that we're making in our go-to-market teams between sales and service as a whole. And so that intensity and focus is what's enabling our path to reduce our operating expenses overall for the year, but also importantly, seeing that second half 2024 step change reduction in OpEx. And our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. My first question is now that the shutdown is completed and the upgrades completed. Could you help us quantify some of the benefit that you're expecting that are in your control. So they was hoping to understand it better. So you had a $39,000 loss per vehicle in Q1, $9,000 of that may be sort of like not a run rate. So call it maybe a $30,000 loss per vehicle starting point. How much is realistic for your cost of goods sold or bill of material to improve as a result of the actions that you just completed? How much per vehicle could we see in terms of reduction on the fixed cost? And how much do we have to assume? Or do you have to assume in terms of pricing or sort of like extra revenues essentially to get towards that positive gross profit per vehicle? Emmanuel, as you look back at our Q4 earnings call, we provided a detailed bridge and we continue to see line of sight into -- at the execution road map to achieve those results in aggregate. As I mentioned in one of my responses, the largest variable that we have ahead of ourselves is the reduction in our material costs. And similar to what we saw when we took downtime in Q1 of '23 to introduce our new Enduro Drive Unit as well as our LFP pack in the EDV itself, where we saw a 35% reduction in material costs.
There's significant cost savings coming through the introduction of engineering design-driven changes into the R1 as well as some of the material changes that we're making to conserve costs as well. So I have clear visibility into those reductions on a go-forward basis. And similarly, as I mentioned, the improvements in operational efficiency that we'll see with reductions in labor and overhead cost per unit given the increase of 30% in our line rate is also going to help enable the semi-fixed cost improvements that we anticipate throughout the course of this year as well.
And then there's dynamics with our depreciation and the fact that this quarter, we had accelerated depreciation going into our retooling upgrade in the plant itself, that will start to lap and will come off as we also begin to fully depreciate some of our original tooling that we'll see a material decrease in that depreciation expense per unit as well.
Beyond that, we'll see some additional LCNRB benefits in the back half of the year as we drive towards making money on every single vehicle that we sell. And then in terms of the underlying assumptions for both volume as well as price points, as we mentioned on our last earnings call, our anticipation is not a significant increase in overall volumes associated with Q4 '24 relative to Q4 of 2023 and equally a similar price point from an ASP perspective.
So that the revenue per unit driver is really driven by non-vehicle revenue streams, predominantly the sale of regulatory credits, we've seen a really robust appetite for our regulatory credits in the market, especially with many OEMs stepping back away from some of their electrification plans and then equally the ongoing sales of software and services revenues as well as our marketing revenue streams that will enable Rivian to achieve positive gross profit in the fourth quarter. Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the volume side. I think you made a comment in the prepared remarks that now that the shutdown is completed. You have 56,000 units of annual capacity for R1 on 2 shifts. Is this sort of let the right value to think about now on a go-forward basis for Rivian, all the way until R2 launches in the first half of 2026? So essentially, a maximum of 56,000 units of R1 minus any shutdown impact that you may have, let's say, next year, plus some level of growth in EVDs. But is that 56,000 essentially be the max you'll see in terms of annual R1 capacity? And then it's R2 that comes on top of it? Sure. So there's a couple of points I want to make. First, as we think about the longer-term introduction of R2 in Normal, we're building capacity towards 215,000 units in aggregate. And that can shift between R3 vehicle lines where we'll have 85,000 units of maximum capacity for R1, 65,000 units of capacity for commercial vans and 155,000 units of capacity for R2. So within that matrix, we'll have the ability to flex volumes to stay within the balance of the 215,000 units of total maximum capacity.
And so that could be achieved, for example, running 2 shifts on R1, full 3 shifts on R2 and a single shift on commercial vans. So there's flexibility as we think about the longer-term volumes but it is accurate. As you noted, that the R1 volumes will be 56,000 units based off of the 2-shift operation. And our next question comes from Shreyas Patil with Wolfe Research. RJ, I'm just curious how we should think about the speed at which you could ramp up R2 as we move into '26. I know it's still early, but with a lot of the innovations that you've already talked about around giga castings and structural battery packs, the simplified ECU architecture. Just how should we think about the pace at which you could get to volume production once R2 gets going? Shreyas, there's just 3 elements I'd call out. The first is, just our experience in learning and growth as a company in terms of managing and running a launch. And if I wind the clock back when we first launched R1T relative to where we are today, the strength of our operations organization, the strength of our launch teams and then the strength of our entire development process as that blends into the launch process is so much higher given the number of products we've launched and the number of iterations we've gone through there.
So with that said, key enablers for a smooth launch are, first and foremost, making sure the supply base can support the launch. And so we've built a robust supply base -- supply chain team that not only is responsible procuring those supplier relationships and putting in place those contracts, but importantly, also ensuring the development of those components and the launch of those components are at the quality levels that will support the rapid ramp-up of our plan. And of course, it's in the interest of the suppliers also have a rapid ramp up. Everybody wants to ramp as quickly as possible.
So the health of not only our process, but the health of the way we're managing the supply base for R2. And I should say that should be evidenced by what we will see and what we'll demonstrate here with the re-ramp post this launch. We've also seen it with the ramp of our in-house drive units. We've seen it with the re-ramp of our EDV program.
But the last item I'd call out is, just the nature of the product has been designed from the eco to also ramp for easily. So really heavy focus on an efficient design and a design that allows us to very easily put the vehicle together and takes away any of the risk items that we've either encountered on R1 or have addressed on R1 over the last 2 years. And maybe just a point of clarification for Claire. When you talk about reaching gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year, first, is that a run rate figure for Q4? And then secondly, does that exclude the various cost of revenue efficiency initiatives that you talked about. It looks like that's been excluded from the EBITDA calculation. I just wanted to make sure if that's also excluded from the gross profit target. Sure, Shreyas. As we look to Q4, we don't expect there to be some of those similar charges as we had in Q1 of this year that were really predominantly related to the Peregrine shutdown and some of the changes in supplier contracts that we mentioned itself. So we do expect Q4 to be gross profit positive for the quarter, and that sets us up nicely as we think about achieving positive gross profit for the full year of 2025 on a go-forward basis as well. And our last question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Claire, to go back to the capacity commentary because I know you said after launch, had plant changes. My understanding was that, that 215 requires an addition -- an additional paint shop. Is that still accurate? And like what's sort of the timing for that? Because I -- like is that going to be in advance of the R2 launch? Or are you going to sort of wait to see how the R2 launch is going before you start adding some of that capacity? Sure. Joe, as we look at the paint shop capacity in the plant, we're evaluating a number of different strategies to achieve the 215,000 units of total capacity. And so that could be within our existing paint shop that could be adding additional capacity beyond that. So it's something we're actively looking at at studying. [indiscernible] rate in the paint shop or the current capacity of paint shop then, it's below that 215. The current capacity is 150,000 units in the paint shop. And then R.J., just on the demand generation activities, like the 28,000 demo ride, a 91% increase like that feels significant. You mentioned that's an effective demand generation strategy. Obviously, getting potential customers and the vehicle is great. Is there anything you could tell us though, about conversion? Or like how should we like measure that? Like what context should we take a 28,000 demos because last quarter, you mentioned right? The guide is dependent on improvement in the order book, and it seems like this is what would help drive that. So I think it's important to understand how -- like either conversion or what sort of context we should take that number? Yes, Joe, as I said in my opening remarks, demo drives is a really critical focus for us in terms of expanding awareness of the brand, top of funnel demand and then translating that top of funnel demand all the way down through purchase. And so that 28,000 test drives or demo drives that we gave in Q1, that's roughly a 90% increase over what we did in Q4 of 2023. So it's a significant step-up and it was -- the result of us also leveraging our service network to administer a lot of those test drives, and we're really encouraged by the results. of that program, but it's one of many initiatives we have.
And I do want to just make sure I call out, we've also continued to expand our leasing program, which now includes R1S. We launched the R2 and the R3, which had an outstanding effect of just creating awareness around the brand, and we're encouraged by the early results that we're seeing. So you're satisfied with that improvement in the order book to hit the guidance for the year? Yes, we're -- as I said, we're encouraged with what we've done so far. And of course, it -- satisfies a funny word. I'd say my job is to never be satisfied, but I'd say we're very encouraged. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe for closing remarks. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We've talked, Claire and I, for the last few quarters about the shutdown that we've just completed and are now reramping R1 production following that. This is a really important step for us. It was a critical step in order to achieve the long-term gross margin potential of the R1 platform. And of course, therefore, the normal site. The execution that went into that from our teams and the precision through which that was pulled off, we're proud of, and we look forward to starting to see the numbers from that body of work flow into the financials and be able to talk about it in the context of these calls.
But with that, we're also happy to now have a physical and visual representation of our future products when we talk about R2. So it's not just an esoteric idea of a future product, but actually, you can see very specifically how we see Rivian expanding to more addressable markets and lower price point vehicles. And the team is incredibly focused on driving efficiency and driving cost effectiveness into the business across every aspect of what we do, what we'll see the most of is the improvements we're making in COGS, and that's build of materials, that's conversion costs. As Claire talked about, that also ties to even starting to realize some of the benefits of our accelerated depreciation of equipment, but we'll see that heavy focus continue. It's a cultural drive within the entire business.
And we are excited about going through the rest of this year and the path to demonstrating that through the gross margin profitability of R1. And then, of course, as that translates to R2 launching in early 2026.
So thank you, everybody, for joining and look forward to our next call. Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Rivian Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President, Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management's views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business, operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter.
During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. During the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call.
With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks. Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments in the quarter and provide an update on the progress we're making against our value drivers. Prior to discussing quarterly details, I want to reinforce the key messages conveyed in depth during our recent Investor Day. To achieve the full potential of our vision, we need to aggressively drive towards profitability. The fundamental levers underpinning this goal include the recent transition to our second generation R1 and the subsequent introduction of our midsize platform, which underpins our too. I'm encouraged by the progress ramping up a second generation R1 vehicles as well as developing R2, which we expect to launch in the first half of 2026.
The ability to dramatically reduce costs in a condensed time frame and drive continual improvement in the customer experience is based on our intentional approach to vertical integration. From the beginning, we have vertically integrated certain components of the vehicle, driven by the desire to create superior customer experiences and deliver long-term structural cost advantages. The success of this is demonstrated by a recent J.D. Power appeal study, where Rivian received the highest score and the most satisfying brand across the automotive industry. We spent years developing key technologies such as our software, electrical hardware, autonomy and propulsion. The significant cost of performance benefits from these technologies gives us confidence in our ability to continue developing and building highly desirable vehicles across the R1, R2 and R3 product lines.
As a testament to our industry-leading technology platform, on June 25, we announced the expected joint venture with Volkswagen Group. The announcement validates our technology platform and is expected to substantially expand the market applications for our software and associated Zonal electrical architecture. Rivian's electronics and software platform is expected to serve as the foundation for future software development in the partnership. The technical work stream to prepare the integration of our electric architecture and software technology stack into Volkswagen Group products is moving along very well, and we expect to close the joint venture in the fourth quarter of this year.
As the auto industry transitions to smarter, more connected, more complex, integrated vehicle architectures, we strongly believe our technology is best positioned to deliver a modular and scalable platform to help create highly compelling products and services that we expect will accelerate consumer shift to electrification.
I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our team. who has continued to execute on our second-generation R1 ramp of production and deliveries, R2 development and the formation of our joint venture with Volkswagen Group.
During the second quarter of 2024, we successfully completed the retooling upgrade in normal. This is a pivotal operational event for the company. The upper new technologies and cost-focused material changes into the R1 vehicle platform while also incorporating manufacturing process improvements that are expected to improve cycle time utilization and cost. For example, we have reduced complexity and lowered the cost associated with the vehicle body with a heavy emphasis on removing parts, processes and steps. These chains have reduced nearly 1,500 joints and contributed to an expected 30% improvement in the R1 production line rate.
Following completion of the retooling upgrade, we resumed production and are encouraged with the early press of ramping our second-generation R1 variants. The new R1 vehicles have hundreds of design, engineering and performance upgrades with the most significant being an entirely new zonal architecture, new compute and autonomy platform, new in-house drive units and a reengineered suspension system. The introduction of the second-generation R1 platform, combined with commercial cost downs and commodity tailwinds are expected to enable significant material cost reduction.
Importantly, I want to emphasize there is more to go. We are focused on reducing R1 costs beyond 2024 through lower material costs and conversion costs. As we continue to source materials for R2, we are seeing opportunities to further reduce the cost of R1 through additional supplier cost reductions. In addition, we believe the expected joint venture with Volkswagen Group will allow us to achieve more favorable pricing from suppliers. This food components, chipsets, printed circuit board assemblies and all the associated content that relates to those hardware systems.
I want to delve in further new second-generation drive units, which represent a significant change in capability and cost. The second generation R1 includes our Ascent motor system, which underpins our new tri-motor and Quad motor. These motor configurations, in addition to our dual motor released in 2023, mean all motors on all review vehicles are now designed, engineered and manufactured fully in-house. The 850-horsepower tri-motor variants are expected to start deliveries towards the end of the third quarter. The tri-motor variant is with 2 Ascent motors in the rear and one indura motor in the front for a blend of exceptional power and range. The tri-motor R1T delivers 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.9 seconds, while offering an estimated range in conserve mode of approximately 400 miles.
The quad-motor is designed for peak adventure with 4 Ascent motors. The quad-motor delivers 1,025 horsepower 0 to 60 in less than 2.5 secs and achieved 25-mile in less than 10.5 seconds. Feedback on our second-generation R1 has been very positive. It is a small better vehicle while simultaneously costing less to build. We're excited to get more of our sand generation products to customers and available for demo drives in the coming quarters.
We wake up every day thinking about ways to make our products better. This is based on our sense of urgency in transitioning the world towards a fossil fuel-free future. This is possible by creating products that are deeply exciting to consumers, products that carry attributes and design characteristics that pull people internal combustion vehicles because they're experiencing something that isn't just better for the environment, but also really enjoyable and desirable to use every day. I would like to thank all those who continue to support our vision, including employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders.
With that, I'll pass the call to Claire. Thanks, RJ. During the second quarter of 2024, we made significant progress driving greater cost efficiency further strengthening our balance sheet, validating the differentiated nature of our technology stack and establishing new business opportunities. During the second quarter, we produced 612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 vehicles, which represented the primary driver of the $1.2 billion of revenue we generated.
As expected, second quarter production was impacted by planned downtime associated with the retooling upgrade. Our deliveries were strong as we sold through the majority of inventory of our first-generation R1. Due to strong Q2 performance, which led to our lower starting finished goods inventory balance and the continued ramp of production throughout the third quarter, we expect our third quarter deliveries to be below our second quarter results and production volumes to be in line with our first quarter levels.
Total gross profit was negative $451 million. Our gross profit loss per vehicle delivered was approximately $33,000, which includes approximately $15,000 of depreciation and amortization expense and $1,200 of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we incurred approximately $2,400 per vehicle delivered in the quarter related to our cost of revenue efficiency initiatives, which we do not anticipate being part of our long-term normalized cost structure.
We expect to see significant cost reductions in our R1 platform during the second half of 2024 as we ramp the production and deliveries of our second-generation R1 vehicles. Additionally, the reduction in our LCNRV write-down for the quarter compared to Q1 2024 reflects the progress we are making in association with our material cost reduction and operational efficiencies associated with our second-generation R1 vehicles.
We remain confident in our path to modest positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full year of 2025. Importantly, our team is already focused on driving incremental costs out of our R1 platform to help achieve term gross profit target of 25%. The key drivers of our long-term R1 profitability include reducing material costs, leveraging our fixed costs and scaling our revenues per delivered unit through product mix and pricing, software and services and other revenues.
During the second quarter, we also announced the intention to form equally controlled and owned joint venture with the Volkswagen Group to create next-generation electrical architect and best-in-class software technology. In associating with this deal, Volkswagen Group have made an initial investment of $1 billion with up to $4 billion in planned additional investments for a total deal size of $5 billion. The incremental investments are subject to the completion of definitive agreements, the achievement of certain milestones and the receipt of regulatory approvals. Assuming all criteria are met, we expect that the full $5 billion is intended to flow to the benefit of Rivian.
In addition to the $5 billion of capital to Rivian, we anticipate incremental benefits through cost savings on materials, operating expense efficiencies and future revenue opportunities associated with the joint venture. The initial and planned investments by Volkswagen Group, in addition to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are expected to provide the capital to operations through the ramp of R2 and normal as well as the midsize platform in Georgia, enabling a path to positive free cash flow and meaningful scale. As RJ mentioned, we expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year, and we will provide additional details at that time.
During the second quarter, we improved our cash flow from operations to 41% as compared to the first quarter of 2024. This improvement is reflective of our continued focus on cost and greater working capital efficiency across the business. As compared to the first quarter of 2024, we reduced our gross profit loss per vehicle by approximately $6,000 and made reducing our gross inventory balance. We believe these trends will result in further improvements in our cash usage for the second half of 2024.
As we look ahead, we are reaffirming our 2024 production guidance of 57,000 units, delivery expectations of low single-digit growth as compared to 2023, EBITDA guidance of negative $2.7 billion and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion.
As a reminder, coming out of the retooling upgrade, we are currently operating the R1 line on operation, which results in 56,000 units of annual run rate output. Our commercial van line is currently running on a lid 1-shift operation, which has the potential to deliver a run rail output of 15,000 units.
As we look ahead for 2025, we expect that our normal facility will not be producing vehicles for more than 1 month during the second half of the year as we upgrade and integrate new equipment into the plant ahead of our first half of 2026 or 2 launch. We continue to see a clear path to a long-term approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.
I wanted to again thank our team, partners, customers, suppliers and shareholders for their tremendous support.
With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Maybe just to start, can you just please talk about your geographic strategy, particularly in Europe in light of the recent BBE relationship? Thanks, George. As it stands today, the R1 products are being sold throughout the United States and Canada. And our EDD products are primarily -- commercial end products are primarily focused in the United States, but we have made some deliveries in Europe and specifically in Germany.
Now with regards to our future products with R2 and of course, R3, those have been developed really at their core to fit not only the U.S. market but to also fit the European market. And you can really see it as you look at the R2-R3 combination of what we believe capturing a sweet spot in terms of both addressing them for midsize SUVs in both U.S. and European markets, but also with our 3 capturing a smaller crossover market. And so -- as you've heard us talk about many times, this is one of the things we're so excited about with the 2 platform is just the growth in the addressable market for us of the business. And maybe as a follow-up on the VW relationship. I know you're still working through the details you mentioned that. But is there any update on the potential to transfer some of your OpEx into that JV? Yes. As you said, we're -- we haven't announced the specifics around the joint venture, inclusive of any associated cost sharing. But I think importantly, I'd want to call out is how this relationship was formed, and it's really formed on the basis of leveraging the technical platform that we built around our network architecture or topology VC use, and of course, our software stack and allowing and enabling that technology to really well beyond Rivian's product line. And to allow enable us to get to global scale across multiple markets very quickly. So we're ecstatic about the impact that, that can drive in terms of helping to create exciting products that give consumers choices to move towards electrification. We're also excited about the scale that, that provides us from a sourcing point of view and a supply chain point of view as we think about the covenants and the assemblies that go into those systems. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. First, I was hoping to better understand how the company is tracking towards the target of positive gross margin in the fourth quarter? Has the drivers at all, especially as we've seen things like a 2.99% incentive that you're utilizing and perhaps that changes the mechanics to the positive gross profit bridge? Thanks, Mark. There are still 3 key drivers to our path to positive gross profit in Q4. The first is the variable cost improvement. Spent a lot of time at our Investor Day talking about the material cost reduction road map associated with our new Gen 2 technology introductions, material cost reductions that we've had through supplier negotiations as well as the commodity cost tailwinds that we anticipate seeing throughout the course of the second half of this year and into 2025 as well. The second driver is our fixed cost leverage, and this is enabled by the retooling upgrade that we had in normal, which has improved our production line rate by approximately 30%. And this, together with the increased Q4 production volumes, we anticipate seeing as well as our reduction in depreciation expense across the business will help drive this fixed cost leverage. And the last key driver for us, as we talked about in the past, is an increase in revenue per delivered unit. And this we'll see through the introduction of our Tri-Motor R1s that you heard RJ speak about in his prepared remarks, as well as non-vehicle revenue growth from the sale of regulatory credits and the introduction of our preowned com sales. We continue to remain confident in our path to positive gross profit in Q4, it's important to note that our Q2 results had very limited sales of our Gen 2 vehicles. So you're not actually seeing any of the flow-through of the improvements that we've made throughout our production line or our material costs yet flow through the results themselves as we look at the Q2 actions as a whole. My second question was how to better think about the material cost improvement? You're looking to achieve, such as the 20% for the dual motor large pack, second Gen 1 compared to the first Gen. I think those cost improvements did not incorporate some of the potential savings you think you may be able to realize now that you have the VW news out there and some of the response you've seen from suppliers. So I realize it's still somewhat early, but can you share a bit on the magnitude of potential material cost improvements you may see as you're able to execute on some of that expanded opportunity? Yes. Thanks, Mark, for the follow-up. You're absolutely right. There's -- the 20% that we've referenced in cost reduction on the bill materials for a like-for-like vehicle that's based upon technical changes we made to the vehicle and supplier negotiations that we drove over the last 18 months. There's certainly more room to go in terms of applying some of the leverage that we're going to see, not only with the relationship we're building with Volkswagen, but also with the scale that comes with R2. And so we do see continued progress as we drive towards the long-term goal of 25% gross margin for our normal facility. And it's -- these continued cost efforts that we're talking about here on reducing our building materials, we also see improvements happen in our conversion costs at the plant. And those conversion costs are both the continued progress on efficiency improvements within the plant, but also over time, the enhanced fixed cost leverage that's going to come from bringing R2 to production -- to be produced in normal as well. Our next question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jeffries. A couple of questions for me. One is Velo mentioned on EV in the release. Could you give us an update on how your customer trials are going on and might have kind of an idea of when you might have first customers outside of the deal? Thanks for the question, Philippe. The EDV program is something that for us is we're really excited about the impact of it in terms of reducing carbon emissions on a per mile basis is outstanding over internal combustion vehicles. And we've been able to really prove the robustness of the platform and the strength of the offering through our relationship and partnership with Amazon. Having a large deployed fleet of these before, we started running the pilot programs we've got in the past with non-Amazon customers was really helpful as we refine, not just the vehicle but also the software surrounding the vehicle.
And so as we've talked about in the past, over the course of this year, we've been running pilots in anticipation of more significant ramp-up in 2025. And this focus on pilots is really reflective of the nature of this business where -- these are large decisions around large numbers of vehicles for a lot of these bigger fleets and it's appropriate that we build effective working models for how the vehicles are serviced, what digital support the vehicles have, what infrastructure changes are necessary for each respective fleet. It's a lot different than adding a single charger in your garage by an R1 when you're thinking about adding many chargers and a lot of new power into, let's say, of a fulfillment center, a distribution center or an operating center, if you're a business that's running 20, 30, 40, 50, maybe 100-plus vans out of it. So these are great learnings that we've been driving off the basis of what we put together with Amazon, and we are looking forward to starting to talk about other customers beyond Amazon. Right. If I can squeeze another one. On the Volkswagen relationship, did I understand correctly, you expected to close in Q4. And at that point, you will disclose to the extent you are Volkswagen disclose the terms JV, we might be able to get some -- a lot of questions around the accounting and the JV and how much of the cost might be shared with the JV between regions. Will we get that information in the fourth quarter? Yes, exactly. So we'll be filing the definitive agreements associated with the Volkswagen technology joint venture once the JV is closed, which we anticipate being in Q4 of this year, and we'll provide additional clarity on some of the financial impacts of the JV to Rivian's longer-term financial forecast and trajectory as pointed to. We do anticipate seeing beyond the capital that the Volkswagen Group will provide incremental benefits, including material cost savings, operating expense efficiencies and future revenues associated with the joint venture. Next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. I wanted to go back to Mark's question earlier, and maybe you could just help us unpack some of the ASP dynamics in the quarter because we know that there was some discounting you needed to use to clear out some of the old inventory. And I guess, wondering really what the -- how we should think about the right starting point for where you were on an ASP perspective in the second quarter if we forget about some of those discounts? And just based on what you're seeing, I believe you need to hit flat ASPs from where you were in 1Q to hit the gross margin. So just anything on the right way to look about ASPs and the discounting needed for your targets? Thanks, Dan. The challenge with introducing an update or a second generation to a product, while still, of course, producing the first generation is always exactly what you just referenced, which is we -- it's not as if we stop production immediately start production have no inventory in the system. So there's inventory of our Gen 1 vehicles. And we did have some attractive pricing on some of those variants of our Gen 1 vehicles to essentially, as you said, clear them through the system as we then start producing and delivering our Gen 2 vehicles. We don't look at that as a long-term shift in pricing, but rather reflective of the step change we've seen in the Gen 2 vehicles in terms of performance and capability. And we've been very clear in just talking about the differences between the vehicles. And we're really pleased with the results that we saw in Q2 with all the number of deliveries exceed production by quite a bit, and that was really the burn down or burn through of the Gen 1 inventory.
Now in terms of ongoing expectations for ASP, the other thing I'd want to call out here is that with the introduction of the Gen 2 vehicle, clear references, but we have a tri-motor and we have a quad-motor. And the quad-motor performance is extremely high. It's a big step forward relative to our first generation one. Acceleration is a lot quicker. The range in efficiency has improved. The thermal performance for -- particularly for off-road really intense driving is outstanding and that allowed us to move the quad-motor upmarket in the tri-motor to really occupy the price position of the price space where we saw the first-generation quad operate. And so that was very intentional. And the goal was between the dual-motor, the tri-motor and the quad-motor to rate a wide band of pricing starting at just over [ 70 ] and going up over -- well into over $100,000, that allows us to not only offer vehicles to folks that are very price sensitive, but also to give products to customers that want the best of what we can build.
And so those changes happening at the drivetrain level certainly help maintain ASP. But importantly, we also have a new trim package that we've just launched, which is a more premium trim from what we had originally had. We call this the Antrim. But this Antrim package, which is built into the trial theater configurations is another element of providing customers with a variant or a choice that is at a higher price point, but of course, delivering more content and more features. Maybe just having a couple of additional points of color back to prior comments that we've made in the past. In our Q4 earnings call, we had said that we expected that our ASP for the vehicles themselves would be consistent Q4 of '23 relative to Q4 of '24. We still expect that to be the case as we sit here today. And then the other point, as we think about the seasonality of the business is consistent with Q4 of last year, it's far more indexed towards our 1 sales relative to commercial band sales, which, in aggregate, lift the overall revenue per delivered unit because of some of the Amazon-related seasonality that we expect to continue to be the case in Q4 of this year. And then back on RJ's final comments, we'll have sales of our tri-motors in Q4, which will allow us to stretch up the higher end of ASPs to complement our starting price point, which is still $69,900 for standard packs for Got it. So it sounds like there's some positive mix assumptions in there. Just as a follow-up, I wanted to go to the VW investment. And wondering from a -- the fact that you got this money and what I think many of us consider to be a more sort of efficient manner than going through the capital markets. What does this allow you to do a product plan or capacity perspective that previously wasn't on the table if you were going to be fully reliant on the capital markets. . Really important part of what this deal represents for us is it really eliminates a lot of the risk that we've seen around our balance sheet and allows us to focus the launch of our 2 still in normal, still using our normal facility. But as you've heard Claire and I both talked about as part of our Investor Day, not only have the balance sheet to support launching 2, but all of the balance sheet to support taking us through positive cash flow. And we recognize the importance of that focus on driving efficiency into the business, both in terms of how we operate the business, but also in terms of how we deploy capital from a CapEx point of view and an investment point of view. And the organization is hyper-focused on driving towards profitability and hyper-focused on the launch of our 2 and what that represents for us in terms of the scaling that comes with it. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. RJ, maybe you could just dive a little bit more what is exactly happening in the plant and what's impacting the R1 line, R2 work doing next year? And then, Claire, can we expect that the given that most of the changes are already done can ramp back up pretty quickly. So we could understand the shape of gross margins next year because it sounds like you guys are planning for maybe some sequential improvement until that downtime maybe down to third quarter and then recover in the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure that's -- we're properly calibrated there. Sure, Joe. So as we think about the operations next year, this is looking '25, we've said we're going to be taking the plant down for roughly a month while we make some of the changes necessary to integrate the R2 production into the plant. Some of that work has already happened. We did some of the preliminary work in the most recent shutdown in conjunction with the move from Gen 1 to Gen 2 on our R1 platform. But the shutdown that's going to happen in the second half of next year will make the splicing together certain parts of the plant possible. That's part of our plan. We'll be working around that, but we've -- as we did with the Gen 1 to Gen 2, we wanted to provide very early guidance around this and make sure expectations are appropriately set for what will have to happen in the plan next year to integrate R2. And then based off of the second part of your question as well, given the shutdown, there will be some chopping the financial goals as we look through not just a quarter sequential improvement in our -- as we look at the gross margin trajectory. As I mentioned in my remarks, we still maintain that we'll be -- have a modest positive gross profit for the entire year of 2025, in particular, but certainly with the shutdown itself in the second half, we'll feel some of the impacts of lower absorption of labor overhead and depreciation like we experienced in Q2 of this quarter, given the lower production volumes that we had in the normal facility itself. But to RJ's point, more akin to the November shutdown that we had to do some of the prework for our Q2 shutdown, we were able to get right back up to line rate based off of the aftermath of that shutdown. So we expect we won't see as sort of stage of a ramp back up from a production standpoint, given the fact that we have already ramped up our supply chain, which is one of the gating factors as we've gone through the course of ramping up new technologies in our redesigned Gen 2 product. Okay. And as a second question, I don't know if you guys really ever you certainly don't talk about -- talk about it this way. I'm curious if you ever look at it or think about it this way. But you called out some of the impacts to the gross loss per vehicle from stuff that's not in the cost structure this quarter. I know that's offset a little bit by regulatory credits. But if we also like take out D&A and stock comp, it seems like you're actually much closer to a cash gross profit breakeven level. Is that something that directionally is correct. And it seems like if that's true, you would actually even hit that before you would hit your modestly gross profit positive number in the fourth quarter? Yes, that's absolutely right. And we wanted to call out in my prior prepared remarks, just the impact we had roughly $15,000 of depreciation per unit, $1,200 of stock-based comp per unit and then another roughly $2,400 other cost of revenue initiatives in the quarter. So that was roughly $14,000 of loss per unit if you make those 3 respective adjustments. So we certainly would anticipate hitting sort of a cash breakeven prior to positive gross profit. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Claire, just a quick one following up on that last question. The I guess ""other initiatives,"" the $2,400 a unit, just in layman's terms, what is that? In layman's terms, the way I would characterize it is -- as you can imagine, the significant changes we made in suppliers with the introduction of swapping out roughly half of our material cost as we move from Gen 1 to Gen 2. There are certain costs associated with contract modifications or amendments that we've made, and that's largely what is reflected there. Okay. Very good. I guess my second question is on the Volkswagen joint venture. So presumably, I know you've got yet some work to do when it comes to hashing out the financial things and will await information on that in Q4. But in the meantime, presumably, you've got engineers, you've got procurement people who are sort of eager to start doing something design or getting supplier negotiations underway. Are they basically being instructed to sit tight and not do anything until the ink is dry? Or are they allowed to sort of go out into the world and start, I guess, restarting supplier negotiations, for instance, with the heft of Volkswagen behind them or working collaboratively with Volkswagen engineers to actually design the platform into Volkswagen vehicles? Or do they basically just have to sit tight? From a supplier point of view, we absolutely are already seeing some of the tailwinds associated with our Volkswagen joint venture and partnership. This is -- you can imagine at the component level and at the electronics level within the vehicle, where we see a lot of the suppliers we have long relationships with that are very excited about this and see this as an opportunity to scale beyond just the Rivian product line for the technology we've developed, but beyond that into the Volkswagen Group product portfolio. So that's been a really encouraging early read-through in terms of how it's perceived and overall looked at by the supply chain.
From a technical point of view, we about this, even with the announcement of the deal, Volkswagen Group CEO and Oliver and I just spoke around how the teams have been working really well together. And this is not -- it's not as if we do a deal of this scale and this magnitude without having done work together and we're not having done a lot of beyond diligence, but into the actual creation of work content or work product, if you will.
And so what seems on the call here, I'm going to invite him to just talk about this, but our software team and our hardware team have been working towards a number of elements that deliver on the first set of products, but the first of which is integrating our platform tactically into Volkswagen Group products. But Wassym, let me talk about this. Yes. Thanks, RJ. We're actually extremely excited with the progress that we're making in the integration -- electrical architecture integration analysis. Our engineers have been working very closely with the Volkswagen Group, and we actually have a driver with demonstrator now that contains the Arabian electronic components, the Arabian electronic software stack, and we're moving forward really, really well in understanding how our technology will scale up and down and the entire Volkswagen Group portfolio. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. My first question is more near term. Just RJ, if you could talk about demand trends you've seen since the refresh. And then -- my second question is that brand is important to everyone, but to you guys, you've done a good job of building a brand. Can you talk to us about how you measure that internally or any way that you can put context to how you've built your brand, how that extends to future models? Thanks, Ben. Ultimately, our general -- our first set of products on R1 was our handshake with the world. And they received really positively. This is 2 years ago and it was exciting as we introduced the Gen 2 of our R1 products to see how strong the media action was to those products. And recognizing we took a great fee made it even better. And -- that is something that we saw echoed across a variety of different media outlets from lifestyle to automotive to more pure technology, Alex, but recognizing the strength of what we've built. And that really serves as a wonderful foundation for the continued growth as you put it, of how we're building into our brand and how we're perceived. And there's lots of ways for us to measure that. We certainly look at things internally. We have a whole host of internal metrics that we track regularly. But I think important for the analyst and investor community, is to look at ways that third parties would look at our brand.
And most recently, actually, consent, J.D. Power does a number of ways where I look at the strength of a brand or the strength of a product offering in the market, and we've in the past done extremely well in this -- and most recently in their annual appeal study that looks at a combination of vehicle prints and its overall packaging we came out #1, and that's the #1 rated brand in their study. And to do that after having had previous #1 performance in previous years, is really exciting and it's incredibly encouraging. And we think bodes really well for what's to come with R2. If we can carry the same brand strength and the same market share penetration that we have at the premium segment where we're continually one of the best-selling veil over $70,000 today in the U.S. If we can take that market share strength and brand strength and apply it with our R2 product into the sub-$50,000 price category with R2 starting at $45,000 and our 3 pricing not yet announced, but going to be lower than R2. We're really bullish on what that represents in terms of volume. But importantly, answers a real need in the market where there's a -- I'd characterize it as a pretty severe gap in product choice for great, highly compelling EVs under $50,000. Our next question comes from Shreyas Patil with Wolf Research. First of all, curious what you're seeing in terms of opportunities in the sale of regulatory credits. I appreciate it can be lumpy. It was $17 million in the quarter. But are you seeing growing opportunities to sell right credits at this point, just given some of the struggles that we're seeing with the legacy OEMs? And the clear reference that just in regards to our top line in terms of revenue. But the regulatory credit environment is certainly very strong right now. Yes. And practically speaking, that means we have the potential to generate more revenue around our credit market than what we had originally planned or anticipated. But I think more importantly is the fact that the credit market is so strong is a reflection of the -- I'd say the decision that we have a number of companies that are going to be investing less into electrification or have less product and electrified product across multiple segments and then across different price points. And so that void of products actually creates this strong credit environment. And for us, I think the most important read through is the demand environment we see coming into 2026, 2027 is going to be very, very advantageous for us, where there's a lot of latent demand. There's a lot of demand that's sitting, waiting for the right type of product, a product that has the right form factor, product positioning, attributes and features, but folks have been siting hetero but haven't seen us, so they continue to buy an internal combustion vehicle or continue to buy a hybrid vehicle, we see this really large pool of demand on the surface that's just waiting. And we believe waiting for something that's very much like what an R2 is. Okay. Great. And my second question is, in thinking about the -- your software architecture, one of the defining elements is that it is almost entirely built in-house from the baseline operating system to the middleware hypervisor application layers. You've talked before about legacy automakers, not really having this level of vertical integration. So clearly, this is a big competitive advantage. But with VW now able to access the software platform, I'm curious how you think about the long-term advantage in software. Do you still see potential to maintain an edge here over most legacy OEMs, even those that may want to replicate your approach, or do you feel that the industry will eventually catch up and essentially, this is -- essentially, this is now an opportunity for you to monetize this asset and help the industry make the transition to software-defined vehicles? There's a few ways to speak to this. I think first, before we get to product differentiation or customer-facing advantages, building and neck architecture and a electronic stack that allows for significant consolidation of ECUs and therefore, simplification not only of the number of ECUs, but also of the harness and associated wiring infrastructure within the vehicle, that creates meaningful cost advantages relative to a traditional platform, which will have call it to 100 VC within the vehicle. And so we've talked about this, our Gen 1 vehicle at 17 in-house ECUs, we reduced that down to 7. And so it is a significant multi-thousand dollar structural cost advantage to have a network architecture and topology of computers that's far simpler and far lower cost than traditional approach. So first and foremost, there's a real cost advantage. Now of course, our partnership with Volkswagen will extend that cost advantage into their respective products as well and bring with it scale and volume, which will in turn allow us to source those components and systems at a lower cost.
But from a consumer-facing point of view, what it represents owning not just the hardware but owning the software and owning it around a really optimized architecture, as I described, is the ability to continue to make offer a lot better. So the features can not only become more rich and more robust, but they can truly improve more than just surface level skins and let's say your cluster or your center for me in display. But into like deeply into the vehicle and changing the way the vehicle performs dynamically changing the way it's charging profile set up changing battery management system characteristics, so you can have the vehicle get better and better and better over time. In a way that's very difficult when you rely on third parties to produce this complex lab rate of ECUs and all the associated software, where even small changes require coordination amongst many different players. And so things that can take us minutes can take months for attritional approach.
And so all that being said, what the customer experience, of course, beyond the vehicle performance and the way it drives and behaves, is what they see the digital environment. It's also something that the UI framework, the approach to digital design, the user experience design something that we've spent an enormous amount of time on. And we believe we'll continue to be differentiated and is facilitated and enabled by our platform, but it requires both. And we hope that by bringing this strong platform to our joint venture with Volkswagen that allows them to create products that are also really compelling and answer some of the points I made before around there is a real lack of choice. There's a -- I would characterize it as like a pretty extreme lack of consumer choice around EVs and products in the space. And in order for us to really scale towards 100% electrification, we need to have more than just a couple of highly compelling vehicles. There needs to be essentially mirror the amount of choice that we have in the combustion world, which we're not even remotely near in the EV space today. Our next question comes from Ron Jewsikow with Guggenheim Securities. RJ, you've talked in the past about as Rivian opens new spaces, order intake in those geographies accelerates. I know you've laid out the plan to 2025 for spaces. But is there any way to think about what is launching in the coming quarter or the second half of this year just to think about demand being an important part of your bridge to gross profit in the fourth quarter? Yes. So we have -- as you called out, we have a number of spaces that are going to be launching over the next 6 to 12 months. And those spaces are great ways for consumers to get a chance to experience our vehicles firsthand to sitting them to touch them and play with all the features. But beyond just our spaces, we've also really over the last 6 months begun activating our service infrastructure to support expansion of our demo drive program. And so we have over 60 service locations that month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, we're growing a number of those locations that do more than just service and they not only provide service, but they support test drive and demo drives as well as, of course, delivery and other sales-related activities.
And then beyond, our service infrastructure, we're also continuing to build out our Rivian a venture network. That's our DC fast charge network. And that's another touch point for customers to experience the brand. Today, that network is close to being for Rivian only. But later this summer, we'll be opening our network up. So it will allow non-Rivian customers to use the network as well, which is a great way for folks to experience even as a brand and get exposure to the products and the exposure to us as a company. Yes. And maybe just a follow-up on  question on credit revenues. Is -- do you feel like the $17 million this quarter or I suppose you probably know this, it's the $17 million this quarter kind of fully encapsulates or values your zero-emission vehicles? Or is there kind of more to come as we model towards the back half of this year in gross profit breakeven? Yes, Ron, as we mentioned at Investor Day, we have over $200 million of regulatory credits under contract right now for 2024 itself. And there are additional contracts in place for '25 and beyond as well. So $70 million is really just the tip of the iceberg as we think about the opportunity for 2024 and the sale of our regulatory credits. And our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. I think two for me. The first, when we talk about gross profit progression and the expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond, the 3 kind of key points that were laid out, Claire, can you just talk about are there any that you have more or less confidence in and are more or less visible at this point? Sure. As we think about the visibility that we have into the 3 drivers, which for everyone's benefit is variable cost improvement, fixed cost leverage and increase in revenue per delivered unit. On the first piece, and that one, as we sit here today, the contracts with our supplier partners are under contract. So we have clear visibility into the cost-down efforts that we'll see from a material cost trajectory there. Similarly, as we think about the fixed cost leverage that will be enabled by our production ramp in the second half of the year as we increase volumes. And then the other component is the reduction in depreciation expense. As RJ  alluded to earlier in the call, we're now anniversarying our 3 years post starter production. And so part of the reduction in our depreciation expense is related to fully depreciating some of our initial tooling associated with our launch. So again, we have clear visibility into the trajectory on that component of it as well. And then the final component as you think about the increase in revenue per delivered unit. On this end, again, we're ramping right now our set drive unit line that will enable sales of our tri-motor that allow us to skew a little bit higher from a mix perspective. And then I just referenced the regulatory credits again, that are under contract for this year as well. So we have a lot of visibility as we look into the second half performance. Great. That's good color. I appreciate that. And the other quick one, and I'm not sure if you comment on this or not, CapEx for '25, any parameters we should be thinking about? Yes. So as we think about CapEx for 2025, as we've mentioned in the past, we estimate that spend to be roughly in the $1.5 billion area. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe for any closing remarks. Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're really excited with the progress we're making the transition to our second generation R1 vehicles and the associated cost structure that, that drives both at the bill of materials level, but also within our operations within our plants, is a really important stepping stone for us as a business. And the efficacy through which that launch occurred really reflects the growing capability for us of the business. I'm also really excited to see what we're -- help customers have continued to track to the product and seeing how favorably the second-generation R1 was seen and continues to be seen really sets up well for us with what's to come with R2, where R2 leverages a lot of the content, particularly around the network architecture, the issue, topology, the software stack, and even beyond that into some of the componentry architecture that we've laid out with the updates to the R1 platform.
So again, thanks, everyone, for joining. We're looking forward to continued progress and continued efforts to drive to profitability and look forward to speaking to everybody soon. Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","the second quarter 2024 Earnings conference call is being recorded . the call will focus on both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures . we will also be making statements about our business, operations and financial performance .",0.0
