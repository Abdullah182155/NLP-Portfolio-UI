Welcome to the Motorola Solutions First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time.
The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.
At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the line will be opened for your questions following the presentation.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference. Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2018 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bruce Brda, Executive Vice President, Products & Solutions; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
I'll now turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.
First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15%, with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region led by North America organic growth of 8%.
Second, we're raising full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full-year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5%, and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85.
And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year, including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606.
Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7%, including $39 million of favorable FX.
During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission, which had historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses.
For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS, which occurred in Q1.
GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year.
GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 billion versus last year. Products segment backlog was up $166 million or 11% and Services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%.
Q1 Products sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year and growth in every region. North America Product revenue was up 14% in the quarter. Q1 Products segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales.
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard ASC 606.
Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed & Support Services grew 21% to $496 million, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions.
Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued Managed & Support growth.
Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed & Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%.
Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million, FX added $12 million and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business.
For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017.
Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%.
Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year.
Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017.
Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy Iridium settlement in India and $50 million of costs related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant.
During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt, which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and use $400 million from our credit revolver, as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million.
Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15%, with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full-year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February.
Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5%, with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance. This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds, versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance.
EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85, versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.
Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant with approximately $0.04 of EPS, net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million with approximately $0.01 of EPS.
Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 15%, with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR products and services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period.
And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year. EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services, including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year.
And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% and growth in both Products and Services, including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong Services demand.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the State of Florida to build and manage a new statewide public safety network. This multi-year award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio.
Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed & Support Services contract with the State of Maryland, a $20 million Managed & Support Services contract with the State of Indiana, a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade for Miami-Dade County in Florida, a $6 million Managed & Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America, and we announced the LEX L11 mission-critical LTE handheld device for global broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S.
Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and Next-Generation 911.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with two thoughts. First, Q1 was a great start with overall growth of 15% and organic growth of 10%, but I'm particularly pleased with our record backlog position, which further reinforces my confidence in raising our full-year guidance.
Second, I want to update you on our progress with the UK Home Office and our Airwave contract. Since I last referenced this a couple of months ago at our Financial Analyst Meeting, our discussions have been ongoing, active and productive. As a result, we now believe the Airwave contract will be extended by five or more years.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. Operator, would you please remind our callers how to ask a question? Certainly. The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thank you. Wanted to ask about organic growth. So, clearly, very strong start to the year. Can you just expand a little bit more on what's behind that strength and just the biggest sources of upside you saw versus 90 days ago?
And then the second part of the question. So, guidance for 5% for the full-year organic implies a little bit of a decel as we get through the balance of the year. Just wondering if there are any big drivers of that we should be thinking about, or if it's more just conservatism given where we are in the year at this point? Matt, I think that on the first part I just think the overall demand is strong, which is reflected in our performance both for Q1 and embedded contextually in why we're raising the full year.
Now, it's worth noting that in Q1 we had the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in a Q1. That was four times larger than the next largest shipment, and that's great.
But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%, second half is 4% and the full year is 4%.
I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up. We don't look at it as a deceleration normalized for that large order. We look at it more as a constant linearity of demand throughout the year. Got it. And then, for my follow up so, Greg, you closed out your prepared remarks talking about Airwave. Just, first, curious when do you think ultimately that will get to the resolution and that will be a finite thing that will come through?
And second, just on the Services backlog. Is there any increase from Airwave in there? Or is that Omnicom when we think about the additional five years that you talked about? First part, I think our expectation is we would look to finalize the agreement either this quarter or next quarter. And any extension of backlog that's contemplated in that extension of that agreement is not contemplated in the overall backlog or the Services segment backlog. All right. Thank you. You bet, Matt. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate the opportunity. As we look at the Services margins. Obviously, they've been increasing well and your Managed & Support Services had a great quarter this quarter. How should we think about the Services gross margins going forward? Is there an opportunity for those to rise at an early time? (19:44) Yeah. Keith, this is Gino. Our expectation for margin for 2018 is for margin to be up slightly, even if we exclude ASC 606. Clearly, with the $75 million of incremental revenue, that's expansion in the Product segment.
So the way to think about it is we expect Services gross margin to be up year-over-year. We expect Product margins to be comparable to what they were in 2017 and, overall, we do expect margin expansion in 2018. Yes, I think Kelly Mark is doing some really good work on the Services side and on cost of goods and cost of delivery, as well as Jack. We reviewed that a few days ago. So, specifically on the Services gross margin, we do expect Services gross margin to be up this year over last year. Good work (20:44) Great. Appreciate the color. And just a follow-up for you. On FirstNet, we didn't hear anything about FirstNet I guess in the script. Any new thoughts on the progress of FirstNet and Motorola's involvement in that? We continue to work closely with AT&T. We had minimal revenue, virtually none, in Q1 from any contribution as it relates to FirstNet activity. We have talked about annual revenue guidance of $20 million to $40 million. Candidly, we're in May. We look at Q1. I know there's a lot of work to be done. I know a lot of good work is being done.
As Jack and I talk about this opportunity, I think we're going to be anchored more towards the low end of that guidance on revenue for 2018. But we continue to work closely with our customers and with our partner AT&T. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay, we can't hear you. Vijay, your line is open. Do you have us on mute? And my apologies, Vijay. Go ahead. Your line is open. Can you guys hear me now? Yes. Yeah. Sorry, I was speaking to myself. Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. My question is on the acquisitions, Avigilon and also the Plant Holdings, seem very interesting. Greg, you might have a thought process in mind as to how to, like, waterfall this or ramp this through the course of the year and through next year.
I'd like to get your thought process from a management point of view, how do you plan to take these acquisitions into the MSI sales and marketing and product complex, and how should we look from both a marketing point of view and then also from your lens, how do you ramp it through the rest of the year and over the next few years? Thanks. Yeah. So, Vijay, I'll start with – it's Jack. I'll start with Avigilon. Early days been very impressed. Avigilon is a great company. I think the thing that we've spent our time is really around creation of revenue synergy. Obviously, as Greg has alluded to in the previous call, we kept this company as operating as they were before. And we've got a couple significant opportunities.
First and foremost, the United States Federal Government. Avigilon did not sell into the Fed's space, either the federal or the military space. We have opportunities really throughout that market. And obviously, we're using our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the Federal Government.
The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like, safe city, the Detroit Green Light like projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after.
And the last thing is really heavy industry or enterprise Fortune kind of 300 kind of companies in both North America but throughout the world, and we're also looking to work closely with them on that.
So, from an Avigilon perspective, obviously great company. We think we've got opportunities. We've talked about our growth rates in 2018 for Avigilon as we modeled them are comparable to 2017. And I think that was the question. Was there a follow-on, Vijay? Were you also (24:20) Yeah. I think, yeah, the follow-on was around OpEx. I mean, honestly, the company has been doing a much better job, more credit to you and team, on OpEx as a percentage of revenues. That said, how should we think about this line item through the course of the year? So, Vijay, this is Gino. From the full-year, OpEx we expect to be $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion in 2017. Approximately $200 million of that comes from the acquisitions from Plant and Avigilon, and $75 million from ASC 606, which is the accounting change.
The underlying business we continue to expect to be down approximately $20 million from 2017. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, Vijay. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. This is Kyle on for George. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to ask a little bit more about Avigilon and how you think that now that it's layered in, what it does to the steady state kind of market growth rate of the combined company?
I know that it's a smaller piece of the business but I believe it was running at, at least a high-teens growth rate. So, just wanted to see if I can get your thoughts on how you see kind of the combined company growth through the end of the year 2018 and into 2019? Thanks. Yeah. Kyle, a couple of things. As Jack just referenced, I think there's a number of ways we can extend, expand the Avigilon reach with: A, into the federal business; B, with global partners; and C, working with our direct sales team in the commercial markets, utilities, oil, gas and other critical verticals.
I think the way we're modeling this business and what's contemplated in our full-year growth is a double-digit revenue growth comparable to last year. Look, they were a public company. You've seen what they did. I think they were $353 million to $408 million, publicly traded on the Vancouver Exchange. That kind of growth rate is our current expectation by the way.
I mean, I think we want to be very prudent in modeling the business and don't get out ahead of our headlights. But there's no question the demand is pretty strong. Video is there. I think there's tremendous synergies and we'll update you accordingly between execution between now and the end of the year. Great. Thanks. And I know that Avigilon, obviously, had more exposure to the commercial sector versus government. And how much has that changed your total company exposure in terms of commercial as a percent of sales? I know that you've historically been 70% to 75%. Has that changed much for Avigilon? I think it's too early to tell. I mean, we're about 75% government and public safety and 25% commercial markets overall. Obviously, the opportunity is open-field running on federal and public safety. I think it's too early to predict a revenue composition per se, but clearly the opportunity is there. Okay. Thanks. And one quick last one. How much in terms of the backlog did the Avigilon and Airbus acquisitions add to backlog? And then, do you have a quantification of the ASC 606 impact on backlog? Yeah. Kyle, this is Gino. Avigilon doesn't come with a tremendous amount of backlog. It's in-quarter activity. So it was minimal. The Plant backlog was about $200 million and there was the last – oh, ASC 606 was a reduction in backlog of a little over $100 million. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And congrats on the quarter. Really fantastic results, so looking forward to hearing more. Thanks. All right. Thanks, Kyle. Yeah. We were pleased with backlog. It is very seasonally normal for this business, where overall backlog declines from a very robust Q4 into Q1. It was flat, which I think is another demand indicator, positively in terms of the trends and what we're seeing. Yeah. Sure, great. Thanks. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. This is Mike Koban on for Adam Tindle. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit more on Avigilon. So I'm just wondering if there's any more like investments or if there's any maybe obstacles you see in the future in kind of transferring your sales force's focus from what might be chiefly government into more commercial? And then I have one follow-up. Yeah. And I'll let jump Jack jump in too. But I don't see any obstacles. And as Jack referenced, we're keeping Avigilon basically intact as a wholly-owned subsidiary. They do a different thing than we do. So I don't want to disrupt or unintendedly put any organizational or operational obstacles. This is a very well-run company.
We want to add capital to it. We want to add people to the sales force. We want to invest more. Avigilon is all about top-line growth. So I think it's a channel story, which is why it sits under Molloy, both direct, indirect and federal. And Jack's been given the green light by Gino and myself to provide the necessary capital investment to facilitate the growth that's in front of it. Yeah. And Greg, maybe just one follow-on. Mike, so from an enterprise and commercial market perspective, frankly, they do a superb job. They've got a channel that serves that market very well. So we think the incremental lift we can provide them, maybe at some heavy industry kind of companies I talked about. But interestingly enough, they don't do much business because they were a smaller company and they found that the business turned better, focused on enterprise securities space. They haven't focused on public safety.
Now, we have done large cities. Obviously, we manage the City of Chicago's video network, which is the largest public safety video network in the country. We've done Cleveland and the Detroit project as well. So we really – frankly, James Henderson and I have talked about this. We look at government and public safety as, frankly, open space. And we think that is a market, obviously, our sales team knows very well and we think there's only uplift as it applies to public safety and government in terms of Avigilon. Got you. Thanks. Thanks. Great color. And then, about FirstNet, just it looked like AT&T, I think they said recently that they were planning to hit about 20,000 sites in 2018. And I was just wondering if that was – how do you view that as maybe like an acceleration about what you expect? I know you touched on your kind of expectations for them. Just kind of wondering how the overall ramping process is moving along as far as in relation to how you expected it to go? Well, remember, FirstNet through the lens of us, the partner, provides economic contribution in three ways; device sales, mainly push-to-talk device sales; mission-critical software applications; and thirdly, interoperability between LMR and public safety LTE.
Now, AT&T reported recently, they talked about some traction and uplift on their own results. I won't speak for them as it relates to FirstNet. But, for us, what matters is FirstNet users that are utilizing push-to-talk and we can only report on our end.
And again, as Jack referenced, the revenue contribution was virtually $0 in Q1. And the low end of guidance that we're anchoring now more toward on the $20 million to $40 million simply reflects our expectation based on the current view and Q1 around FirstNet's ability to provide economic impact to us, mainly through push-to-talk or related push-to-talk. Got you. Thanks. Great. That's all I got, guys. Thank you. Okay. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions. First up, as we layer in the Avigilon business, how do we split out the Product from the Service component of that business? And what does it do to recurring? I think you exited last year with about 28% recurring. I imagine it's a lower proportion, probably doesn't impact it much, but would be good to know how that evolves. Avigilon is primarily Product and has very little recurring. Overall, by the way, just from a Motorola Solutions standpoint, our recurring revenue was 34% coming out of Q1 as an overall enterprise, which of course we like.
Now Avigilon has very little recurring revenue. So, as more that revenue gets contemplated and factored into the full year, that number may compress a little bit. But absent Avigilon, we like the annual recurring revenue trends of the inherent business. And the recurring revenue trend originates in the higher Service growth rate? Or is it the nature of the contracts that you're entering into? I think it's primarily driven by a higher Managed & Support Services growth rate. Got it. Thank you very much. Which by the way was 21% in Q1, with 13% organic contribution. It was strong. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Pleaes go ahead. Thanks very much. In your prepared comments, you mentioned about a very large shipment which happened in Q1 that was supposed to be happening later in the year.
My question to you is, does that open up the potential for other large shipments earlier in the year because the customer has received those shipments, they'll be testing, using, implementing, rolling them out, something great? And also is there a Service element attached to those which also again potentially kind of earlier than expected? Jim, it's Jack. And I believe the question was around the large shipment that Greg referenced in the prepared remarks. We always had that $60 million opportunity factored into the revenue in the year. We were going through some bureaucratic challenges within the customer and we were able to alleviate and work through.
And so, obviously, we moved the deal early into the year into Q1. But no, that $60 million, we shouldn't think of that as something that was based on timing. We just accelerated the full project and turned the revenue in the first quarter. And I think his other question was, do you see any Services content that could attach to that shipment. Minimal. Okay. It was a device sale. So it's minimal. Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate all the details and clarification. Thank you. Gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. I think that will do it for this afternoon. Thank you for your time. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately three hours.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions' Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.
At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the line will be opened for your questions following the presentation.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference. Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2018 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bruce Brda, Executive Vice President, Products & Solutions; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter.
Second, our outlook. We're raising both, revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position coupled with our Avigilon acquisition provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few – some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our segment reporting. The new segments are Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment.
Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes Managed & Support Services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and WAVE solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing.
Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase.
Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments.
Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform.
We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond in both Services and Software. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million, compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million, compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%.
Turning to cash flow, Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year.
During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during the second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition and we paid dividends of $84 million.
Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13% with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72 based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance.
We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.
Looking at regional results, Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas' growth was driven by strong demand for LMR products and services, as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year.
EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. In Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million five-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services.
In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multi-year support agreement for a large county-wide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multi-year managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations with Q2 growth in the high-teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products.
And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Products and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically – it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, so we get to as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Thanks. Two questions. Just can you size the Hytera band in terms of, if they can't sell in the market, what you think that provides in terms of incremental revenue? And then also – well, hold on. Excuse me, and then also could you talk about any opportunities that are out there to buy new service businesses that are out there in terms of driving incremental recurring revenue? Thank you. Yeah, Walter, how are you doing? As it relates to Hytera, first of all, we're very pleased with the progress on Hytera. We won a court ruling in the ITC in July and we recently won a ruling in Germany and Mannheim federal court for patent infringement. As you probably know, just a few weeks ago, less than 10 days ago, we filed an additional copyright infringement lawsuit, which basically is effectively than copying source codes. So, we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever we need to do to protect our IP and we feel very good about the progress we're making.
We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside and ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in Düsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know but that's my view on Hytera.
In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services' side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for ""many Airwaves"". There might be one or two that materialize this year, hard to say, but we're always looking given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So, we'll continue to evaluate accordingly. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Yeah, thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Greg, Gino. Two questions quickly. One would be on constant currency organic growth rate, if you could comment on that for this year? And then a quick follow on would be Avigilon, the strategic asset, Gino, any update on that in terms of how is it ramping here in the U.S. market? Thanks. Yeah, Vijay. On organic growth constant currency, our view remains unchanged for the full year. We've talked about it being about 4% for the full year. Actually, given where we are through the strong first half and our guidance contemplated in the second half, it's probably slightly higher than that on an annual basis for organic growth constant currency. So, we feel pretty good with that. And that's in the face of growing backlog, so I think that that combination is a good one. Perfect. And a quick Avigilon update? Yeah. I mean I'll let Jack – Avigilon is going ahead of our business plan, internally ahead of our expectations. I think Jack and team have done a very good job. It's all about getting them new routes to market. They have a world-class product, 800 plus patents, a great patent portfolio. And the combination gives them exposure to state and local public safety, expanded commercial markets. The federal business, which I think could be quite substantial, probably our largest opportunity at least in the near term. And I think it's going well. Yeah, Greg. I think the only thing I'd follow on to that is the thing, Vijay, we've been most impressed with their speed of product deliverables. I mean they came out with anomaly detection here in the last 60 days. There's more to follow, so good news there. And I think as Greg said, our fundamental role is to bring them scale, to bring them coverage not only in North America as Greg said with the federal, state, and local business, but as we look to our international distribution partners, our international sales teams in places like the UK, bring them incremental scale in terms of routes to market. And that's really been the full focus here in the last 90 days. Our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Thank you. Two questions if I could. First, just on the backlog and revenue visibility. Greg, obviously, it's up a good bit. We are looking at a little bit lower year-over-year growth rate next quarter than what we've seen. And so, is there anything in there about kind of timing or, Gino, of that backlog of note, and just maybe if you could just talk a little bit about kind of that visibility into the second half and into the next year?
And then just on the follow-up on the margin front, it sounds like you're expecting a good margin move in the Software and Services business. Could you talk a little bit about what you're expecting or any opportunities on the Products and Systems Integration side? Thank you. Yeah. Tim, first of all, on Q3 guidance, it's very important to note that the majority of the unfavorable FX is in Q3, number one. Number two, most importantly, the U.S. Federal close falls in Q4 this year, not Q3. So, I think a better way that's more informative to look at the firm is the second half and the first half and not Q3 specifically given the federal close is going to fall in Q4 for us.
On Services and Software, as Gino and I have already mentioned, I think that there's a meaningful operating margin improvement in 2019 and beyond. I think – we're looking for something more like 30% operating margins or close to 30% operating margins for 2019. And I don't think there's any reason to stop there on that segment. And on the Products' side, we'll continually work on that front too. And Tim, we certainly expect comparable gross margins in 2018 versus the prior year, and we expect that to continue. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Hey, Greg and Gino. If you've already addressed this, I apologize. I'm juggling calls tonight. But first off, Gino, the statement you just made about gross margin. You all previously referenced that you've turned your focus or turning your focus to gross margin and driving uplifts and what you've done with driving down your OpEx revenue and that you've had multiple levers there.
So my question to you is relative to your – the statement you just made, what is the opportunity both from a timing magnitude standpoint and the qualitative drivers? And then if you're – again if you've already said it, I apologize, but I was hoping you could give an update on UK Airwave and ESN? Yeah. On the first one, I mentioned focusing on Services and Software driving towards significant operating margin expansion, kind of, as a marker for 2019 getting closer to 30% operating margins. I think to your point, Paul, that will come out of a combination of AGM, above gross margin, and OpEx. But our belief is that the opportunity, probably in that segment, is more on the gross margin side.
As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view and my view is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay – be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution.
And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the UK Home Office solution between those two will look more and more like FirstNet here in the States. I think at the end of the day there's a few ingredients in the blender if you will that we'll take under consideration, there's political, there's practical, there's financial, and we'll evaluate all of those with the customer to make sure that we ensure the best agreement for our company. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies. Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. This is Kyle on for George. A quick one on Avigilon, you mentioned previously that Avigilon was mostly product in your previous segment categories. Now that you're pulling software out of that and I guess Avigilon might have had some integration as well, how do you expect Avigilon to split between the two new segments? I guess another way to ask that is, how much of Avigilon is coming from software as a percentage of sales? Yeah, Kyle. It's Gino. In rough terms, about 20% of Avigilon is software. Yeah. Okay. Great. And then – sorry. And then... No, go ahead. They recently launched a cloud subscription service in March. I'm wondering if there's anything you could add in terms of any traction initially that they're getting with that or I guess do you see it being incremental to the hardware-only sales motions that they had previously, or is it going to replace something that they're already doing? Any additional color on that would be great. Yeah, Kyle. So – this is Jack. So, they've announced Avigilon Blue, which you referenced is a cloud-based solution. Early days, we've had success obviously starting to sign-up customers. I think the interesting thing with Avigilon Blue is we actually believe it will open up new opportunities into the small- and medium-sized business. So not – think of it not as cannibalistic to their existing business – but actually customer expansion in terms of its opportunity and what we can deliver. Okay. Great. Awesome. And one last one for me, on your Services and Software segment and the margin improvement that you're getting there, just curious if you can add anything in terms of what's driving that? Is that scale in the managed services business? Is it a greater mix of software, pricing activity, a combination of all those things? Anything else you can add would be great. Yeah. I think it's a couple of things. Mainly, Andrew Sinclair has talked about and he mentioned this at the Financial Analyst Meeting that while we're the only ones building an end-to-end platform there, we have the opportunity to build an integrated suite. And as a result of different acquisitions we've made, we've had some duplicative R&D. And we have to, at the end of the day, platform that comprehensive solution. As he does that over the next 12 to 24 months, I think there's margin improvement associated with that.
The second is what you mentioned. I think there's continued scale opportunities on the services' side, not only in back-office delivery as we optimize and add additional managed services contracts, but I think we can and will do a better job more efficiently on field deployment as well. So, those are the biggest opportunities that present themselves, and Jack and Kelly and Andrew and Bruce have identified those and are beginning to work those now. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Okay. Thanks and good evening. Greg, you mentioned kind of building a recurring revenue stream on that new segment line. And I just wanted to know, do you have a recurring revenue target mix? And how much do you think that you need mix from that to get to that 30% operating margin that you were talking about for 2019? We don't have a target. Obviously, we'd like to see it grow. But quite frankly, both segments are important and we anticipate growth in both segments continually. My assumption around operating margin improvement in – let's just take 2019 – doesn't necessarily assume any dramatic difference in contribution of the 32%. I think we can get after its existing stream now and get better flow through on the P&L. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And, Gino, I just wanted to check in on cash flow guidance for the year. I think you'd need about $1 billion in operating cash flow in the second half in order to hit the previously stated guidance and it'd be more than 100% of net income conversion. Can you maybe just reaffirm, does that cash flow guidance still stand and then talk about the buckets that help with those assumptions? Thank you. Yeah, Adam. It certainly still stands. We feel incrementally better about the $1.4 billion, and historically that's been our conversion, to over 100% of net income. Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research Company. Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up. When you look at surveillance and NextGen 9-1-1 today, those opportunities, could you talk a little bit about how you see the budget availability for those projects and initiatives right now? And then if it's not there, when you do talk to a customer and they decide to make the decision to move forward, can you walk us through the process of approximately times for that start to translate to revenue as they work through deriving the funding and getting that money realized? Ben, this is Jack. First of all, good question. There's two things. One of the reasons we've made the acquisitions in the command center and the organic R&D investments we've made is because we looked at that as being a distinct and additive funding stream to our customers. We didn't necessarily play in the 9-1-1 funding space before. So, as you start to drill that down in any particular project, typically these command center – 9-1-1, radio console, computer-aided dispatch – are around a two year selling cycle.
Typically, they would – sometimes they'll write it homegrown – oftentimes they'll hire a consultant. They'll put it out for RFP. They'll down select into maybe two, sometimes three vendors, at which time we'll go through a demonstration. After the demonstration, there's typically anytime – anywhere between a three- to six-month process whereby they make an award decision, negotiate a contract and then have to take it to a county board. So all in, you're typically looking at a two-year sales cycle, but the important thing for us was it was incremental to government capital budgets. It's 9-1-1 money, which was new money that we had no ability to compete for in the past. Okay. And then, on another item, we're going on maybe six or seven years removed from the sweet spot of the narrow-banding initiative. And I'm curious if you've seen any layering effects where some of those customers who are starting to come back to the table with refreshed behavior on handhelds or anything else if you feel like you're starting to see some of those customers coming back to the table? Thanks. Ben, we are – I mean, I think that typically if we look at it, it was early 2010, 2011, 2012. I mean, it was really a three to four year kind of period where different customers depending on their planning made investments. So, we think there are – we think there's opportunities. And obviously through our Know Your Customer and data-driven sales initiatives we've run, we've been in front of those customers. The thing that the sales teams also excited for is as Bruce and his team have made investments and we've got some portfolio expansion underway, which we're actually excited about as we look into 2019. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Thank you, Greg and Gino. I have one question for each of you and I'll ask them at the same time and you can take them in any order you want. Potentially, this one might be more for Greg, but there's a lot of articles out there about the FirstNet devices, the enabled devices, once they get up and running that they'll be heavily subsidized at first. Is that true? And does that impact your financial model at all? Who's the subsidy provider there on that? Or is it more that's what the media says and maybe those are test devices? How should we think about the subsidies on some of those devices?
And then my second question, which is probably more for Gino is, you had a very good Financial Analyst Day earlier in the year and a lot of the investors and buy side and sell side are feeling very comfortable with your financial liquidity model. And now it appears you're making some changes for. What's really behind the model changes for your reporting structure? Are there certain things you really, really, really want to drive home to focus on in the next few years? And then, are there a few things that we need to deemphasize that maybe you have historically in the past? Thank you. Yeah, Jim. And the answer to your first question, no. What you referenced on FirstNet and subsidies doesn't affect the way we are modeling the business or thinking about FirstNet either this year or beyond. By the way, FirstNet revenue contribution was virtually zero again for us in Q2 as it was in Q1. I think that the kind of subscriber that we were looking for hasn't materialized there. That's fine. A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push to talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us.
So that's a good thing. But – and also I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan. So, we don't see material growth in FirstNet to-date and our expectations for the full year in 2018 are minimal. And Jim, this is Gino. With respect to the new segment reporting, really, many reasons behind it. Really the idea, when we talk to services, historically, it was a combination of managed and support services and systems integration and they're two very different things with different margin profiles and invariably with the discussion centered on managed and support services. So, the effort is to be clearer about the new Services and Software is overwhelmingly recurring, clearer about our recurring revenue business versus the one-time Products and Systems Integration business and the different operating margin profile associated with each one of them. Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarification. Just appreciate it. Our next question comes from William Fitzsimmons of Morningstar. Mr. Fitzsimmons, you may want to check your mute switch or return to your telephone handset. Your line is open. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. First for Gino, the new segment breakout obviously provides some good clarity into recurring revenue. If possible, could you provide any additional clarity or possibly a percentage breakdown of revenue that both Avigilon and then your public safety command center assets contributed to the top line in the quarter?
And then maybe I'll concurrently give my question to Greg. Obviously, Avigilon and your public safety command center assets continue to grow briskly. But it's almost as if the past couple of quarters and at your Analyst Day, basically assert that core LMR demand is very strong. Are there any additional insights you can kind of give us into what's helping drive that? Obviously, the economy is doing very well and Motorola continues to do well relative to competitors. But are there any additional conversations you've been having lately with your customers when you go to market? Thank you. Yeah. I think – thanks, William – I think on the overall demand, there's a combination of things. Obviously, the economy here in the U.S. and North America as our anchor tenant, continues to perform very well. It's not often we see synchronized global growth in each theater. I think it's a combination of things. Environmentally, the environment's good; demand for Land Mobile Radio systems and people understand its criticality is high, and it's pretty high consistently.
I think there's also things internally on the management side, whether it's compensation adjustments, sales coverage, stronger indirect channels, EMEA work that was done very well by Viv Francis and Mark Schmidl out there, I think execution is better. By the way, there's better products as well. And I'm talking LMR. Not just this year but some things on tap for next year. So, the inorganic growth is excellent and the organic growth is excellent. And I think we largely are either holding or taking share and the execution is pretty sound. I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything on that? No. I think you nailed it, Greg. And, William, on the segment reporting, well, we won't dimensionalize subsegment what we have talked about the relationship between software and services within the segment if software being approximately $400 million for the full year. And you can think about that as the starting point in the new Services and Software segment. Perfect. Thank you both. Our next question comes from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Regarding Airwave, I may be missing some of the nuances here. It sounds like it's extended for many years, the same magnitude and mix moving forward as well. Well, we don't know. Ultimately, we'll see how the agreement plays out. I think the discussions with the customer remain ongoing. There could be different terms with different financial contributions that we continue to weigh back and forth with them. But our view is completely unchanged that we think that network will be in for a very, very long time beyond 2020. And as I referenced, we made also great progress on ESN and what the customers call the re-plan or the reset, which I think will be a standards-based solution vis-à-vis Kodiak.
By the way, with that extension of Airwave, obviously, there'll be device opportunities that are contemplated. And given the fact that Airwave will be in for much longer, Jack's team has already engaged in conversations with the customer this year and I'm sure that will go into next year for device refresh because of the new understanding that Airwave will be extended. So, are we to assume that the overall economics, hoping much of a wash relative to what you see today? Obviously a different mix. Well, I think at the end of the day, if I were to answer that, it would really be speculative because we're still in discussion with the customer. But I would expect in the not too distant future a matter of months to be able to provide the clarity, both around the term and the financial contribution associated with it. And we feel – I'd just say this – we feel very good about where we are in the planning cycle. Got it. Okay. And then just quickly on the end-to-end solution in software for the first responder market. It does sound like you've got a huge head start over everyone else in a very fragmented space. And yet in the context of the software, which is fairly modest proportion of your overall revenue, it doesn't feel like it's going to be particularly material any time soon, but am I mistaken, I mean, can you see this being 5%, 10% revenues in the next couple of years? So, Paul, this is Bruce Brda. I'll take the question. With the footprint that we have from the assets we've either bought or built, we're in over 70% of the public safety command centers in North America. That gives us the ability as we platform to cross-sell across applications. So, we think we're extremely well positioned. As you pointed out, the market is fragmented and nobody has an end-to-end suite of solutions like us. We've built a really good set of assets there. As Greg said, we expect this segment to grow at a rate faster than Products and SI, and software will be one of those contributors. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research Holdings. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A question for you here on Avigilon. Avigilon has been in your portfolio now for several months. And you guys have high-teens growth as you guys mentioned. Just want to know, are your starting to see some of the synergies that you expected or is it still too early and this is true, just organic growth from the company that you acquired? Keith, we are. I think we are seeing some revenue synergies. I'd caution the one thing as we talked about, laid out in the front and even when we first made the acquisition, we felt like our biggest synergy was going to be in the U.S. Federal Government and it's the U.S., state, local governments. And I'd just mind you the sales cycle on those things, as I just noted, is minimally a 12 month kind of sales cycle.
And so work done, pipeline being built. By the way, incremental sales investment that we think was needed subject matter expertise in public safety, it's underway. So that's the first thing. The second thing was our North America channel. We got to, obviously, have a very strong and proud channel, many of which carry competitive video solutions.
So, we're now working with those channel partners, obviously, to go and bring Avigilon into their portfolio. And obviously with the loyal relationship that we've had with those, we actually are starting to see not only some opportunities but some deals that have been closed, that are Enterprise-like deals that will close a little quicker than the larger government solutions that we're working on. Okay, great. And then it looks like (42:41) obviously are Chinese based. And it looks like they're going to be blocked from being able to do (43:14) government infrastructures and obviously OEM (43:16) other guys out there. Is there a way to quantify or think about the opportunity you guys may have from those guys being excluded from being (43:00)? Yeah. Well, I mean, there is – as you referenced – the Authorization Act was approved by the House and Senate, it's awaiting the President's signature. It's clearly a positive. But I think the most important is the country and the government's doing the right thing from a national security and intellectual property protection standpoint. There's companies that are named specifically in there. We haven't modeled anything this year or next year, but I'm heartened and pleased that the government is taking these steps. And I think there'll be procurement guidelines and grant prohibitions around how Chinese electronic companies are purchased and/or deployed and what they're eligible for from a grant standpoint, that's in the NDAA, that I think is positive for us. But most importantly, I think from a national security standpoint, the country is doing the right thing. Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Hi. Thank you. The first question I have is, you did mention a little bit about command center a little bit earlier, but what I really want to know is as you enter this market and you further expand – and I know you have some discipline and some knowledge regarding your customers, et cetera – what I really wanted to know is like how are you measuring uptake and when should we really start to see statistics on specifically this dynamic? And is there any competition coming up that you are potentially facing in the market for this service? Yeah. This is Bruce. I'll take the question. I'm sure Jack will jump in. This market is extremely fragmented. I think that was mentioned earlier. And with the assets we've bought and built, we have a complete suite. Nobody else comes close to what we have done. In the short term, cross-sell between those applications is the short-term opportunity. And that's really being led by the integration that we're doing between the individual applications that adds incremental value to the customers.
Jack, I'll see if you want to add anything on top? Yeah. So, Sami, it's really we kind of looked at is we had a multitude of products in the command center. We've now moved to where we're selling coupled solutions. And we've had very good success, particularly with the Emergency CallWorks and the Spillman acquisition that are really kind of mid-tier cities. And we've had in the twenties where we've gone in and sold those things as coupled solutions in the U.S. alone.
As Bruce and team start to build that into a platform, that's where we start to have multiple opportunities within given years within the same customer. So, it's really an evolution for us in the command center, but I think we've got the right focus, resource, and we've seen early wins, particularly with the acquisitions as I laid out with Emergency CallWorks and Spillman. Got it. Thank you. And then just – so, it clearly looks like you have control over this part of the market. And when customers are not upgrading or not opting into this service, what is the rationale? Is it budget? Is it head count? Is it skill? Like what exactly is the bottleneck and adoption for specifically this service? Could you clarify when you say that service? Do you mean Support and Managed Services or our command center applications? Command center applications? Yeah. Each of the individual applications call taking, CAD, records and councils, have typically been refreshed at different cycles in the past, which is really I think plays into our hand. So, as long as we're in with one and we're in with one in more than 70% of the PSAPS across the U.S., we have the ability as the refresh cycles for the individual applications come due to participate. And those I don't think there's any hindrance in those refresh cycles. It's not a funding issue. It's just an evolution or cycle that we have to let pass to be able to participate for the upgrades sleeve-by-sleeve in the command center. Got it. Thank you. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. No further comments. Thank you all for your time.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our 2018 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President & CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services & Software. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, and the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Chris, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 13%, grew EPS 27%, and generated more cash compared to last year on continued strength in both segments.
Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year, and now sits at a Q3 record ending $9.5 billion, and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog, related to the Airwave and ESN extensions, or the State of Florida award.
And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions, and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency. GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year, due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million, or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year, due to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was up $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings, as well as a lower tax rate. Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million, or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million, or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million, or 5%.
Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10%, primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million, or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects.
We expect full-year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million, or 9% versus last year, with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million, or 4%.
Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million, or 22% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million, or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix.
We expect full-year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28%, and continue to expect full-year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million, or 5% versus last year, driven by the Americas and Asia-Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.
Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter, due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.
Other income and expense was $43 million, compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million, compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year, due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments booked in the quarter, and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million, compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.
Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt, and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.
We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition, $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Looking at regional results, Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software, and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year. EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia-Pac, revenue was down 1%, with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.
Turning to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%.
We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7.00 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs, given our very limited exposure to China.
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command and control, and management – the management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral Vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral Vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management, and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. And thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few thoughts. First, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results that were led by North America. We see strong demand across land mobile radio products, services and software, and the Avigilon acquisition continues to perform ahead of our expectations.
Second, I like our momentum in the Services and Software segment. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion, and earnings potential of this segment going forward.
And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments of large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet, and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.
I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many people as possible.
Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Hey, I wanted to maybe start off by looking at the Q4 guidance. If I look at your revenue guidance, the tax rate, shares, earnings, seems to imply something like a 28% operating margin. And as I look back to a year ago or even two years ago, you guys were operating at somewhat higher operating margins in Q4. I get it. It's a seasonally strong quarter, but can you walk through kind of where that operating margin kind of math looks in your eyes? Is that 28% number about right? And then is it conservatism, or is it some of the costs you're carrying with some of these M&A deals? Just kind of talk through profitability there, that would be helpful. Thanks. Yeah, George, this is Gino. That looks about right, and I'll remind you that at the acquisitions, operating margin percentage is down obviously. Earnings are up, it's related to acquisitions and a little bit of ASC 606 as well. Got it. Okay. Got it. And then on the tax rate, we kind of talked about it, a little bit higher tax rate than you guys put up certainly here in Q4, and then I think maybe even your modeling for Q3 and then what you're modeling for Q4. Can you just talk about kind of what's going on in tax rate and how you see the outlook there going forward? Thanks. Yeah. So, from a tax rate perspective, maybe it's instructive to start with Q3. So Q3, 18% versus 30% last year. About half of that, George, is related to the tax legislation. The other half is split between return to provision estimate and deemed dividends and stock compensation. So as we look forward, we guided the 22.5% ETR for the full year, and as we look into next year a little bit, the tax rate, our expectation is somewhere 24% to 25%. So, Q3 was a little bit lower rate based on those couple of items. Great. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Thanks. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks and good evening. I just wanted to start, first acknowledge that Q3 profit dollar growth was still very solid, but non-GAAP OpEx is growing faster than gross profit dollars, and guidance suggests this will continue. Maybe you could just talk about the drivers to this and how you think about the timing to reverse this trend. It sounds like there's some leverage on operating margin in Services and Software, but maybe touch on Products margin as well, since it looks like that's where the margins have been declining. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Sure. Adam, this is Gino. So we'll start from an OpEx perspective. Really, the increase is related to acquisitions. There's also a little bit of the ASC 606, but it's acquisition-related, and clearly, as we continue to grow revenue in those acquisitions, that will offset the incremental OpEx. The base business, the expectations haven't changed from the beginning of the year. We continue to drive cost reductions frankly in the base business, offset by increases in OpEx.
From a – the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:38). Yeah, so the way to think about PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:42) is obviously PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:44) now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional costs in the acquisitions, both from a [ph] VGM (17:55) perspective, and frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (18:03) gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year – I think I mentioned in my prior comments – to end the year at approximately 21%. We expect that to expand anywhere between 100 and 200 basis points in 2019. Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, Greg, I wanted to ask a little bit more on Software. How integrated is that business into the rest of the company? I know you've got some new segmentation, would imagine there's some separation there, and if the market's not giving you credit for it, would you think about strategic optionality, whether that's an IPO or a sale or something like that? No, I think, Adam, it's pretty integrated with our business. And I think it's – I think of the Software and I think about the critical importance driven by command center software. So, I think of three legs of the stool, I think of our land mobile radio business, I think of our command center software business, and I think of our video business through Avigilon, and then services that integrate or wrap around all three.
So as we've said, that segment is pretty much a proxy for recurring revenue of the firm. I think Andrew Sinclair on the Software side, Kelly obviously inherits now the entire segment with Bruce Brda's retirement. I feel good about this segment and its integration and interrelatedness with our business as a whole, and you saw the strong performance in Q3, and as Gino talked about, I think there's gross margin and operating margin expansion for sure in 2019, and quite frankly, beyond. So, I think it's a very key part of our strategy, and I think about it in an integrated way from a company perspective. Got it, thank you. Sure. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity to get a question here. Just as we think about Avigilon, it's been in your hands now about six months, two quarters and plus some, just thoughts on how that business is progressing. Obviously there's been some challenges within the Chinese competitors, given there's a lot of (20:13) competitive advantage, but a little bit color on how that business is doing, and thoughts about it going forward. Okay. Keith, It's Jack. So in terms of Avigilon, obviously we announced the acquisition in early February this year, through two quarters, a little bit more than two quarters of business, frankly has exceeded our expectations. So the market's about $12 billion ex-China, which has been growing at a 5% growth rate. We're essentially tripling that growth rate in the market. We are making investments in go-to-market, and continue to make investments in the portfolio as well, and we see continued leverage and growth for that business into 2019. So it's performing very well. And I'd add that – especially with the recent legislation around the National Defense Authorization Act, that prohibits the procurement of Chinese content with video surveillance, specifically Hikvision and Dahua, the opportunity is even greater than we've originally thought, I think, both for the Federal market, for sure, and we haven't had any traction, so to speak, given the sales cycle on state and local. So I'm pleased with the way Jack is running it. Remember, we're operating it as a fully contained subsidiary, but it's also important to note we're investing. We're investing in go-to-market distribution, and we're investing in development to further extend our portfolio and product lead. Feel very good about that acquisition. Great. All right, just for a follow-up to change gears slightly here for the ESN, how should we think about the ESN and when you might be able to monetize that? Is there anything that we can look at as factors about when it will start? So we still anticipate signing a contract for Airwave, ESN extensions. We're targeting by the end of the year. I mentioned that in my backlog comment. None of that is – the extension piece are not reflected in backlog. Airwave is about – and I know you talked about ESN, but just to put a marker down, Airwave is about $1.45 billion through that three-year extension. And ESN, the extension, what they call the CAN Agreement (22:38), would be signed at the same time.
I think our expectations for ESN specifically, which is your question, is reasonably modest for 2019. I think it will take some traction to get utilization and final definition and agreement, but the Airwave extension is pretty cut and dry and clear for that three-year monetization of $1.45 billion. A lot of great work by the team here with the UK Home Office. Feel good about both of those deals. Great. Thank you. Sure. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Josh Kehoe on for Jim. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide some more detail on what drove the year-over-year growth in Americas and EMEA? And are you seeing any heightened competitive pressure in APAC? Okay, Josh. So, obviously, for the Americas, continued, really it's across the board. I mean, great performance in both Product (sic) [Products] (23:40) and SI. We've grown and that's the LMR portfolio both to the government and commercial space, as well as Avigilon. And then the Software and the Services business, really that North America's the anchor point of that business, and it performed very well in Q3, really it's performed very well all year. So obviously, backlog is up 9% there, but good traction in the Americas. In EMEA, it's really been the story of Avigilon, and then the Products and Systems Integration, they're up as well. So pretty balanced story in both of our largest theaters really.
And Asia-Pac, frankly, the business has performed. We've grown in Asia-Pac this year. In fact, we plan to grow every theater that we operate within, but we've had some pressure in China, frankly, but I would remind everybody that our largest business in Asia-Pac is Australia. Australia performs exceptionally well for us. Australia, in fact, is really, frankly, more than twice as big as China for us in the region. That's our anchor tenancy in Asia-Pac, and so a little bit of competition in China and the surrounding area, but frankly, we continue to perform well in Asia-Pac as well. Yeah, and I think that's the key. I think our Asia-Pac strategy is led largely by Australia. As it relates to China, and as anticipated, it's not really significant against the overall composition of the firm. China represents about 2% of our overall revenue. We have about 170 employees in Mainland China, and as a part of a very concerted multiyear effort, we do not do manufacturing in China. We don't do product development. It is more about sales and sales support and go-to-market distribution. Great. And are you seeing any change in the duration of your backlog? Thanks. No, Josh. This is Gino. No change to the duration of our backlog as we began offering the service – multiyear service offering. So we did see a little bit of a duration extension in Services, as that represented revenue that would be realized over multiple years. But no change certainly in 2018 to our expectation of the duration of backlog in either Products and Systems Integration, or in Services and Software. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Gino and Greg. How are you? My question's on – I had just a bigger picture question. The software Command/Control in the context of managed services and also the Avigilon business are clearly the pillars or the drivers of growth heading into next year and over the next few years. So give us just some qualitative lens of how should we think of these two important growth drivers as we head into the new year. Thanks. Yeah, actually, I think we're growing across pretty much all of our platforms. You talked about Software and Services and Avigilon, but I'm very pleased with the land mobile radio business as well. Look, we're not going to guide specifically on 2019, but the way we think about it currently is the segment of Product (sic) [Products] (27:11) and Systems Integration is generally a low-single-digit revenue growth business. Services and Software, all-in, is a high-single-digit business.
And our current thinking, I feel very good about our momentum, feel very good about our record Q3 backlog, but our current thinking is organic revenue growth constant currency next year can be comparable to this year. And that's with about $80 million of FX headwinds for next year, and that current thinking also contemplates no meaningful FirstNet revenue contribution next year.
Now, having said that, from a linearity standpoint, we always have Q1 being much lighter than normal, as we look at the full year, and I think that that kind of performance for 2019 will be comparable to 2018. But that's our current thinking. Okay. Very helpful. A quick follow-on for... Vijay, this is Gino. Just very quickly, the preponderance of that FX headwind is in the first half next year. Good point. Okay. Gino, a quick follow-on on how should we think and what's your thought process on OpEx as percentage of revenue once again heading into next year? Thanks. Yeah, so Vijay, I'm not sure we're going to guide on all the elements of 2019, but I think you can expect more of the same. As Jack and Greg both mentioned, investments in the acquisition, specifically in Avigilon in terms of go-to-market and in terms of R&D, but you can continue to expect very rigorous and disciplined attention to OpEx as we go forward into 2019. And on the next call, we'll give you a more detailed view of what 2019 looks like. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Vijay. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of picayune ones, please. Amongst the pro forma adjustments, there's an environmental reserve expense, I see that some other charge number jumps this quarter. Is this something that we'll see more of? Perhaps you can just give us some sense of what this is about and characterize it (29:41)? Yeah, Paul, this is Gino. No, you should not expect to see any more. This is a longstanding EPA site related to one of our legacy businesses in Scottsdale, Arizona. And really, what it represents is, if you look at the $57 million, about $20 million is additive costs, but from a cost perspective per year in 2019, the additive cost is about $800,000. So the cost is really related to an extension beyond 2039 of monitoring that we need to do in Scottsdale, both groundwater and vapor intrusion monitoring.
And then there's also a change in the discount rate that we used. So from a cash perspective, you shouldn't expect any different cash-out position anywhere in the near term, and certainly we don't expect any additional reserves on this particular item going forward. Okay, got it. And then we got this $25 million quarter of reorganization charges. So I think that was in both 2Q and 3Q. How long does this go on for? Why should we consider it sort of one-time in nature rather than an ongoing expense? Yeah, it's really related to restructuring, Paul, and certainly we don't expect, for the organizations that we restructured, we don't expect that to recur again. So that's why it's in the column (31:28). So that's done. So we shouldn't see that again after this point? Yeah. Certainly, I mean there may be other restructuring we may do, but certainly not the restructuring that we did in Q2 and Q3. Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. That's helpful. Certainly. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thank you. Just wanted to ask on the LMR business, just a two-parter there and then a follow-on for Gino. Just, the Florida deal was obviously a large one. Any other big deals out there that are being contemplated at this time? And related to that, any – I think in the past quarter or two, you've talked about some new product launches or opportunities in the LMR area, any comments on that? And then just follow-on for Gino, as we continue to move to a little bit more Software here, when should we start to see a little bit more inflection or improvement in the gross margin line? Thank you. Hey, Tim, it's Jack. I'll take the first one and then pass the baton to Gino. So first of all, I think the first part of the question was related to big deals. Obviously, in Greg's intro, we talked about the State of Florida, which is frankly the biggest state-wide project. It was a legacy Harris customer that we've been awarded. So we have that and we have multiple other state-wide upgrades that we're in pursuit of.
The LMR project business remains, frankly, it's very robust. I would tether that comment to the fact that the team's executed very well with the portfolio that we've got a couple new product introductions. We have not announced the new product yet, but both from a command center software, we've got a lot on the horizon there, but also some nice things here in 2019 related to our devices as well. So, the sales team is very poised, very excited to take that to market. But so I think the culmination of the market drivers, state and local revenue receipts being up, very good Federal budget situation for us, coupled with new product on the horizon, it's exciting times, I think, in the Project 25 and PCR business. And Tim, this is Gino. On gross margin, the question was specific to Services and Software, is that correct? Yes. Yeah, it's kind of just overall, but, yeah, particularly in – as that mix improves, how do we think about (34:06)... Sure. So let me start with Services and Software. We clearly expect gross margin expansion in 2018 versus last year, 250 basis points. And we expect continued expansion into 2019. We talked about our expectation for operating margin to be approximately 30% in 2019 versus 28% in 2018. That's a combination of both, but we clearly expect to see continued margin expansion as we move forward in Services and Software. And that will result in margin expansion overall as well. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Tim. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your time. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

All participants are in listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
It is now my pleasure to turn today’s program over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our 2018 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services and Software. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We’ve posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. I’ll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q4 was another excellent quarter.
We posted records for revenue, earnings per share, operating cash flow and backlog. Revenue grew 15%, earnings per share grew 25% and we generated operating cash flow of over 800 million.
Second, our full year results were outstanding as well and illustrate the earnings power of our business driven by demand across our entire portfolio and continued strong execution.
For the full year, we grew revenue 15%, earnings per share 31% and generated close to 1.6 billion of operating cash flow, excluding a voluntary pension contribution and grew our backlog by almost $1 billion.
And finally, demand remains strong across our platforms in mission critical communications, video, services and software and we continue to invest for long-term growth.
So I’ll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and 2019 outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q4 results include revenue of $2.3 billion, up $297 million or 15% from the year-ago quarter, including $159 million of revenue from acquisitions and $25 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting change, was up 6%.
GAAP operating earnings were $516 million, up $13 million and operating margins were 22.9% of sales compared to 25.7% in the year-ago quarter. The lower operating margin is primarily due to costs related to the closure of certain supply chain operations in Europe and higher OpEx related to acquisitions.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $650 million, up 15% or $84 million and operating margins were 28.8% of sales compared to 28.9% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in gross margin were offset by higher OpEx related to acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share was $2.44 compared to a loss of $3.56 in the year-ago quarter. The prior year loss was driven by the effects of 2017 tax reform. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.63, up 25% from $2.10 in the year-ago quarter.
OpEx in Q4 was $484 million, up $77 million due to acquisitions and ASC 606. Other income and expense was $51 million compared to $36 million in the year-ago quarter driven by an increase in net interest expense of $12 million. Q4 effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 32.8% last year, primarily due to 2017 tax reform.
For the full year, revenue was $7.3 billion, up $963 million or 15% including $507 million of revenue from acquisitions and $83 million of revenue related to the adoption of ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting change, was up 6%.
2018 GAAP operating earnings were $1.3 billion, down 29 million or 2%, primarily driven by a charge to an existing environmental reserve, the closure of certain supply chain operations in Europe and lease exit cost associated with acquisitions.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion, up 16% driven by higher sales in gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share was $5.62 compared to a loss of $0.95 in 2017 driven by the effects of 2017 tax reform. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.15 compared to $5.46 in 2017, an increase of 31%.
For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion as expected, including $258 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Other income and expense was 165 million compared to 163 million in the prior year. And the effective tax rate for 2018 was 21.7% compared to 31% last year, due primarily to tax reform and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $812 million compared to $761 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher earnings. Free cash flow in Q4 was $743 million compared to $740 million last year. Capital expenditures were $69 million, up $48 million versus last year, primarily related to the Airwave extension.
For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, including the $500 million voluntary debt funded pension contribution in Q1 of 2018. Free cash flow in 2018 was $878 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. Excluding pension, operating cash flow was 1,575 million and free cash flow was 1.4 billion. The higher cash flows in 2018 was driven primarily by higher earnings.
Capital allocation for 2018 was $1.2 billion of acquisitions, $337 million in cash dividends, $197 million of CapEx and $132 million of share repurchases at an average price of $112.42.
Additionally, in Q4, we repaid the remaining $100 million of the revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition. And we continue to expect – to repay the $400 million term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.
Moving to segment results. Q4 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.7 billion, up $233 million or 16% driven by the Americas and EMEA. Revenue growth from acquisitions and ASC 606 in the quarter was $137 million.
Q4 Products and Systems Integration segment operating earnings were $483 million or 28.9% of sales, down 140 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions.
Some notable Q4 wins in this segment included a $47 million P25 order from Snohomish County, Washington; a $24 million P25 order for Ingham County, Michigan; and a $16 million P25 order from Riverside County, California.
For the full year, Products and Systems Integration revenue was $5.1 billion, up $587 million or 13% led by the Americas and EMEA. Revenue from acquisitions and ASC 606 was $396 million.
Products and Systems Integration operating earnings were $1.1 billion or 21.7% of sales compared to 22.7% of sales in the prior year, driven by OpEx from acquisitions. For 2019, we expect operating margins to be up approximately 100 basis points and gross margins to be between 48% and 49%, which is comparable to 2018.
Moving to the Services and Software segment. Q4 Services and Software revenue was $584 million, up $64 million or 12% from last year, driven by growth in every region and inclusive of $47 million of growth from acquisitions and ASC 606.
Services and Software operating income in the quarter was $167 million or 28.6% of sales, up 340 basis points from last year, driven by organic gross margin expansion partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
Some notable Q4 highlights in Services and Software include a $71 million services contract with Maricopa County, Arizona; the $29 million services contract from Cobb County, Georgia; a $26 million contract to provide Next-Gen 911 core services for a customer in North America; and a $16 million services contract in Australia.
Additionally, we signed the Airwave network extension through the end of 2022 for $1.1 billion with additional services from local agencies to be added during 2019. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired VaaS International Holdings, a leading global provider of data and image analytics for vehicle location. The equity used in the acquisition has been offset with share repurchases of $65 million in Q4 and $125 million in January of 2019.
For the full year, Services and Software revenue was $2.2 billion, up $376 million or 20% with growth in all regions. Revenue from acquisitions and ASC 606 was $194 million.
Services and Software operating earnings in 2018 were $631 million or 28.1% of sales compared to 25.7% in the prior year, driven by organic gross margin expansion and acquisitions. Looking at 2019, we continue to expect full year operating margins to be approximately 30% with gross margins of approximately 50%.
Looking at regional results. Americas Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 16% and growth in both segments. For the full year, the Americas revenue was $5.1 billion, up 17% with growth in both segments driven by acquisitions and organic growth.
EMEA Q4 revenue was $491 million, up 24% and was also driven by growth in both segments. For the full year, EMEA revenue was $1.6 billion, up 18% with growth in both segments driven by acquisitions and organic growth.
And Asia-Pac Q4 revenue was $202 million, down 5% on a declining Products and Systems Integration, partially offset by growth in Services and Software. For the full year, AP revenue was flat at $680 million with growth in Services and Software offset by a decline in Products and Systems Integration.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.6 billion, up $988 million or 10% compared to last year inclusive of a $205 million backlog revaluation due to unfavorable changes in currency rates.
Services and Software backlog was up $1.1 billion or 18% compared to last year, driven by an increase of $613 million in the Americas and $537 million in EMEA related to Airwave. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog was up $1.2 billion also driven by growth in the Americas and the Airwave extension.
Products and Systems Integration backlog was down $116 million or 3% compared to last year due primarily to two large system deployments in 2018 in the Middle East and Africa. The Americas backlog was up $14 million year-over-year. Sequentially, backlog was down $42 million driven by the same Middle East and Africa deployment. Segment backlog in the Americas was up $104 million sequentially.
Turning to our Q1 outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 11% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.11 and $1.16. This Q1 outlook assumes approximately $35 million of FX headwinds at current rates, approximately $140 million of revenue from acquisitions and effective tax rate of approximately 25% and approximately 174 million fully diluted shares.
For the full year 2019, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 7% with non-GAAP EPS between $7.55 and $7.70. And full year operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. This full year outlook assumes approximately $65 million of FX headwinds at current rates, approximately $230 million of revenue from acquisitions, an effective tax rate of approximately 25% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares for the full year.
I’d now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few thoughts. First, 2018 was a record year for the company built on a strong foundation. We saw continued LMR growth led by North America and EMEA and Airwave has been extended through the end of 2022. Additionally, our Services and Software segment grew revenue and operating earnings double digits and we acquired key assets in video, software and analytics.
Second, I think we’re very well positioned for another strong year in 2019 with our industry leading portfolio of LMR solutions, a comprehensive command center software suite and new video and analytics capabilities, all of which are supported by a growing services business. We serve customers in growth segments of large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet and durable growing cash flows that will drive continued shareholder returns over the long term.
And finally, a year ago at our financial analyst meeting, I provided a view of driving the company toward what I’d called 8 and 8 in 2020, meaning approximately 8 billion in revenue and $8 plus in EPS. Today, I’d like to update that and tell you we’re now driving the company towards 9 and 10 in 2021, approximately 9 billion in revenue and approximately $10 of earnings per share by the end of 2021. This current view is constant from allocation framework.
And with that, I’ll turn this call over to Chris. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I’d like to remind everybody to please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate the others. Operator, would you please remind everyone on the line how to ask a question? Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question of the day from Mr. Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thank you. So just one question, I was hoping you could update – obviously there’s been a lot of movement and some acquisition in the command center in the software space and you had talked about a 400 million run rate there. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of the trajectory particularly as you’re adding more pieces on there? And then just on the follow up, Greg, more specifically for you, those more positive numbers for 2021. So just a talk a little bit about – obviously backlog’s good all over the place, so maybe just give us some color on what’s driving the much higher confidence, which pieces of the business are you seeing the most traction leading to those increased revenues and ETF numbers? Thanks. Yes, Tim, look, as I said, I think we’re really pleased with 2018 pretty much across the board both in the Products and SI segment as well as Services and Software. I think why we feel good about going into 2019 is the record backlog position strong entering Q1, general comparability of backlog '19 against '18, but a lot of strong demand drivers. We still see continued consistent demand. We’ve talked about organic constant currency growth a quarter ago. We thought it would be 4% first half of '18, 4% second half of '18 and 4% for the full year. We actually came in a little bit higher than that on an organic growth constant currency growth rate for revenue. And we expect comparable organic growth revenue of constant currency growth in '19 as well. I think the regions that will lead that are the Americas and EMEA as well as converting some of the backlog and of course the Avigilon asset continues to perform at or above our expectations. And as Jack mentioned last quarter, a huge addressable market, about 12 billion without China and we size that market growth growing at 5%. We’re targeting growing the Avigilon asset 3x that. So I think Jack has done a great job with his team of managing the asset, increasing sales coverage, investing in that business. So when I look at LMR, when I look at the command center software suite and the progress Andrew Sinclair and Kelly are making and then overall growth of Services and Software which we continue to believe is high-single digits, PS&I low single digits. But in '19 we’re going to grow revenue with the firm, we’re going to expand gross margin with the firm, we’re going to increase cash flow despite a higher effective cash tax rate, we’re going to grow our earnings per share, we’re going to grow operating margin. So I think the team has done a really good job and I think we’re well positioned as we sit here in February of '19. Tim, this is Gino. The first part of the question was VaaS. Just kind of updating the overall software standalone or command center, however you want to look at it, revenue rate comparable to the 400 million you were talking about? Yes, I think that as you unpack the segment, we expect high-single digits for the segment of Services and Software. That comports the double digit growth of software and mid-single-digit growth of managed and support. On an annualized basis in '18, the business performed that way – actually I would say above expectations given acquisitions. But Tim as you comport that 400 million software and to lay out growth rate, think double-digit growth rate on that piece which feeds a high-single digit combined for the segment. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. And we’ll go next to George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks very much and congratulations on the good results. I guess I wanted to start by asking you about the government shutdown. Obviously it’s topical these days. I’m assuming you’ve had a minimal impact in your December quarter. And then maybe a little more impact you’d expect in Q1. But can you just talk about what mix of business comes from U.S. federal? And then what sort of impact are you seeing or do you expect to see Q4 and then now going into Q1 and beyond? Thanks. Hi, George. So first of all, any impact in Q1 has been implied obviously in our guidance and frankly we expect minimal impact. I think the second part of the question was related to the size of the federal business. It’s approximately 600 million but it’s important to note that it comes from multitude of different agencies. I think many companies in this space are defense and security. We do business with law enforcement, administration, FBI as well as providing base security as well. The last thing I would note is that our management support service business for the federal government, actually those contracts all come in largely in our fiscal Q3 which is aligned with the federal government’s close. So those things are already logged on the books. So to tie it altogether, minimal impact and we’ll have to see. No one can predict the future given the length but we expect minimal to no impact to Q1 and we’ll see how things play out in the rest of the year. Got it, okay. And then just as a quick follow up. I was just curious about Avigilon. So obviously you’re investing for growth in that business. You can see it in the margin performance. But when do you expect to start to see the revenue ramp there associated with those investments? And maybe just give us an update on where you’re investing and how that’s going? Thanks. So, George, really our investment has been twofold. First of all, we fortified and expanded our enterprise sales force. So that’s the first thing. The second thing, we hired a team specifically to get after our revenue synergies in state and local and in federal government. Those teams were all hired by the end of the year. So the net of it I think as we think about it, the second half of the year is really when we think we’ll start to see the impact of those things because we have a lot of new hires in the enterprise space. And then as you heard me relate and I think you heard Greg and Gino discuss before, the government sales cycle in and of itself typically takes 12 months. And so we started those things in the back half of last year and I think we’ll start to see some positive impacts in the second half of '19. Great. Thanks. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll go next to Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay? Vijay, your line is open. If you wouldn’t mind checking your mute function. Yes. Can you hear me? We can now. Okay. Sorry, the headset died. It’s amazing. So my question is, it’s great to see your confidence in the full year outlook, 6% to 7% versus expectations for around 5%. So help us understand, Greg, what are the drivers as detailed as you can be on what’s driving that confidence in that 6% to 7% number? Thanks. Well, you’re right. We expect 6% to 7% for the full year. I think in part, some of that top line comes, as I mentioned, from the backlog position and the record backlog position that we have exiting '18 coming into '19. Additionally, there’s top line revenues that are coming from acquisitions both Avigilon at least in Q1 in the sub period as well as PlantCML and VaaS. I think there’s a really good focus, Vijay, on both gross margin expansion to come with that top line growth as well as continued operating expense management. Well, OpEx is increasing for the firm. That’s largely driven by – it’s not entirely driven by acquisitions. But on the base business we continue to drive consistent efficiencies. So as I mentioned, I think demand in the state and local business, regionally what’s driving it, Vijay, is the Americas and EMEA. If I just aggregate it from a product view, Land Mobile Radio demand remains pretty solid for North America both in public safety as well as commercial customers and command center software continues to grow at double digits. I think people – we have low penetration, single digit penetration against the $5 billion addressable market. More and more people want to buy this suite of product that we’re developing, so demand is solid there and again, Avigilon, as Jack mentioned. And not only is it a good segment – look, video is in high demand. Everybody knows that both from a city or public safety standpoint as well as commercial. But it’s not just video. It’s video with machine learning, the appropriate analytics, the intelligence in the edge device, integrating it back into VMS and integrating it through our portfolio in the command center and what we do. So the good news is yes, we’re in video but I think our solution is particularly strong around its design of AI at the edge device and the way that we’re incorporating that back from an integration standpoint for our customers in the command center software. So that’s what I’d say. Thank you. Thanks, Vijay. We’ll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead. Thanks. Hi, Greg, there’s been a ton of noise since the last call about Chinese manufacturer I think even today. There was another one ripped out of a Nokia network. I’m just curious. As you’re kind of ramping the Avigilon business and talking to customers, is that something that’s resonating with enterprise customers as well as public safety and how do you think that plays out? Because I think there’s been some press about not only the manufacturers of some of these cameras being Chinese but even the components of other cameras that you wouldn’t necessarily think are Chinese maybe creating some concern for customers that could be an opportunity for you guys? No, I think you’re right, Walt. As you know, right, to back up, there’s obviously a growing concern about what I call Chinese electronics content through the lens of cellular, Hawaii, ZTE; through the lens of Land Mobile Radio, Hytera; and certainly in video concerns around Hikvision and Dahua and I mentioned them by name because they’re mentioned by name in the National Defense Authorization Act. They’re mentioned by name because our government has said that there is concerns around national security as it relates to those vendors. The government’s saying that, we’re not saying that, so we’re following it accordingly. Clearly that’s been official as Molloy and team going to the U.S. federal business. The NDAA takes effect in August of this year. Although since it’s out there with long sales cycles, I think it’s already being contemplated with purchases now even though it hasn’t gone into effect until August 13th. Your other question is right. It’s not just government agencies, it’s critical infrastructure. So whether it’s power grid or airports or transit or oil and gas, I think there is an effect where some customers are contemplating because critical infrastructure looks an awful lot like public safety and it gives some of our customers cause for pause. And your last point is also correct that it’s not just Chinese vendors but there are some critical Chinese components in other people’s product that this ban applies to. So all of that said, I think we continue to drive to be the preferred Western alternative and leader which we are in mission critical communications, command center software in video and all of the characteristics that you described both governmentally and in critical infrastructure, Walt, I think are favorable. And then just my follow-on question since Chris said we do get two. Enterprise, again, I think earlier you had mentioned that Avigilon is strengthening your enterprise sales capabilities. One of the acquisitions you’ve done historically have been adding more things to sell in the public safety and helping those good relationships with the customers. When we look at 2019 and 2020, is there going to be an opportunity to add things that also be – maybe they be enterprise – like I’m thinking like industrial IoT type applications where things that might not necessarily be the stronghold of public safety but it fuel maybe the enterprise base given you’ve got this sales force there now. Yes, I think that’s a possibility, Walt. If you take our VaaS acquisition and license plate recognition, there’s a part of that solution that is public safety centric but there’s also a part of that solution that’s deployed around commercial enterprise. So yes, I think we will look at acquisitions. We’re always evaluating acquisitions that make sense strategically and financially that would supplement the strength in clearly public safety but it may make sense to your point in the enterprise as well. Whether it be IoT or critical infrastructure, we’ll always keep an eye on that for those assets. In the interim, you’re just going to buy kind of stock back. You mentioned 125 so far. That’s obviously – you already hit our Q1 run rate. So in the absence of acquisitions just was share repurchase, right? Again, we’ve always talked about the capital allocation model which on a normalized basis we continue to follow. We used the majority of our capital last year to acquire companies. As we’re into 2019 we will pay back the 400 million or we intend to pay back the 400 million of short-term debt associated with the Avigilon acquisition. When you do that and over the course of the year given more available capital, again, today it contemplates buying maybe approximately 500 million of shares plus or minus which again is fungible between share repurchase and/or acquisition. But you’re right. We’ve gotten off to a solid start in Q1. Great. Thank you. We’ll go next to Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks. Greg, I had a question before the call prepared to ask you about catalysts beyond 8 and 8, but I guess you preempted me on that. So I wanted to ask on the 9 -- I anticipated your question. Yes, you did. So 9 and 10, just wanted to kind of break it apart just starting with the 9 billion in revenue. You’ve seen nice revenue growth for a while. I think that implies like a high single digit revenue growth CAGR to 2021. We’re likely going to get questions on concerns that we’ve been enjoying and upgrade cycle, narrow banding, all that sort of stuff and lapping that. Understand the secular trends in Services and Software, but maybe just talk about what gives you the confidence on the Products and SI side to enable the sort of growth CAGR that you’re applying here? Well, so I think I’d say three things about the 9 and 10. Remember it’s not prescriptive guidance, it’s directional. It’s a current view and it’s contemplated within the capital allocation framework. In other words, it could very well be a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. So if not meant to be and necessarily unpacking some detailed three-year view, but as we’ve looked at it from a management team and incorporated both what’s in backlog and the drivers of the business across the segments for Services and Software as well as Products and SI, again, segment guidance thinking low-single digits P&SI; Software and Services high-single digits we think those respective growth rates are generally sustainable which informs our view of that three-year target. So that’s kind of the way to think about it and contextualize it. Okay, that’s helpful. I think it also implies a strong double-digit profit dollar growth CAGR. Maybe just touch on as you thought about that plan, which segment do you see the most opportunity to expand margins to enable it? Well, in '19 we’re going to expand operating margins for both segments. For Kelly Mark’s group, the Services and Software, we talked about it a year ago and here we are. So we’re guiding to it specifically about gross margins of about 50% and operating margins of about 30%. On the PS&I segment, comparable gross margins of 48% to 49% but operating margin growth of 100 basis points on the bottom line. Over time, I think that Services and Software, given its profile and given its over time expansion in gross margins to be more software and multiyear services like, I think we have an opportunity to grow those margins over time which I think would clearly be beneficial to us. Thanks and congrats and 2018. Thank you. We’ll go next to Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. My question only has to do with just contribution from VaaS and Avigilon. Did they contribute anything to your reported backlog in the quarter or very little for 2018? Well, Avigilon very little; nothing for VaaS. It was subsequent to quarter end. Got it. And then for Avigilon and VaaS as you think about these two businesses being integrated into your business and then offered across I guess you’d say the rest of the channel and the sales force that you have currently, would you describe the integration at least for Avigilon as somewhat completed or still in that cycle? And then for VaaS, could you give us an idea on when that would be considered fully integrated across every single sales person, every entity, et cetera? I would say Avigilon’s integration is largely completed and VaaS again dimensionalized of about 100 million of annual revenue, EPS neutral for '19. It’s a fairly small tuck-in, so I would expect us to have some run rate and rhythm of performance in a quarter or two. Got it. Thank you. We’ll go next to Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. I know you earlier talked about the federal government closure. The question is, is there any ripple effect positive or negative in kind of state and local governments whether it be election cycles or the federal government shutdowns and coming back or is the contract just so long-term nature they’re not impacted? Yes. As it applies in state and local, around nine years ago start and local government really kind of moved away from federal grants. There’s been kind of a suppressive effect on federal funding to the locals for public safety technology. So they stand alone. They budget their own dollars in a large part. And so the federal shutdown has no impact at all. State and local is fully operational. RFP activity, cutting purchase orders, et cetera, is normal course of activity right now. And then my follow up is any updates on the Airwave terms extensions, is it reflected in your backlog? How should we think about that if any changes? Thrilled about the Airwave extension. I tip my hat to Kelly Mark and Vincent Kennedy and his whole team is securing that extension again through the end of 2022. It’s about 1.1 billion that went into backlog and we expect another 300 million to 350 million of additional contracts, local entities that aggregate up that will go into backlog that those contracts get signed between now and the end of the year so that the 1.45 billion which was referenced by the customer is fully contracted for entering into the extension period. It is worth noting to your point that the terms and conditions are substantially similar to the original contract term for Airwave which I think is obviously good and a lot of hard work by a lot of people. So it’s good news. Jim, just to be clear on the 1.1 billion into backlog. So as we think about year-over-year backlog increase in Services and Software, 1.1 billion was the Airwave extension, but in the backlog – the year ending backlog you have to offset the revenue that we realized in 2018 as well as a portion of the FX that we noted in our earlier comments, impact to backlog. So when you think about the Services and Software segment, the majority of the backlog increase was driven by the Americas, by North America. It’s about $550 million or so of backlog increase associated with Airwave just to be clear on that. It’s a great point, Gino. Thanks very much for the details and clarifications. That’s great. I appreciate it. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our next question from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks, guys. First off, I was hoping Greg or Gino I think you all had referenced Avigilon the quarter before last as having accelerated from the 15% growth rate at the time of the acquisition earlier last year. I was hoping you can give us an update on where that growth rate is today? I heard you say that you’re expecting 15% or triple the 5% market rate, but again if you could update that. The bigger picture question is relative to the guidance you gave for calendar '19, where are the greatest opportunities for upside? Where are the greatest risks for the guidance provided? And one more, if I may, which is I heard you’re response to the last question about state and local. My specific question would be in their budgeting process sort of in the year and I recognize that public safety is somewhat unique, but do you already have visibility in most cases into those budgets? I assume they’re relatively healthy given the state of economy. But that’s the question. Do you already have that visibility? Thanks, guys. So I would say on Avigilon, again, credit to Jack Molloy and his team performed at or ahead of expectations for the planned period last year in '18, healthy double-digit growth. You’re right, again, articulating for '19 looking to 3x the market given the performance of and actions that Jack and team have taken to prepare us to go get and satisfy demand on the commercial as well as public safety side and U.S. federal side. Longer sales cycle, Jack mentioned, he sees that getting more traction in second half. So Avigilon tracking well. On risks and upside, I would just say I think all-in, I think our view is balanced. It’s probably worth noting that if I were to detail regional color, we see the growth being driven largely by North America or the Americas and EMEA, but we have a muted expectation for Asia-Pac or roughly flat. So I think that incorporates our realistic view at this point of that region. But I’d say from a risk and opportunities standpoint, all-in, it’s a balanced view at this point in time. And, Paul, I think you last question was around state and local budgets and to answer your question, our team works very closely on both fronts. There’s operational budgets for state local governments and that would really encumber maintenance and support of networks. The secondary thing that’s also device refreshes and those kind of things. So we have good visibility on a consistent basis to those budgets. The second thing is our team particularly here in North America, Jim Mears' team works very closely with customers on large scale projects in terms of capital allocation request that we put through. So in terms of visibility I think our team around the room here is generally pleased. The sixth quarter rolling that we take, we obviously take a keen interest on not only what’s happening this quarter but on six quarters and visibility and pipeline for state and local government continues to look good. I appreciate it. Thank you. We’ll go next to Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Greg, can you provide a little bit color on the VaaS acquisition, perhaps dimensionalize the strategy behind the acquisition and perhaps the growth rate and where you expect synergies and the benefit going forward with that acquisition? Well, I think the VaaS acquisition is all about the importance of content. And it has the largest data base of license plates in North America. It’s a critical need component for public safety. And we have been talking to these folks for a number of months and feel it’s a natural tuck-in that matches the demand requirements of our customers. It improves our analytics capability. I think it integrates and simplifies our customers’ workflows. So I just think it makes a lot of sense. As we mentioned, it’s probably an additional – approximately 100 million in revenue in 2019, EPS neutral for the year, probably $0.01 negative in Q1 if you really want to disaggregate and get into the detail. But I like it because data is getting more and more important and this specific data is directly a high need one for our public safety North American customers. Got it. Do they go to market the same way as Motorola does? There will be synergies in the sales force? We look to line up – this is Kelly, Keith. We look to line up their sales team working with our team closely. They also use some partners. So there are similarities to the way we go to the market. And in regards to selling their solution, it will fit right into our command center software selling motions that happen with Jack’s team. Great. And then just a follow-up question here. As mentioned, you want to be able to grow gross margins throughout the year. I guess if you could just fill us in on a little bit of strategy how you’re going to do that? Is there efficiencies in getting a manufacturing process or through pricing? How do you plan on raising gross margins? In both segments, either segment, Keith? Both segments. Okay. So let’s take the Services and Software segment first. A large part of the margin expansion in 2018 and a significant portion moving forward into 2019 is related to our underlying software business and improvements we’ve made in delivering, closing out prior projects. In the government sector – I’m sorry, in the Products and Systems Integration segment gross margin improvements, there’s several initiatives around gross margin from SKU reductions to rationalizations in the supply chain as well as some targeted price actions within that segment. And I think for both segments, Andrew Sinclair on the software side and Jack’s team with [indiscernible] and Scott Mottonen I think that we continue to get efficiencies around platforming of these businesses, both platforming infrastructure, platforming LMR devices and platforming command center software. And those efficiencies are reflected in the gross margin expansion for Services and Software and some of the operating margin expansion planned for PS&I. Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Good luck. Thank you. We’ll go next to Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. I’m wondering if you could give us a little bit of help on projecting out the segment level revenue for 2019. I’ve seen obviously the baskets loaded into the Software and Services business. Perhaps you can sort of elaborate a little bit for us. Sure. Paul, this is Gino. Really it’s consistent with what we’ve said about the longer term guidance; Products and Systems Integration at low-single digit growth and Services and Software at high-single digit growth. Now that’s a longer-term view but in general that’s our view of the growth of both segments. Okay. Thank you. And then if I may ask the Airwave questions a slightly different way. I think in the past we’ve thought of it as a $400 million to $500 million revenue per annum contract and I wasn’t quite sure with the 1.1 billion whether we should cut that back a little bit or was there some kind of adjustments that we had to make based upon what Greg was saying earlier on that gets us back into that $400 million to $500 million zone, or perhaps I was just simply wrong? No, the total number associated with the Airwave extension is 1.45 billion. 1.1 billion is contracted for already and has fed into backlog. We expect subsequent 300 million to 350 million in local contracts executed over the balance – over the next several months. So the Airwave extension three years through the end of 2022, Paul, is that’s a very substantially similar terms on the original deal. So that’s a favorable outcome for us. Yes, got it. Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dive in a little bit on the command center. How would you say you’re progressing on the creation of a broader products suite and can you talk a little bit about the sales cycle of that motion in customers? What’s the duration? How does it compare to what you’ve seen traditionally in LMR? How does it compare to Avigilon? Thanks. So on the command center, the progress – we’re very pleased with the progress we’re making. The focus of the strategy in the command center has been around three things. First off, it’s around consolidating the platforms across the various product suites that touch every component of the workflow. The second component is around integrating the suites so that there’s a clear flow of information, a common user interface, pieces of records that come in from the 911 call taker will then automatically be handed to the CAD operator and then automatically handed to the command center and then subsequently into records. And the third thing is moving the platform to be cloud ready on the user platform so it’s prepared to be sold as a service. So we’re very pleased at what we’re seeing. As we sell the command center software, I’ll let Jack talk a little bit about the sales cycle. But when we sell brand new software engagements right now, roughly you can think about 25% of those are suite sales. But that’s not the thing that we are really looking at. When we engage our customers, most of our customers that we engage have a piece of software in the command center already. And the elegance of the suite is it makes the subsequent piece as a software that we sell in there all the more attractive based on the common user interface and the interface of data that helps make their workflow operate much, much smoother and hence provides them to be able to provide better outcomes to their customers. So, Jack, I don’t know if you want to talk a little bit about the sales cycle that we see as we engage. Sure, Kelly. So I would just piggyback on that to say that the selling motion is typical of a government CapEx project, typically 12 to 24 months. The difference with command center software and Kelly just noted it is there’s a level of tangibility because it’s a constant. It’s a 24/7 environment whereby they are dealing with the technology. Why this suite approach makes sense from our customers’ standpoint? This is big. It’s because when you go in and do an upgrade of these networks, it’s pretty intensive in terms of the work that’s done. It’s disruptive in the 24/7 environment. So the more than you can get to a common user experience, which is exactly what Kelly and Andrew and team are doing, we think it will make the lives of frankly our dispatchers and 911 call takers much more simple. But again tying it back, similar to a large scale radio network, 12 to 24 months is the sales cycle and we’re engaged now on 2019, '20 and beyond projects. And there are no further questions at this time. I’d like to return the floor back to Mr. Chris Kutsor. Thank you, operator. That will conclude it for today. Thanks everybody. Thank you. This will conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the 2019 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services and Software. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent start to what I believe will be another strong year with first quarter records for sales, operating earnings and ending backlog. Revenue grew 13%. Earnings per share grew 16%, and we generated operating cash flow of $251 million.
I'm pleased – secondly, I'm pleased with our results in Product and Systems Integration and Services and Software. We reported double-digit growth in both segments driven by the Americas and EMEA. At the same time, we did grow backlog year-over-year by almost $800 million. And finally, demand remained strong across our platforms in LMR communications, command center software in video security and analytics. And we continue to invest in our unique mission-critical ecosystem that we're building for long-term growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino. He'll provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q1 revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% versus last year, including $137 million of revenue from acquisitions and $38 million of currency headwinds. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions, was up 4%. GAAP operating earnings were $229 million, up $58 million. And operating margins were 13.8% of sales compared to 11.6% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $315 million, up $55 million or 21%. And operating margins were 19% of sales compared to $17.7 million of sales in the year ago quarter, higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share was $0.86 compared to $0.69 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.28, up 16% from $1.10 last year. OpEx in Q1 was $466 million, up $50 million due to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $36 million compared to $27 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by an increase in net interest expense of $9 million. The Q1 effective tax rate was 20% compared to 19% last year.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $251 million, and free cash flow was $185 million. Operating cash flow was higher by $751 million, and free cash flow was higher by $726 million compared to the prior year. The year-ago quarter included a $500 million voluntary pension contribution. Excluding the pension contribution, Q1 operating cash flow was up $251 million on timing of annual incentive payments, improved working capital and higher earnings.
Capital expenditures were $66 million, up $25 million compared to last year primarily related to Airwave and ESN network investments as well as Avigilon. Capital allocation for Q1 included acquisitions of $445 million of cash and equity for VaaS International Holdings and $136 million in cash for Avtec; $145 million of share repurchases at an average price of $118.98, largely offsetting the dilution associated with the VaaS acquisition; $93 million in cash dividends; and $66 million of CapEx.
Moving to segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.1 billion, up 12% driven by the Americas and EMEA. Revenue growth from acquisitions in the quarter was $75 million. Q1 Products and SI segment operating earnings were $147 million or 14% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year on higher sales and gross margin partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. Notable Q1 wins in the Products and Systems Integration segment include a statewide P25 radio system for the state of North Dakota, a $25 million P25 win with the New South Wales Telco Authority and an $8 million TETRA order from a utility customer in Chile.
Moving to the Services and Software segment. Q1 Services and Software revenue was $588 million, up $72 million or 14% from last year driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue growth from acquisitions in the quarter was $62 million and currency headwinds were $21 million. Services and Software operating income was $168 million or 29% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
Some notable Q1 highlights in the Services and Software segment include a $17 million managed Services contract with a mining customer in Latin America, a $7 million computer-aided dispatch and records contract for a large government customer in California, a $5 million order for video services renewal with the city of Chicago Office of Emergency Management. Looking at regional results. Americas Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 17% on grow in both segments. EMEA Q1 revenue was $363 million, up 7% and also driven by growth in both segments. And in Asia-Pac, Q1 revenue was $129 million, down 5% or $6 million due to currency headwinds and continued expected declines in China.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.4 billion, up $781 million or 8% compared to last year, inclusive of a $222 million unfavorable change in currency rates. Services and Software backlog was up $885 million or 14% compared to last year, driven by EMEA and the Americas. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog was down $25 million due to Airwave revenue recognition.
Products and Systems Integration backlog was down $104 million or 3% compared to last year due to several large system deployments during the past year in the Middle East and Africa. The Americas backlog was up $31 million year-over-year. Sequentially and similar to last year, Products and Systems Integration backlog was down $185 million, on typical North America seasonality.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 4% to 5% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.55 and $1.60. This assumes $35 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares and an effective tax rate approximately 24%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of 6% to 7% with non-GAAP EPS now to be between $7.60 and $7.72. Full year operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. The full year outlook assumes approximately $90 million of FX headwinds at current rates, up from approximately $65 million of headwinds in our prior outlook; approximately $250 million of revenue from acquisitions; and effective tax rate of between 24% and 25%; and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Gino, and let me just close briefly with a few thoughts. First, our Q1 performance positions us for another year of growth coming off a record 2018. Second, we continue to invest in our unique mission-critical ecosystem by expanding our LMR, command center software and video security and analytics platforms. And I expect Services and Software to comprise about 1/3 of our full year 2019 revenue, up from approximately 31% last year.
And finally, for the full year 2019, I continue to expect us to deliver higher gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. And as these durable cash flows grow, you should expect continued discipline and rigor around capital allocation for long-term shareholder value.
And I'll now turn the call over to Chris. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.
Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Please go ahead. Thanks. Just want to focus on product systems integration. The growth rate, 12%. Correct me if I'm wrong because I may have misremembered this, but wasn't there – was it in the last quarter or the March quarter of 2018 didn't have some larger than expected revenue? I think it was Q1 and Q2, so is it fairly difficult comp to put that growth rate on? And if so, what does that mean as we kind of head into Q2 and Q3? Is there something you're able to maintain? Or is there also similarly some kind of onetime or just particularly large contracts that end up getting realized in the quarter? Thanks. Yes. Walt, this is Gino. You do remember correctly, Q1 last year, it include a large order, a large revenue from a California customer. If you look at Q1 for PS&I and look at it on an organic constancy currency basis, it's approximately 6% in the quarter. Our expectation for the full year has not changed. We talked about constant currency growth for the full year at approximately 4%. And we talked about the year shaping up similarly to last year, and that's what we're seeing so far. So for the first half, probably a little closer to 5%, full year at approximately 4%. Really, what drove Q1 were a couple of orders in the Fed – in our Fed division. And that's really what drove the overperformance, about a 6% organic constant currency growth rate. Right. Sorry, I meant the 6% and just 12% obviously has some of the acquisitions. Okay. And then on... Well, I'm sorry, just one more thing. It's important to note that Q1 is our smallest quarter in the year when you look at a seasonality perspective. Q1 is the smallest quarter. Q2 and Q3 are comparable, and Q4 is the largest quarter. So that 6% is coming off of a smaller number in Q1. Got it. I just thought it would have because of the difficult comp, maybe started – it would have been flip-flopped from what you said and maybe start a little tougher in the first half and then strengthen from there. But I guess we'll see how the year progresses. My follow-up is for Avigilon, obviously, continuing a lot of press in terms of the amount of the focus on Huawei and how their components are in competitors' cameras. Just curious on has that resonated? Has that started to resonate with customers in that segment? Do you see any actual pickup in whether it's interest or actually order flow as a result of customers rejecting some of your competitors because of the components that they have in there from Huawei? Thank you. Yes. Walt, I think it has resonated with some of our customers. And as you know, the concern about Huawei and more specifically, Hikvision and Dahua in the video surveillance space, which is in the National Defense Authorization Act. Obviously, it's a concern with the federal government because they're prohibited – any federal agency is prohibited from procuring vendor equipment by that brand. Specifically from a component standpoint, you're right.
Huawei has a silicon chip that is in also in a number of our competitors. But if you look at the federal government and then critical infrastructure, which has many of the same attributes, yes, I think it is a growing concern. I think the NDAA takes effect in August of this year, but it's clearly favorable in terms of what we're doing with Avigilon. Avigilon grew – I think it grew well in Q1 ahead of the market. We still expect it to grow at about 15% and with a little bit more traction in fed government, state and local, in the second half. What are these companies doing on the sales front? Are they pushing back or saying that they're going to rip this componentry out of their products? Or like what's their defense in why a public safety customer would buy their products versus yours? Yes. Walt, a lot of what you've seen with the Huawei, the computer and chips aren't really in public safety. A lot of those are enterprise type customers and there's concerns here, but it's not the same and it's not the same regulations and stipulations as to what they buy as you've seen in the National Defense Authorization Act. So it's a little different approach in the enterprise versus government and critical infrastructure space. Understood. Thank you. The next question will come from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good afternoon guys. Gino, just want to talk about gross profits here. Obviously, a nice step up year-over-year. And according to my back of the NOL calculation, it looks like Services and Software were a big driver of that. Just can you talk about the sustainability of that throughout the year as usually the first quarter of the year is your weakest gross margins? Can we expect that to continue ramping up throughout the year? Walt, I'm sorry, Keith. The – our view hasn't changed for the full year. We talked about margins in the Services and Software segment gross margins approaching 50% and operating margins approaching 30% for the full year. That continues to be our expectation. No change to P&SI as well on margin expectations. We expanded – we expect to expand margins in both segments in 2019. Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, Greg, perhaps a little bit of color on the strategy of making the Avtec acquisition in the quarter? Avtec. Avtec, yes. So the Avtec, we're excited about Avtec. It does two things fundamentally. Number one, it expands the commercial markets we serve. It's a dispatch solution, but it actually extends us into the airport, seaport and rail markets, which are new markets for us, so we're excited there. The second thing is as we looked at our R&D portfolio, where we're planning on next generation dispatch for commercial, there were some economies in terms of bringing the company on, and we like what they're doing from a development standpoint. So very well-run company in the South Carolina. We're excited to have them as part of the family. Great. Thanks. Keith, just to add while we're on the Avtec subject. For the full year, revenue expectation is approximately $20 million. And we expect it to be slightly dilutive for the full year. Sorry. Did you say $20 million or $28 million? Approximately $20 million. Great. Thank you. Your next question will come from Greg Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. This is George. I just wanted to, I guess, dig in on the effort on the command center software business. There's a big initiative I know going on in the company around platforming those products and pushing them onto more of a SaaS model. Can you kind of talk about where you are in that transition and the integration of the different software pieces you have there? And then what kind of milestones do you have in terms of getting into a subscription-type model next year? Thanks. Hey, George, it's Kelly. So we're making great progress on it. We've already launched a number of our products into the cloud or selling them as a service, specifically if you think about Kodiak or VaaS. So we're making good traction on that. We expect the materiality of our portfolio to be cloud-ready by the end of 2020. I will note, though, even though as we move towards cloud, our software products will continue to be available either to our customers on-prem or in the cloud. So that transition will be gated based on our customers' desire and how they want to execute on deployment. But we view it as moving along quite well with the business and the milestones we look for, which you will see in announcements like you saw this past quarter on CommandCentral aware, which is another one of our Products which we recently made available in the cloud. You'll see more of those announcement come between now and the end of 2020 as we make them available in the cloud. Got it. And what's customer receptivity like on that? Do you -- obviously, you're asking people to kind of buy product in a little bit different model there. And again, it's a customer option, but talk about sort of the circumstances under which you see customers kind of consuming that way. And how does that affect the model for you guys going forward? Thanks. It's early days on that as we make it available. And based on the products we have right now, we've had high amount of customer receptivity to that. There are going to certainly be certain issues. We might get into -- for governments related to whether or not they actually can store their data in the cloud, which will be something that we'll look at and watch as we deploy it, but they've been relatively receptive to it. It certainly helps in regards to security and keeping the systems up-to-date and managing uptime versus when you have it and what we call an on-prem deployment. But it's early days in regards to launching that. But initially for the customers who are receptive to that, it's been going quite well. The next question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks. Hi, Greg, Gino. I get ask this question quite a bit from clients, which would be around command center software portfolio. You know you have kind of interesting building blocks called management, command control, records, evidence and on and on. So the question that I get asked and like to get your view is, do you have companies who compete with you across the software command center portfolio architecturally? Or is your competition more under the piecemeal, the individual building blocks? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Sure. Hi, Vijay. We feel very good about the components that we have and the width and breadth of what we've acquired to include, as you referenced, 911 call handling, get dispatch, records and evidence management. And we do not believe that competitively, anyone else has the width and breadth of the suite that we are building. It's a fragmented marketplace. There's different competitors depending upon the element that's being evaluated. But I think Kelly and Andrew Sinclair and team are doing a really good job on building out the suite, cloud-enabling the portfolio and its respective components, increasing SaaS subscriptions and moving away from perpetual license. And I like our competitive position. To the earlier question by George, I think we have high interest. More customers remain interested in buying components of the suite. But given the buying habits of state and local, I think it will be gradual but that's okay. But very much like what Kelly and team are building there. Yes, perfect. A quick follow-on would be for Gino in terms of use of cash and also just the investment strategy in the company, both internal and inorganic. Thanks. Actually, Vijay, let me just jump back. Gino and I work very closely, quite frankly, the whole team on the deployment of capital. I think it's the most important thing we do. As you've seen, we've done a combination of increased organic investment, inorganic acquisitions surgically to build out the command center software suite and video assets that we think are strategic in video security and analytics and also return capital to shareholders.
Love the fact that we did -- we're able to do $145 million of share repurchase in Q1 at $118 a share. Gino has been very consistent in our capital allocation framework 50%, 30%, 20%. 50% to be used for share repurchase for acquisition, 30% dividend and 20% CapEx. Given our performance to-date, we have about $500 million approximately available to us between now and the remainder of the year, which is fungible between either share repurchase or acquisition. We also expect to pay down the short term loan associated for $400 million associated with the Avigilon acquisition we made last year. We expect to complete that by the end of the year. Thank you. Thank you. The next question will come from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks and good evening. I just wanted to start on the 2019 EPS guidance. I know it comes up by a couple of pennies but just beat Q1 by $0.15. You've got tax rate lower, share count higher, but I think the net of it is that your profit dollars assumptions are generally unchanged. So correct me if I'm wrong there. But if so, the business seems to have a lot of momentum. You're talking about strong backlog. I guess, why wouldn't forward quarters be raised a little bit more? Just talk about the thoughts to the guidance build up. So we feel very good about the year, the full year and the remainder of the year. As Gino talked about, we look at the year and our overall performance and focus on organic growth, more specifically organic growth, constant currency. So we did have a strong Q1 driven largely by a couple of orders in Fed. But we're less concerned around the individual linearity within a quarter but stick to the full year.
And we believe with overall backlog up, aged backlog comparable to slightly up for the remainder of the year that our full year guidance on top line remains prudent. I'll also remind you that we have $25 million of incremental FX headwinds from the last time we spoke that's incorporated and contemplated into our full year guidance. When we look at the EPS, it is largely a flow-through associated with the lower tax rate. But there is some, a couple of pennies associated with improved business performance overall. We love the start. We feel comfortable about our expected ability to achieve what we stated and it's performing as expected. But we think the guidance is prudent at this point in time. Got it. That's helpful, Greg. And just as a follow-up, I think to your point, it implies continued year-over-year operating margin expansion. Just hoping that you can maybe just touch on the composition of this? I think previously, you had 100 to 200 basis points from the Product and SI segment. I know that was supposed to be more back-half weighted, but you had 40 basis points year-over-year improvement in Q1. So I'm just trying to determine if maybe the Products and SI margin expansion is down a tick and Services and Software are up a tick? Or are we still 100 to 200 on the Products and SI side? I think the software and Services operating margin is consistent with what we've told you before as is P&SI. Just to put a finer point on it, I think that probably operating margin in the 22% to 23% range for the full year seems to make the most sense at this point in time. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks Greg. You bet. Next question will come from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Thanks. Appreciate you all taking the question. First off, some of your compadres in the com equipment market, albeit focus on the commercial sectors as opposed to public safety, has citied weakness in Germany and the UK and cited Brexit and cited a big downturn in the automotive industrial sector in Germany. Again, I recognize 80% of the revenue comes from pubic safety, but do you see any of that weakness? Is there any impact or visibility? And then I've got a follow-up question. Hey Paul, it's Jack. So with regards to -- obviously, we've seen some slowdown on the commercial side in Europe. But I would caveat and I think it's important to note that our European business is largely insulated due to the fact that we're largely a managed service company. If you think about Airwave and the other nationwide networks that we manage, we've got -- the preponderance of our business is recurring revenue in Managed and Support Services in Europe. So we -- as Greg alluded to and Gino in the opening, we had a solid Q1. We expect comparable growth to 2018 in Europe, Middle East and Africa this year. All right. And then if I can ask on the Avigilon piece, you had that earlier to announcement about the integrations with command and control software platform. It sounds like it's on schedule relative to when you did the deal back in early 2018. So that takes you to the public safety market. I assume that with the big firing gun in terms of entering the public safety, Avigilon, if I recall at the time of the deal, was just the commercial sector they had their hands full and trying to address the public safety market.
Greg and Gino, did that not translate to an acceleration of the revenue growth from video analytics and surveillance and the associated hardware? If I recall at the time of the deal, I think they were doing mid-teens growth. The first quarter out, you referenced acceleration. I haven't heard that reference again since, in their fourth quarter since the deal. But now that you're taking some public safety market, I would think there will be strong receptivity and that would actually accelerate the growth of that still relatively small base. Yes. I think the gating factor or in terms of going after public safety and state and local is more about channel and sales cycle. Remember, Avigilon was a commercial enterprise video company, which was great and they've done a great job. But Molloy has done a very good job of redirecting investment, mainly sales coverage and heads and the channel program to redirect it to be more public safety. So I don't think it was a product interoperability issue with command center software.
I think it's channel investment that takes time. And I think it's sales cycle on competitive RFPs that take time. We still expect strong growth to your overall point, which is why we stated upfront that we think Avigilon can grow 3x the market at about 15%. So we do expect to get more traction. But at this point, we think on a larger basis, it's prudent to leave that guidance consistently at about that level. But good progress. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Thank you. And I have a question for Greg kind of bigger picture and then kind of a financial question for -- probably for Gino. But Greg, when you think about and just looking at the overall economy with strong employment, housing prices going higher, should lead to more inflows to government municipalities, police forces and first responders should be using your products. Is it fair to say that these are leading to more healthier discussions today for your new products?
Or is there a little bit of, I want to say diversion of police forces trying to retrain their staff to make sure that they don't end up with a black sore eye from public social media responses. And then for Gino, the question, it looks like while you're raising EPS for the full year, it looks like it's fully accounted for from the lower tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% earlier. So you mentioned you're also increasing your outlook due to organic, but I'm just trying to make sure that I'm not missing something. Or are you investing a little bit more? I'll just answer the second one real quickly just because I mentioned it a few minutes ago. But the tax rate difference or the lower tax rate we think is worth about $0.05 and we raised the high end from $770 to $772. So the EPS guidance raise, you're right, it's because largely of lower tax rate but not solely. There's also some business improvement that comes from that. Just to add to that, Jim, keep in mind the share count change from 175 million to 176 million shares. And as mentioned earlier, the acquisition, the Avtec acquisition is slightly dilutive. As you're going through your math and model, you have to incorporate those as well. And as Greg mentioned earlier, the increase in FX, the $25 million increase in FX from FX headwinds from our prior view. And Jim, as it relates to kind of overall macroeconomics, I think the very good thing about this business among other things is the consistent demand for what we sell. Real strong economy or in a more tepid economy. We see consistent strength in North America. And also strength because the markets, the addressable markets that we're playing in have been expanded. So if you rewind the tape and you know this very well, we were more traditionally a mission-critical radio communications provider. As we continue to invest organically and inorganically, we're doing – we're playing in so many other areas beyond that. We're playing in the command center, software space with the respective components and an addressable market there that's $5 billion to $6 billion.
We're in the video, security and analytics market now with Avigilon, which we think is about $12 billion-plus, completely zeroing out China. And of course, Kelly and team continue to build out the services around that. So I think the strength and the continued performance of what we're doing is because of the width and the breadth of our product portfolio led by a healthy economy in North America but also reflecting at its fundamental base the criticality and consistent demand for land mobile radio. We talked about wins in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Historically, we had the award here in Florida. It's not contracted for yet. Airwave was extended through the end of 2022. But in a variety of different theaters where Molloy and team compete, land mobile radio demand and the criticality of mission-critical communications is pretty consistent. That's what I think is continuing to drive us along with coverage and execution. I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything. Just one other thing, Greg. And I think I picked up on Jim you talked about more training. And with the state of play -- with respect to state municipal funding, how is that money being prioritized. Greg made a key point. And we made inorganic and organic investments around software and video because of this. One of the trends that we're seeing, and we followed this closely with our law enforcement customers , is less people taking the test, which lends itself to increased demand for complementary technologies to give them investigative tools that they wouldn't have.
So ultimately, how do they do more with less? And the simple answer is technology. And yes, as Greg said, it's our continued demand for land mobile radio. But it's also driving and it's going to continue to drive video in command center software opportunities for us. And so that's why some of the kind of investments and bets that we've made over the last course of last three years will really start to come to pass because we have less and less law enforcement officers, they need greater technology to keep the public safe. Thank you for the detail. It's great. I appreciate it. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. I have no additional comments. Thanks, everybody, for your time.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks everybody for joining us today.
Before I get started, I would like to inform you all that due to a death in the family Jack Molloy is unable to join us for the call today. So, obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with Jack and his family this afternoon.
Turning to the call, I will start-off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business, before Gino takes us the results and outlook. First, Q2 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 6%, earnings per share of 16% and expanded operating margins by 240 basis points versus the prior year.
Additionally, we needed the quarter with our highest backlog position ever of 10.9 billion up 1.5 billion year-over-year and up $500 million sequentially.
Second, we continued to execute well in both segments of the business, our product segment grew 4% and expanded operating margins by 50 basis points, while our services and software segment grew 9% and expanded operating margins by 590 basis points. This strong broad based performance shows that our customers continue to value, the public safety, ecosystem, we have built across our platforms, mission critical communications, command center software and video security solutions.
And finally, based on Q2 results and the demand we continue to see across our portfolio, we are raising both revenue and earnings per share estimates for the full year.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Gino provide additional details on Q2 and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg.
Q2 includes revenue of $1.9 billion up 6% versus last year including $33 million of revenue from acquisitions offset by $37 million of currency headwinds.
Organic revenue growth was 4%. GAAP operating earnings of $349 million up $76 million and operating margins of 18.8% of sales compared to 15.5% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $444 million up $66 million or 17% and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.9% of sales up 240 basis points from 21.5% driven by higher sales and gross margin partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.18 compared to $1.05 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 up 16% from $1.46 last year. OpEx in Q2 was $494 million up $31 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million compared to $44 million in the year ago quarter driven primarily by increases in foreign currency and non-operating expenses. The Q2 effective tax rate was 24% compared to 25% last year.
Turning the cash flow, Q2 operating cash flow was $251 million compared with $425 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $188 million compared to $384 million in the prior year driven by the timing of incentive payments and cash taxes. For the first half of 2019, excluding the voluntary $500 million pension contribution made in 2018, operating cash flow was up $77 million and free cash flow was up $30 million driven by higher earnings.
Capital allocation for Q2 included $94 million in cash dividends, $63 million of CapEx and $25 million of share repurchases at an average price of $146.65. Additionally, we issued $650 million of new 10-year senior unsecured notes and use the proceeds to repurchase existing notes resulting in an extended weighted average debt maturity profile. And subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired WatchGuard, a leader in-car and body-worn video for public safety for total consideration of $271 million.
Moving to segment results, Q2 products and systems integration sales were $1.2 billion up $49 million or 4% driven by the Americas. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million offset by currency headwinds of $18 million. Operating earnings were $242 million or 19.5% of sales up 50 basis points from last year on higher sales and gross margin partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions and investments in our video security solutions portfolio.
Notable Q2 wins in the segment include $60 million of additional P25 orders for the statewide system in North Dakota, a $46 million P25 order from Oakland County Michigan, a $34 million P25 order from Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, $5 million of public safety video security contracts in Broward County, Florida and the Cleveland Metro area and several multimillion dollar video security wins in the education vertical.
Moving to services and software, revenue was $622 million up $51 million or 9% from last year driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $17 million offset by currency headwinds of $19 million. Operating earnings were $202 million or 32.5% of sales up 590 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, gross margin expansion and OpEx reduction.
Some notable Q2 wins in the segment included $200 million ESN extension through 2024, a $60 million P25 multi-year services agreement with the state of Tennessee extending service through 2028, a $59 million five-year contract extension to provide license plate data and analytical software and a $5 million records management contract for Baltimore County.
Looking at regional results, America's Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion up 11% driven by broad base growth across all platforms. EMEA Q2 revenue was $356 million down 7% due to two large system deployments in the Middle East and Africa in the prior year and currency headwinds partially offset by growth in Europe. And in Asia Pac, Q2 revenue was $157 million down 7% or $12 million due to currency headwinds in China.
Moving to backlog, ending backlog was $10.9 billion up $1.5 billion or 16% compared to last year inclusive of $119 million unfavorable change in currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $492 million with growth in both segments. Services and software backlog was up $1.5 billion or 24% compared to last year driven by EMEA and the Americas sequentially backlog was up $430 million due to multi-year contracts in the Americas and the ESN extension.
Products and SI segment backlog was down $48 million or 2% compared to last year primarily due to large system deployments during the prior year in the Middle East and Africa partially offset by $165 million of growth in the Americas. Sequentially, backlog was up $62 million driven by the Americas.
Turning to our outlook, we expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 6.5% with non-GAAP EPS between the $1.91 and $1.96. This assumes 20 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25% versus 18% in the prior year.
For full year 2019, we now expect revenue growth of 7 to 7.5% up from our prior guidance of 6% to 7% and we now expect non-GAAP EPS between $7.67 and $7.77 up from our prior guidance of $7.60 to $7.72. This full year outlook assumes 115 million of FX headwinds at current rates, an increase of $25 million from our prior outlook, $40 million from the acquisition of WatchGuard, an effective tax rate of 24% to 25% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. Full year operating cash flows is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with a few thoughts.
First, Q2 was outstanding. We had strong organic revenue growth in both segments significantly expanded both gross margins and operating margins and ended the quarter with our highest backlog position ever.
Second, the acquisitions we've made in video security and command center software are having a meaningful impact on our business. With our recent purchase of WatchGuard, we've now made acquisitions in these two areas that total $2.4 billion. These acquisitions are expected to contribute revenue of about $1 billion this year growing high teens with an EBITDA profile of about 20% and growing.
And finally, as I look to the second half of this year, I'm encouraged by our performance led by North America, which saw strong organic growth in both segments during the quarter.
LMR demand remains robust and our video security and command center software solutions continue to gain momentum which positions us well for expanded free cash flow generation going forward.
I now would like to turn the call back over to Tim. Thanks Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from George Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to start off by asking about the backlog obviously a nice sequential jump here at $10.9 billion. Can you kind of walk us through the different puts and takes on that backlog that you gave us? I think some parts of it when you're talking about the segments, but I guess I'm trying to drill down into the organic backlog growth and insights into the puts and takes would be great. Sure, George. This is Gino. So, if let's talk year-over-year first for services and software up $1.5 billion. The way to think about that is about two-thirds of that is the U.K. Home Office extensions that we talked about. And a third of it are North America multi-year service contracts. For products and systems integration year-over-year down on projects in the Middle East and Africa and up in the Americas. And sequentially is the $500 million of growth is driven primarily by North America multiyear contracts as well as the $200 million ESN contract extension. Got it. And then, what was the organic growth look like. And backlog it sounds like a whole lot of this is organic. If you could just clarify that, that would be great? Yes. It's primarily organic, primarily all organic. Okay. And then, I guess the topic [indiscernible] China trade wars obviously there is a new salvo here in terms of tariffs that would get implemented on the next tranche of goods. But, I guess I was just wondering what the bigger picture is now with -- you're competing with Hytera and Hikvision on a couple of different sides of the business. Give us your sense for what's going on there and how you're taking advantage of that competitively? Well, I mean contextually George as the tariff trade war continues with China including the tariffs increase that Trump announced a few hours ago that is contemplated in the guidance we're giving for the full year. For the second half roughly it's about an incremental 8 million or 9 million for the full year. Actually it's 8 million or 9 million for the full year and roughly half of that for the second half. But that increase that he talked about being implemented September 1 is already contemplated.
I remind you that we've made decisions going back several years ago where we don't -- we no longer do manufacturing in China. I think Mainland China revenue was about 1.5% to 1.7% of our revenue. So, we don't have a concentration there. We don't do product management. We don't do software development. So I think we're pretty well insulated from some of the things that are going on there, competitively it's an advantage in two different areas. If I take Hytera first and the litigation as you know we won the patent infringement case in DC with the International Trade Commission that implemented an import ban and a cease and desist order. We've had 2 wins in Germany in Mannheim and Düsseldorf. There is a trial going on as we speak in Australia for patent infringement and source code copying and we're optimistic about the outcome. And then, the big one is Chicago in November in 2019. And despite repeated attempts by Hytera to delay and deflect multiple efforts to push that trial into 2020, we have every reason to believe that it will happen in November in Chicago with a jury trial that will evaluate a trade secret theft and source code copying and I and we are looking forward to that trial and subsequently that outcome.
On the Hikvision and Dahua, a video security space as it relates to the NDAA, the procurement ban goes into effect in 13 days on August 13. By the way, Avigilon in the video business performed well in Q2, it grew double digits. It's tracking where we expected to be. Video security we think will be about 15% for the full year, which is 3x the market growth which we articulated before. And interestingly enough those results actually don't really include anything from the federal market. We haven't gained traction yet, the sales cycle in Fed is even longer than state and local.
But, to your point George, I think we will become a beneficiary of the NDAA procurement ban for Hikvision and Dahua in the video security space. But, I think that will be more likely 2020. We are encouraged by the ongoing discussions we have with our Fed customers and I think that will be beneficial in 2020. Thank you. You bet. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start with WatchGuard and maybe touching on the strategic vision with that asset. I'd imagine there is some synergies with other acquisitions that you've done like VaaS. And in that light, I understand the majority of mix for that business is related to in-car video systems based on the S1 they filed a couple years ago. But they also have a body-worn camera business and wanting to understand that that piece is something you think is worth investing in and how you approach that market? Thanks Adam. We're excited about WatchGuard, to dimensionalize it, it is the in-car camera market leader, which fills in a gap that we had within the video solutions portfolio. Secondarily, we are seeing and Molloy is seeing more customers that are buying in-car and body-worn together, which we think is obviously a positive outcome and gives us some optimism for that asset going forward.
On the revenue side, we believe WatchGuard will contribute about $40 million in 2019. But what I love about it is, it's all a similar sales motion. So, it's another key asset in video surveillance and analytics that gets put into the sales force, North America strong 500 plus people that we think we can grow it substantially.
I mean WatchGuard very good company, but they have 35 salespeople half of which are inside salespeople. So, we will by definition give them significant more market reach, touch points with all of the customers that we have bring them into conversations where we have incumbency in land mobile, radio and command center software. We think it's very strategic, I'm excited about it.
And on the body-worn side to your point, we have a body-worn platform they do to, we'll look to rationalize that together and as I mentioned over time sell them in tandem to match more and more the way our customers are buying. Okay. Thanks. And maybe this is a quick follow-up, services and software margins were certainly a highlight in the quarter, significant improvement both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. You could just maybe double-click on the drivers. How much was greater mix of command center, was it operational improvements in core services and the sustainability of that. Thank you. Yes. I will start and maybe Kelly will jump in. But, I think the strong performance was a combination of top-line growth and operating expense efficiencies. I mean it was a fantastic quarter by Kelly and his team and Andrew Sinclair on the software side all the people working services very, very pleased. We had talked about an operating margin for that segment for this year moving toward 30%. If we look at that segment of services and software for the first half, the operating margin is about 30.5%, we now believe given that first half performance that the full year operating margin will look more like 30% to 31% on the operating margin side. So it's just good work by Kelly and his team. That's helpful. Thank you. You bet. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good morning guys. Greg just going back to that tariff real-quick, from a competitive vantage standpoint, there should be some advantage and you guys have versus your Chinese-based competitors especially in the PCR market, correct? And then, how do you guys extrapolate on that? Well, look I think -- generally you're right Keith, it is an advantage. There's more and more developed countries that are very sensitive to putting Chinese gear or Chinese electronics or wireless technology into either critical infrastructure. Obviously, they don't even consider that here in the States. So, from a market standpoint that's an advantage. It's an advantage for us as we go head-to-head against Hytera in the litigation. By the way that was self-inflicted by them.
So when a company steals intellectual property for us that puts so much R&D in patent protection and investment around innovation. We're going to fight appropriately. We want to compete. We like a level playing field, but what they've done is egregious systematic multi-year and I think and we think that there will be a penalty and a payment for them as a result of their actions.
And on the video side, of course, you're right as well that two of the largest video providers being Hikvision and Dahua. And of course, we have to remember that Huawei as a high silicon division that provides a semiconductor that guide some of the intelligence in OEM and white label cameras as well. And that's a benefit too.
So generally, net-net, I think we're a bit unique in that the Chinese situation in total is more tailwind than headwind for our company for a whole host of reasons. Got you. And the, my follow-up, I would be remiss if I didn't ask about FirstNet, obviously, AT&T has been top of the charts in terms of the new additions they have, but what are you seeing in terms of benefit -- your benefit from it, and are people transitioning over to push to talk. They're not. We don't see really any benefit at all in terms of revenue contribution for us. We didn't have really any in Q1; we didn't have any in Q2. And for the full year, Keith, we're really projecting low single digit millions, very, very little. Obviously, AT&T will continue to build out the network, they're adding ""Connections or subscribers"". It's a cellular data play and they will look to win back customers from Verizon or T-Mobile or Sprint onto the FirstNet data plans that is separate than LMR, it's incremental to LMR. Obviously, as we've seen given the organic strength of land mobile, radio here in the States.
And we would know if the users were incremental push to talk over cellular because FirstNet is using Kodiak for that solution which we own as an asset. And when we look at the traction in the growth there, we really don't see it. So, FirstNet, I think is obviously working for AT&T and I think that's great. But, for us it has no meaningful revenue contribution at all this year. Is there expectation you have, the next year or the following year? I think too early to project for next year. But from my view expectations are pretty muted. Got it. Thank you. You bet. Our next question comes from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Greg, I'd like to pursue that just a little bit further, which is to say that, AT&T is seeing several hundred thousand subscribers so far on FirstNet which is a drop in the ocean I know. But, some of the device companies are getting very excited about the opportunity. And I guess the question, it's a two-part question. One is, what is your plan in terms of deploying devices on to FirstNet, how does Motorola making money out of the device side of the story.
And the second is, do you see any competition here for [indiscernible] budgets inside the first responder community. And is that part of the reason, the many interesting initiatives you're doing in that context. Well, I will the answer the second one first. We see budgets being pretty healthy here in U.S. state and local. That combined with the criticality of what we sell into public safety on mission critical communication platforms as well as command center software and video security makes what we sell more of a must have than a need to have.
On the device side, Paul, we already have a device approved on the FirstNet procurement list. So, we have the LEX product that's approved. I think it's fair to say that you'll see us have some additional new products over time. But, today first responders have that land mobile, radio P25 here in the U.S. and a smartphone. And if there's an additional device if you will that device -- it will replace the smartphone, which we don't have any market share to begin with any way.
So, device while I said earlier is pretty much zero for us to date. There's really nothing but upside because if there is some kind of device that may get traction on FirstNet from a data side, it would be a smartphone enhancement or a smartphone like replacement and won't affect the mission critical typically APX P25 radio. And then, they look to this FirstNet network sort of roll into the 5G plans as well that likewise you don't see as either a revenue opportunity nor a risk? I don't see it as a risk. I do see it as a revenue upside. It's additional to LMR. It is really outside of LMR. The fatter the pipe and the faster the speed, I think those are positive conditions for what we sell in command center software and video security. So, as the pipe gets fatter as that cellular network gets built out as 4G over several years migrates to 5G. It has no impact that we could see on LMR, an upside is what we see on the other two platforms we're building. Got it. Thank you. Thanks Paul. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Hi. This is Josh Kehoe behalf of Jim Suva. Thanks for taking our question. Could you give us any more color on how you're sizing up the potential opportunity for Avigilon from the National Defense Authorization Act? Geographically, we'd expect to see the most benefit and how you think of the potential ramp in revenues today? Well, I would say, first of all, just to dimensionalize Avigilon, solid double-digit growth in Q2. Number two, still expect about 15% revenue growth this year, which we think is 3x of the market. Love the state and local government wins in Q2. Both the Cleveland area and Broward County are new and material as it relates to Avigilon.
And Safe Schools, on the enterprise and education front is white hot for reasons that we all know safer schools, securing the perimeter, protecting school children, having a necessary lock down and doing the kinds of things around perimeter security, video surveillance, anomaly detection, motion detection and having those alerts without human intervention, feed into appropriate law enforcement officials in a 911 center automatically. And then, also signal alerts to the land mobile radio to the principal or security person or guidance counselor are critical. That use case is widespread. Getting traction and significant.
So I love what Molloy has done by the way, he and his team have made investments on the product side. I think you'll see some new cameras roll out in the second half of the year. We've significantly increased go-to-market which is part of the reason that informs our confidence and our ability to perform the way we described in this critical area.
And all this is really without any contribution to your point Josh from the NDAA yet the sales cycle and Fed are longer. The conversations are great, we're having active dialogue. As you've probably seen and understand the procurement prohibition of Chinese video providers takes effect in 13 days and our customers are struggling to identify and replace our Fed customers given the resources that they have we are helping them where we can. But we expect that to get traction more in 2020 than this year. Okay. Thank you. Thanks josh. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey. I think it's actually Brian Yoon from Deutsche. So I also had a question on the Avigilon business. So on the product refresh opportunity from the National Defense Act what we've been seeing and kind of hearing is, sales confusion, kind of customer confusion on whether it's just limiting new Chinese equipment purchases, or if the requirement is to sort of rip out existing systems, since you guys are super close to the conversation there. Can you kind of expand on what you're seeing what your view is? Do they have to rip out the existing equipment in both cases Avigilon kind of comes out as a clear winner, but it'd be interesting to get your view? Thanks. Brian, there is two dimensions to the National Defense Authorization Act in terms of the federal ban. One is August 13. It's a procurement ban. So, as of the 13th of this month, no federal agency can procure new video security equipment from Hikvision or Dahua. And a year from this month in August of next year is the second leg of it, which is a grant prohibition which is to say that no federal funds can be used for their procurement of Chinese video security mainly those two companies named. So, grant money that might be created at the Fed level that could flow through to a state and local or community cannot be used as of August of next year. They don't necessarily have to rip out the video cameras that they have today. So there's a procurement ban of August of this year. There's a grant ban rather they can't use grant money in August of 2020. Okay, great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Good evening everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on two items if I could. First is, can you talk a little bit more about where public sector customers are deriving the funds and budget dollars across the three major segments, LMR, I think we're pretty familiar with, but when you look at surveillance and command center opportunities for those future win, where does that money come from?
And then, a second kind of follow-on as you leverage yourself into more of these longer tail public safety assets, how does that influence your ability to compete in deals, you feel like you're getting more pricing power. There's no like-for-like competition what are you seeing on that front? Thank you. On the first one, I would just say that U.S. state and local budgets are healthier generally. Obviously some states vary as you know, but I think that tax revenues and overall fiscal conditions from a budget standpoint -- we see healthier than they have been in several years. They source different revenues from different points. Some have obviously 911 taxes that are used to fund the procurement of command centers software and other kinds of things like that. But, the other thing that makes us affordable in the envelope of these budgets is that we're selling these long-term multi-year contracts as an example. Gino is in his commentary talked about the State of Tennessee, which goes through 2028.
So, given -- depending upon the way the customer wants to buy, it could be OpEx, it could be CapEx and depending upon the length of time that they want to pay for it. We have the flexibility to meet them in a way that's conducive for them to buy that fits the affordability envelope of their individual fiscal situation.
But, and the Fed, I would say has been beneficial given the fact that there is budget clarity and certainty. So, specifically for us as it relates to that budget we saw more revenue and deals flow in the first half than the second half because of the budget certainty and the clarity that the Trump administration and obviously Congress has provided. So, I think from a federal budget standpoint today that situation is more favorable than it has been in the past as well. On the competitive landscape, as you get into more of the area surveillance within -- the broader command center envelope. How does that influence your competitive position and deal? I think it's advantage generally speaking. In land mobile radio, I think it's remained the same, but in command center software as we've acquired more assets and can compete on 911 call handling, can compete on Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 CAD, can compete on records management or evidentiary management. And then more importantly, which is in part what's led to the operating margin expansion in Q2 to put these assets together and platform them. So, if a customer wants to buy a point product for one of those areas, we can sell it, if they want the economies of scale of ""Speak Suite"" which is two or more of those. Obviously, that's an advantage that we have given the scale that we provide the integration we're building the cloud enabling, set of architectures that we're putting around command center software where a customer can be on-prem, or hybrid cloud, or in the public cloud and we'll meet them where they want to be met on a common architecture. It's a competitive advantage.
On the video security side, we've got fixed video, we now have in-car video, we have body-worn video and we'll do everything we can from an end-to-end standpoint the package and differentiate and sell it as a compelling value proposition because I think a bigger and more integrated is a competitive advantage for us over time. Thanks, Greg. I appreciate it. Please give Jack a pat. We will do. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you. The first question I had for you was on WatchGuard and how you think about the market that WatchGuard is in and various competitors, the market growth rate? And then, what do you think you'll be able to grow a business like WatchGuard now that it is within Motorola. And I have a follow-up. I think that one of the things we like about WatchGuard is, it's the in-car camera market leader. I think it's -- we don't give individual product or segment guidance per se. But, I think it's reasonable to say that WatchGuard could grow at a double-digit profile given the interest in video, given the way I think customers will buy in the future in combination by buying in-car and body-worn together. They'll do some of those purchases more together. And the overall TAM for video is several billion dollars, a [indiscernible] video and as we've said, Avigilon is 12 billion to 13 billion without China. And then, you add incrementally body-worn video and in-car camera to that TAM total and look at that profile and we believe in general we can grow that double digits. Got it. Thank you. And then, regarding my follow-up question actually has to do with the operating margin in services and software, now you've clearly shown and demonstrated there has been expansion, would you say up to this point that you're achieving services and software operating margin expansion faster than expected. And do you think that that could be the case over the next couple of years as well that you would achieve a higher profile faster given the way your business is tuning up. I think it was achieved in the first half more than we thought than it would be for the full year. So, remember the operating margin target for that segment was 30%. We've inched it up to 30% to 31%. I think you can't necessarily focus on one quarter from a linearity perspective but make no mistake; I'm pleased with the performance of that segment reflected in the increased color of going from 30% to 30% to 31%. I think Kelly and his team are making meaningful changes that will be foundational that will enable us to continue to grow it over time. Too early to forecast obviously anything for next year, but would we and would I expect it to grow. Yes, we would and I would great. Great. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead. Guys I appreciate you taking the question, Greg and Gino, I apologize to you and others if you all have already been asked and answered this question, I've been hopping around from calls tonight, so do apologize. But on the video piece, Avigilon and a number of other acquisitions form a part, if I'm not mistaken it looks like Hikvision and Dahua between two, they do about $1.5 billion of revenue or did $1.5 billion of revenue in their respective fiscal '18 collectively, outside of China, I don't know how much of that was in the U.S. But, if we return back to that opportunity in terms of those two competitors in particular, the number one and three in the market being gated, it is there a way to quantify, I assume the opportunity for you is entirely in the U.S. in terms of the incremental that there's not an impact outside of the U.S. with respect and mitigated, how much revenue is, any sense for how much revenue there is that you could pick up from their particular situation. Well, I think Paul it's reflected in the performance and the guidance we've given i.e., the market. So, take China out, the market without China is growing about 5% or 5.5% in our expectations are 15%. So, by definition we've set in place a plan and a strategy around investment, products, refresh cameras, going down market on certain cameras. And then, as well as channel synergy and go-to-market investment and that is we believe could have a yield of 3x.
Now we talked about this a little bit before Paul, but that's okay, just to quickly dimensionalize it. The performance we have and we expect to have with Avigilon is really without any anticipated significant contribution from Fed and the National Defense Authorization Act both on procurement and grant restrictions. We don't see that having any effect at this point in time for this year. So, if we can grow about 3x the market, without China, investing and refreshing the camera portfolio and cheering it more broadly, bringing on more effective channels, significantly adding go-to-market. And by the way it's more than U.S. and North America. We think it's also EMEA as well.
This market is $12 billion to $13 billion market without China that's growing nicely. So, we are optimistic about what we can do here and it's one of the areas. Again, we're about building platforms, it's not just video, it's the edge device, it's the storage, it's the management, it's the analytics, machine learning and the A.I. that take all of that end-to-end experience and provide use cases around specific verticals to differentiate. This is a hot market, I think Molloy has done a good job. We have a lot more work to do, but that's the perspective. Greg, if I could ask you a quick follow-up to your point about platforms, correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think it was just a quarter ago maybe two quarters ago, when you had completed or at least had integrated the Avigilon and perhaps some of the other video capabilities into your command and control software based platform.
Did you address or could you address what the early indications are in terms of take up by those 6000 command and control centers throughout the U.S.? Hey, Paul. It's Kelly. So, I'll touch on that. When I spoke to that before, it was really in regards to as we bring these platforms together we make sure the inter-linkages between the various components, LMR, video security and command center software all exist. So, in the case of Avigilon or in a recent acquisition of VaaS, those video streams or that data plugs straight into the command center, so for a customer for example that has our aware product they can have the visibility to the video and/or the VaaS data right on that screen. So, it helps just facilitate the inter-linkages of those platforms not something I would direct you towards to measure in regards to that penetration to those command centers because it also be gated a bit by who uses our aware platform as well. How broadly is, were used? Wear is one of our earlier products and growing pretty rapidly. We don't get into how many piece apps directly use it, yet but that's something that we'll be updating you on the future. So, but it's one of our newer products and it's growing relatively quickly because of its ability to integrate and provide as we say on a single pane of glass, a situation from CAD to mapping, to assets, to VaaS and video and other components. It's a very integrated view to help our customers manage their resources during an emergency. I appreciate the response. Thank you. Thank you.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2019 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services and Software. Greg and Gino will review our results, along with commentary and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today’s earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I will turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I will start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.
So first, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 7%, expanded operating margins by 120 basis points and generated $525 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 55% versus the prior year. Additionally, we ended the quarter with our highest backlog position ever of $11 billion, up $1.6 billion year-over-year and up $160 million sequentially. Second, we continue to execute well across all platforms. Our land mobile radio business is on pace for another record year of sales and earnings led by North America. Our video security business had another strong quarter of revenue growth and is gaining traction with government customers and our command center software business is continuing to drive revenue growth and margin expansion in our Software and Services segment. And finally, based on our Q3 results and our expectations for another solid performance in Q4, we are once again raising our earnings per share estimates for the full year 2019.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning just for some very brief closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q3 includes revenue of $2 billion, up 7% versus last year, including $58 million of revenue from acquisitions and currency headwinds of $21 million. Organic revenue growth was 4%. GAAP operating earnings of $413 million, up $119 million and operating margins of 20.7% of sales compared to 15.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $509 million, up $57 million or 13% and non-GAAP operating margins of 25.5% of sales, up 120 basis points driven by higher sales in gross margins partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 compared to $1.43 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.04, up 5% from $1.94 last year on higher operating earnings offset primarily by a higher effective tax rate. OpEx in Q3 was $504 million, up $40 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $39 million compared to $43 million in the year ago quarter driven primarily by a decrease in net interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 23% compared to 18% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by the recognition of a favorable return to provision adjustment in the prior year.
Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $525 million compared to $338 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $465 million compared with $292 million in the prior year. The higher cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital, a settlement payment in the prior year related to a legacy business and higher earnings. Capital allocation for Q3 included $271 million in cash and equity for the acquisition of WatchGuard, $94 million in cash dividends, $60 million of CapEx and we paid off the $400 million term loan used to acquire Avigilon. Additionally, we agreed to extend our strategic partnership with Silver Lake. As part of the agreement, Silver Lake agreed to make a new $1 billion investment in Motorola Solutions and settled the outstanding $800 million aggregate principal investment 1 year ahead of its maturity. The $800 million principal was settled in cash and the premium was settled with $300 million in cash and $5.5 million in shares. The transaction resulted in an overall reduction to our diluted share count in the quarter.
Moving to segment results, Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.3 billion, up $61 million or 5% driven by the Americas. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $27 million and currency headwinds were $9 million. Operating earnings were $300 million or 22.2% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year on higher sales and gross margins partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include an award from Bell Mobility for the largest Canadian P25 contract in history serving the province of Ontario, $27 million in video security wins in education, a $16 million P25 order from Lee County, Florida, several large awards in mobile and in-car video, including $13 million for the City of Nashville, Tennessee, and $4 million for the Michigan state police and $3 million in fixed video security wins for government customers.
Moving to the Services and Software segment, revenue was $645 million, up $71 million or 12% from last year driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $31 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. Operating earnings were $209 million or 32.4% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion. Notable Q3 wins in the segment include a $78 million dollar P25 multiyear service contract with the state of Michigan extending service through 2029, a $58 million P25 multiyear statewide service contract in North America, and $11 million Command Center Software Suite contract with Glendale, Arizona and a $4 million contract for a 911 system in Bogota, Colombia.
Looking at regional results, America’s Q3 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 12% driven by broad-based growth across all platforms. EMEA Q3 revenue was $384 million, down 1% due to large system deployments in the Middle East in the prior year and currency headwinds partially offset by growth in Europe. And in Asia-Pacific, Q3 revenue was $158 million, down 9% or $16 million due to China and currency headwinds. Ending backlog was $11 billion, up $1.6 billion or 17% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $160 million with growth in both segments. Services and software backlog was up $1.6 billion or 26% compared to last year. Approximately half of the increase was driven by the Americas and half by EMEA. The EMEA growth is primarily related to the ESN and Airwave extensions. Sequentially, backlog was up $34 million due to multiyear contracts in the Americas partially offset by revenue recognition for ESN and Airwave. Products and SI segment backlog was down $39 million or 1% compared to last year, due to two large system deployments during the prior year in the Middle East and Africa partially offset by growth of $134 million in the Americas. Sequentially, backlog was up $126 million driven by the Americas.
Turning to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up 5% to 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.75 and $2.80. This assumes $20 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $176 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue growth of 7.25% to 7.5% and we now expect non-GAAP EPS between $7.77 and $7.82, up from our prior guidance of $7.67 to $7.77. This full year outlook assumes $115 million of FX headwinds at current rates, an effective tax rate of 23.5% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. We continue to expect full-year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.7 billion.
I’d now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thank you, Gino. First, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. It was another quarter of solid organic revenue growth, significant expansion of both gross margins and operating margins. Strong operating cash flow generation of over $0.5 billion and we finished with our highest quarter ending backlog position ever. We also closed the acquisition of WatchGuard, a leader in the in-car and body-worn video. Second, 2019 is looking to be another strong year of growth led by North America, our LMR business is positioned for a second consecutive year of record sales and our command center software and video security businesses continue to perform very well. Given our year-to-date performance and ending backlog, we are positioned for another year of record revenue earnings and cash flow.
And finally, this week at the International Association of Chiefs of Police here in Chicago, we had product introductions that spanned our entire mission critical portfolio including our next-generation LMR Radio APX NEXT, which is broadband enabled for mobile apps designed specifically for first responders. And what struck me the most as they walked our booth, was how the investments in our portfolio have come together, not as point products or separate acquisitions, but as a fully interconnected ecosystem, where mission-critical communications, video security and analytics, command center software and services are operating seamlessly together. And it’s the power of these integrated mission critical solutions that has me excited when I think about our future going forward.
So now I will turn it back over to Tim and open it up for your questions. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you. Maybe just two I will give you together if I can. First on the video side, guys, it sounds like last quarter you were starting to see some traction in the education vertical, I see – do you know you went over a number of video wins kind of across different platforms in the quarter? Could you just talk a little bit about growth there in particularly with the new ban and the NDAA in effect, what are you thinking about growth for that business? And then secondly on the call center software side, it seems like there has been good traction, could you talk a little bit about the trajectory of maybe getting into more piece apps and maybe selling multiple solutions to the ones that you are currently in and how do we think about that adding to the growth for the company? Thank you. Hey, Tim, good evening, it’s Jack. I will take the first question related to video. So as we have discussed before, we expect the video business to grow 15% this year. I will tell you, Q3, the performance exceeded our expectations. Specific to education, we had $27 million in orders in Q3. And if you remember Q2 is typically the high points, so we’re really pleased with $27 million. We got $1 million order from the University of South Carolina. We had not done a lot in higher ed, so again please there. And then I think the last thing is the Federal Bureau of Prisons, we talked about a year kind of a year to take place for the federal government success and that was well in advance of what we expected and think of that as a platform that will build on. I think all these things are empowered by two things. We made pretty significant go-to-market investments in North America, but probably more importantly, we announced the H5 camera line and the Avigilon Control Center, which are software and analytics package 7.0, focus of attention, unusual speed detection, things like that. So a lot of excitement in the market and I think you will continue to see our momentum from there and turn it over in the second half. Tim, it’s Kelly. On the software part, I will address that. First I will just say, we look at the business, we are very pleased with that. Our orders, our revenue and our backlog growth are all exceeding the market growth rate. The team has done a great job showing the benefits of the suite and the customers are definitely recognizing it. Year-to-date as we think about it, you probably referenced in the past, percent of our orders in the command center that our suite related where we have sold two or more components of our software together or where we have added on to already existing pieces of software and added to that. As we look at year-to-date, we are just over 25%, which is an improvement from what we’ve seen in the past. It’s great to see some notable customer wins, you probably saw us reference a particularly large win with Glendale, Arizona, where they bought a pretty much the entire suite, CAD, records, jail, mobility our vast solution as well and integrated those together and also customers like we see in Latin America with the Bogota in Colombia, where we added on a 911 software system in addition to what they already have in regards to CAD and records that they have. So we are seeing good traction across the board on suites and I am pleased with the progress we are seeing also in the development of what Andrew and team were doing there. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. The next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to start by obviously acknowledging a lot of positive to highlight here in the quarter. But Greg, I am going to be brave here and try to paint a narrative that I know has holes in it, but just get it out there, because I know you won’t be shy to respond. You recently announced the new APX NEXT devices that incorporate broadband capability, FirstNet Interoperability and didn’t think there was you were seeing much of the use case for broadband and mission-critical radios and I know that LMR has been doing well, but product backlog is down year-over-year for the second quarter, now. I know Americas is up, but video is doing well and some additional inorganic contribution. So some thought that this is an indication that perhaps broadband and FirstNet is starting to and going to continue to have an impact on the core LMR business, I think you understand the narrative that’s painted there, so just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that? Yes, Adam. Thanks for the question. I don’t think the introduction of APX NEXT has anything to do with a narrative that would suggest LTE or specifically FirstNet taking a more prominent role, but specifically cannibalizing LMR. As you know, Adam, we haven’t seen that in the past. We still don’t see that now. Backlog is up, you know that year-on-year and sequentially. By the way, it’s also worth noting that the backlog is up, despite some significant FX headwinds that we didn’t articulate. But with what Molloy’s team is doing on LMR and the introduction of APX NEXT, which we’re excited about and maybe Jack could say a few words about the feature set. Software connect and seamless roaming between LMR and LTE actually we believe extends LMR. It’s not an encroachment of LTE. It makes LMR, it makes APX NEXT. It makes private networks even more compelling, and I think that’s represented by the statewide upgrades that we had this year that were almost 2x the volume of previous periods. But I just don’t see it that way and I think FirstNet is complementary to LMR, just like in the UK, ESN is complementary to Airwave, but I just don’t see any cannibalization or chilling effect. By the way, just, since we’re talking about FirstNet, as you know, I think, Adam, it has a de minimis impact of revenue for this year. We would see equally minimal revenue contribution from next year. Yes, maybe just to piggyback on top of that, I think this is an important point. As a service or the recurring revenue component of APX NEXT, will actually be contracted through the customer directly to Motorola. And that will be three different things. It will be, obviously, Greg talked a little bit about the SmartConnect, the ability to extend LMR capabilities, for instance if it was somewhat from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office that was at a conference in Miami. They have capability to connect back to the network, but two of the the other really important features are called SmartLocate, which essentially provides paying to every – depending on the situation every 3 seconds to 15 seconds, location device of an Officer critical for Officer safety, but maybe the most important and underrated thing is a feature called Smart Programing, which will essentially take what used to take weeks or months to program radios and essentially provide an out-of-the-box experience. So really what we’re doing is to Greg’s point, extending the LMR P25 network, but leveraging some of the broadband technology to do complementary technologies. The other thing to hit on is the APX NEXT is actually a premium device. So if we think about the APX family that is, quite candidly been the most successful product in the history of this Company. This will be kind of the Cadillac, if you will, or the premium tier and we should think of that is kind of taken three to five years historically. We have a new fleet three to five years to start making – when we start to see the sales pivot to APX NEXT and the next gen of those. So hopefully that answers your question. Yes, very helpful. And it sounds like there is some potentially attractive economic models that could be associated with it as well. Maybe just as a quick follow-up Gino, product and SI operating margins look like, if I am backing into the 2019 guidance correctly, maybe toward the low end of the 22% to 23% range for 2019, and hoping that maybe just double click on that because I know it’s perhaps not exactly like-to-like, but products gross margin and gross profit are up healthily, and operating margin and operating profit are lagging that growth a little bit. I know you have a number of acquisitions weighing, probably some opportunity there. So maybe just some color how we can think about operating leverage in that segment moving forward? Thank you. Sure. Adam, yes the guidance suggests the lower end of that 22% to 23% range. It’s important to note that gross margin is above, slightly above our expectation for the full year. So really the impact is opex related to the acquisition and frankly related to some legal expense related with the Hytera IP lawsuit ongoing this year. So those are the two issues. I’m very pleased with the gross margin, it’s opex will get after the acquisitions and again legal expense until that trial is resolved or that action is resolved. We’ll continue to include that in our guidance. We’re very pleased with the performance – gross margin performance. Yes. Thank you. Your next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks a lot guys. I guess I wanted to kind of drive toward inorganic growth rate for backlog. You mentioned there was an FX impact there. I know it’s pretty substantial last quarter, but I’d be curious on what that number actually was? And then WatchGuard, I would imagine also maybe gave you a bit of backlog benefit there. Also, I was wondering what kind of contribution that might have had? And then I assume the two Middle East deals from a year ago are not backlog affecting as I look at year-on-year compares? Yes, that’s correct. So there are a couple of things there to unpack the – the FX adjustment that Greg mentioned was $115 million sequential, unfavorable FX adjustment. Getting back to your question on the organic growth rate of backlog, so that was the extent of the adjustment. The second question? Was a WatchGuard question? Yes. And that’s really minimal backlog George. It’s kind of a run-rate business with very little backlog, so not much of an impact at all to our backlog. Got it. And then I’m sorry, the year on – can you just tell me the FX impact on a year-on-year basis Its $200 million, George. Okay. So backlog organically, I think grew nicely over 10% year-on-year, is that roughly ballpark? Yes. Great. Okay, super. Thanks a lot. Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, just want to explore a little bit the difference in the growth rates between Europe and North America. I would see North America is on fire now for the past two years or so, if not a little longer. Is the difference in the growth rates more macroeconomic driven or is it more based on the portfolio you have there? And then perhaps you guys touch on the growth or the opportunity with the video segment now with Avigilon and WatchGuard and what your opportunity is outside of the US? Okay, Keith. So I think the question was really around EMEA versus North America. Yes. North America, just from a scale – go-to-market scale points of presence, it’s obviously our strongest market, it’s up – Q3 was up 7% in terms of constant currency and I think as Greg articulated in the open its strength across the board. It’s strength in our LMR business, strength in the command center software business and our services business and obviously we had a very good quarter in our video business. EMEA is actually for – in the third quarter, we’re actually up 2% inorganic constant currency. So some of the things we felt are obviously the headwinds – we’ve had some FX headwinds there, but it was just in Europe, two weeks ago at our partner conference, and there are some challenges in certain countries. But I would dimensionalize Europe is still relatively steady state, where we’re seeing the most pressure internationally is actually in Asia-Pac and to kind of put that into context, it’s 8% of our overall revenue. So not very material, but at the same time we’re seeing macro – we’re seeing some macro level issues. China is very small in terms of what it means from a revenue component of our country, but within the region, we’re seeing some contingents that have actually slowed some things down in certain areas. I’d also offer that when I look at the APAC business, a lot of this is on us and meaning it’s on me and and our team in terms of ability to understand the process a little bit better, where we might have some macro level issues, because budget issues, we’ve got to see through those and we’ve got to execute better as well. But as it applies to Europe, it’s not as strong as North America, obviously, but it’s fairly steady. APAC is really where we’ve seen the primary weakness as the years rolled out. Great. And just kind of expanding on that question, can you just touch on your opportunities with Avigilon and WatchGuard outside of the U.S. and is that a factor helping to drive some of the growth in the U.S. comparatives the EMEA? Yes. So I think we have – in two different things. In Avigilon, we have opportunity in terms of – we’ve got to increase the number of routes to market internationally, that’s in Latin America, that’s in Asia Pacific and that’s in Europe. The work is being done there to really get the product on more shelves. They were – when we acquired Avigilon, they were relatively – their focus was rightfully so in North America. And we’ve got to bring more scale to then both with our sales force and our distribution partners. That’s the first thing. Secondarily, WatchGuard has also been relatively a North America phenomenon. We actually picked up a body worn camera through the Vigilant acquisition, a company based out, who had acquired a company based out of Scotland that actually has a very nice solution internationally at a better price point. So we’re going to look at both of those options to take the body worn camera in international, but WatchGuard is really a North America Solution as it stands today. Great, thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the public sector sales process within command center and surveillance, specifically I’d be interested in your thoughts on the average duration of the process? Any generalities for how relative deal sizes would compare, like traditional LMR deal to the same type of customer? And any high level thoughts you have on the overall competitive landscape right now based on some of the preliminary stuff that you guys are doing? Absolutely, Ben. I will start this is Jack and I think the first part of it is a selling process. And I’m going to – Kelly is going to jump in to provide some color. The selling process in terms of the command center software is actually a fairly lengthy cycle, meaning it’s typically anywhere from minimal a year to two years. There is a high level because it’s a 24/7, a highly intense environment and you’ve got a customer base, meaning dispatchers in our high stress environment. There’s a lot of demonstrability and particularly as they navigate software changes, there is a lot of features that may be were legacy features that we have to kind of deal with because it certainly affects their operating procedures in the command center. So they’re typically long, and I think a credit to the inorganic and organic activity that Kelly and Andrew and team have done, frankly the deal sizes are getting larger. And I think as Kelly articulated, we’ve grown the level of suite services – the suite sales, which have contributed to that. Kelly, I think you want to – anything you want to add to that? Yes, just on the competitive component. You know, look, if you look at the external view across any number of market studies out there, referenced as market growing around a high single-digit growth rate and as we referenced in the past and it has continued to play out, our software business is growing in double digits. So we’re very pleased with what we’re seeing in regards to the growth of the business. I’d also add competitively. I think as you probably saw at IACP, we’ve made a number of announcements around some additional components of our software – command center software portfolio. I’m very happy about what we’re doing. Also, one thing I’d highlight is the records portfolio and what we’re doing there. As we all know, in the command center, one of the biggest things that they deal with is just the inundation of data, pictures, video, voice that they have to handle in that records platform that we announced. It’s something that our customers are very excited about because it provides to have an opportunity with one records platform to be able to manage data that comes in from any variety of sources. So it’s not just managing body-worn video or 911 calls, it’s being able to compose all the data that comes into the command center and be able to manage it. So competitively we view that as something that is really unique part of our software portfolio that no one else can emulate. So very pleased with what we’re seeing there and the customer receptivity and the feedback we’re getting from them has been really great and it shows in the results. And as a follow-up, looking at the broader business, you talked about some of the uncertainty, maybe some more macro in APAC. Do you have any thoughts on a broader macro perspective? As it relates to commercial LMR and then will not upgrade Greg any update to the broader 2021 framework discussion you’ve provided previously? Thanks guys. So there is no updates to the broader 2021, approximately 9 and 10. Remember, it wasn’t guidance, it wasn’t prescriptive it was directional. My phrases up into the right and it contemplates both operating the business and continued inorganic activity. From a 2020 standpoint, we’re not going to guide the specifics as you would expect that will be reserved for our February call. But as I sit here today, kind of high level top-line revenue growth, I think about roughly 4%, which is consistent with what we said this year. Consistent with what we said last year and again overall from a drivers standpoint across all three platforms, LMR and video security and command center software, I feel pretty good about it. By the way, just one other dimensionalize it’s worth mentioning, it may seem a little tactical, but worth reminding. As you all think about 2020, remember Q1 specifically is always our lightest quarter. Q1 of this year was a record quarter that included $40 million of federal revenue in Q1 of ‘19 that we do not expect to repeat in Q1 of 2020. So high level dimensionalize events continued solid growth, obviously a solid backlog position, no change to the 9 and 10 in 2021 and I think the Jack and Kelly and the team and quite frankly, all the people at Motorola continue to do a great job and I appreciate their efforts. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Before I ask questions, I just want to clarify in your response to the previous question, Greg. I thought at one hand end you were giving guidance on the other hand, I think I heard you say 4% revenue growth for next year. Was that the 4% that you cited was that specific to 2020, but... Yes, what I’m not being prescriptive on that specifically on EPS in operating cash and others, but it’s just meant to signal more or less to Ben’s question our view on our expectation of continued growth. We do expect growth. We do expect organic constant currency growth. We do expect cash flow growth. But just to give you an anchor point and a reference point. Yes, as I sit here today, the kind of view of top line was about 4%, very consistent with this year and what we said this year and what we said last year. I appreciate that. I might have two questions. One is a broad question, I apologize, visiting a number of questions earlier in the call. And then a specific question, the broad question is to the extent that video hardware analytics and monitoring along with margins have been the two or I think certainly are two of the key upside opportunities and focuses for the Company. Can you give us any sense of the opportunities from here over the course of the next year in terms of how much more you can do in driving margin upside as well as of WatchGuard and Avigilon in terms of how far how fast that revenue can grow? I recognize you address the things you need to do in terms of outside of the U.S. and their go-to-market etc., but any quantification you could provide? And then the specific question would be, you just referenced U.S. federal passing, a number of companies this quarter cited very strong U.S. federal revenue in the fiscal year-end. Can you characterize what you’re seeing out of U.S. federal? Why doesn’t Jack take U.S. federal first? Yes, so U.S. federal, we’ve – it was not only – we talked about the strength of the North America business and you wouldn’t have a good Q3 without a very strong federal quarter, but I would also offer, it’s been Mark McNulty and federal team has had a very good year in 2019. It’s everything from devices to systems to services and it really spans a continuum of law enforcement agencies in the Fed’s civil agencies as well as our Defense bases in the Communication Systems we supply to them. So proud of what the team accomplished in Q3, but really, we have had a very solid 2019. And Paul just overall, on your question of kind of the overall business, we do expect cash flow and operating margin expansion to continue against the specifics coming on the February call. I think that’s largely going to come out of software and services. I think Kelly and Andrew and his entire team have done a great job on platforming the business, getting efficiencies of the business, integrating the suite. The percentage of suite purchases and orders is slightly incrementally higher than what Kelly referenced earlier. We talked about an operating margin in that segment, software and services on the last call of 30% to 31%, that’s going to look like, more like 31% for full year ‘19. Do we expect that can improve in 2020? We do? And Kelly and Andrew will provide me and all of us with the specifics on 2020, but also what I would say is the areas that we’re playing in. Video security, where we’ve targeted to grow 3x the market, all in 15% versus 5% and as Jack referenced in Q3 we were strong in Q3, and we still believe will grow at 15% for 2019 and that continues. On command center software, it’s performing in the high teens and again for now we expect that to continue. So – and that’s against the backdrop of an addressable market of all of these businesses land, mobile, radio, video security and analytics and command center software of an addressable market we size that about $39 billion for 2020. So I think there is room to run. I think Molloy and Kaczynski are executing very well with the Avigilon acquisition and the other video assets. That is we aggregate and go to market in an integrated way, we’ll continue that performance and I think command center software and services, which we don’t talk as much about though that too is continuing to run very well. So there is opportunity. There is a sizable addressable market, you know the numbers that we’re growing and command center software and video security, I think land mobile radio including SI and services all in will continue to move forward. By the way, we will also consciously move more and more land, mobile, radio product to land, mobile, radio infrastructure as a service which will improve stickiness, improve annuity revenue in that segment and overall solidify the profile of our position competitively. So, I feel good about where we are and how we’re executing. There is always a lot more work to do, but this is a solid quarter, it’s going to be, it should be, we expect it to be a record year in ‘19. And then we’ll update you on all the specifics with those metrics in 2020. I appreciate the response. Thanks Greg. The next question is from Brian Yoon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the prior answer you had for a baseline of 4% revenue growth in 2020. Can you talk about the levers there? So what do you think could drive better than expected, top-line? Is it an uptick in video security adoption or new product intro and is there anything we should be aware of that could pressure revenue growth from that baseline? I think, look at this point, I think it’s just a prudent way to plan the business as we look at 2020. Molloy, talked about – North America has been great and the execution across pretty much all platforms. He talked about a little bit of international, more specifically Asia-Pac, where we see budgets being pushed out. I don’t think its deals lost. Now Asia-Pac is 8% of our overall revenue in ‘19 and as you know, China is now about 1.5% of revenue for us. So it’s not significant. The issue though is, as the China economy slows down, does it have a contagion effect in some other adjacent or neighboring theaters in the region. It may, but also as Jack said we on the execution side can do a better job in terms of forecasting specificity and understanding budget cycles and what’s available. So I think it really is just the best way in the prudent way we think to plan the business, video security in Q3 was stronger than our expectations. So are there areas that we could perform stronger against that view of course, there are potentially there are, but at this point, we think this is the right way to think about it, dimensionalize it again as I sit here today. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. The first question has to do with products, just SI, and I want to understand beyond the big lumpy deals. The way you generate some of those revenues, could you give us any idea on the type of radios that were sold? Are these higher mix? Are you starting to see the installed base refresh their products? If there is a cycle where are we in that cycle or are some of the growth being driven by Avigilon products on the hardware side, can you just unpack this a little bit more for us, so we can go through it? I’ll – hey Sami, it’s Jack. Two things, so for the third quarter, what we’ve seen from Products and SI, it’s both. Actually to your point, Avigilon, albeit Avigilon had a very good quarter so we’re going to see some of that. As we think about the LMR products that are in there, we had, we had strength really frankly in devices. So that’s APX devices, the APX family of which we just announced, kind of the next generation or the APX NEXT. And that strengthened the U.S. government, U.S. public safety state and local, as well as the federal government, which I just articulated had a very good quarter. Gino, I don’t know if there’s anything you’d like…. Yes, I think – I think you answered your Jack. it’s really on the product side, strength across the board in Q3, there wasn’t one area that was exceptional. No large deal in there that drove the results, it was broad-based, actually across all platforms, but across all the product segment. The commercial – the commercial business was actually up 3% in North America in Q3 as well, so just like a – just pretty much strength across the board. Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question regarding Avigilon and some of the more software/artificial intelligence related capabilities that the software actually has, where are we in the integration cycle for specifically those capabilities into the broader command center suite? Sami, I’ll take that. In regards to Avigilon, one of the things that we’ve done, we’re very pleased about is, we’ve immediately taken the Avigilon portfolio and to the extent our public safety customers are using Avigilon, we have already integrated into our command center suite. So, one of the products, which you probably saw us announce earlier in the year is CommandCentral Aware. The CommandCentral Aware is a product which helps gives our customers a consolidated view in the command center of a situation including location of officers, information related to the 911 call, any inputs around license plates and in addition to that, to the extent they access Avigilon cameras, they can have that feed into the command center. So it’s not just Avigilon, we work with a lot of other video suppliers out there because it’s important as being in the command center, that being kind of the central point where situations are controlled that we can interface to others. But of course interfacing to Avigilon is something that we incorporated earlier this year. It’s just one of the examples of the integration components that we provided through the command center. Great. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tim Yocum for any closing remarks. Thanks for joining guys and we look forward to talking to most of you soon. Take care. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation.

And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon and thanks everybody for joining us today.
I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business, before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter capping another record year for the company. We grew revenue 5%, expanded operating margins by 80 basis points, generated $795 million of operating cash flow.
Additionally we ended the quarter with our highest backlog position ever of $11.3 billion, up $659 million year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially. Second, our full year 2019 results exemplify the strength of our business.
In our Products segment we grew revenue mid-single digits, driven by a second consecutive year of record land mobile radio sales in North America, as well as strong growth in our video security business.
In Software and Services, we grew revenue double digits. And expanded operating margins by 330 basis points, on strong demand for our Command Center Software solutions and continued growth in our services business.
And finally, as I look to 2020, our record backlog position coupled with the investments in our Command Center Software and video security portfolios position us well, for another year of organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation.
I'll now turn the call over to Gino, to provide additional details on Q4 results and 2020 outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg.
Q4 includes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 5% including $82 million of revenue from acquisitions and $17 million of currency headwinds. GAAP operating earnings of $590 million, up $74 million and operating margins of 24.8% of sales compared to 22.9% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $707 million, up $57 million or 9% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.7% of sales, up 90 basis points from 28.8%, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.39 compared to $2.44 in the year ago quarter. The current year quarter includes a noncash charge of $1.53 per share related to actions taken to de-risk $1 billion in pension obligations.
Non-GAAP EPS of $2.94, up 12% from $2.63 last year on higher operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate. OpEx in Q4 was $523 million, up $40 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22% and compared to 23.5% in the prior year.
For the full year, revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7%, driven by growth in the Americas. Revenue from acquisitions was $312 million and currency headwinds were $113 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up $326 million or 26%, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2 billion, up $235 million or 14%. And non-GAAP operating margins were 25% of sales, up 130 basis points, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.
GAAP earnings per share, was $4.95 compared to $5.62 in the prior year. The current year included a noncash charge of $1.53 per share related to actions taken to de-risk $1 billion in pension obligations.
Non-GAAP EPS was $7.96, up 11% from $7.50 in 2018 on higher sales and operating earnings partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and a higher diluted share count in 2019. For the full year, OpEx was $2 billion, up $158 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2019 was 22.4% compared to 21.7% in the prior year.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $795 million compared to $812 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $736 million compared with $743 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.8 billion up $748 million and free cash flow was $1.6 billion up $697 million. The increase in cash flow was driven by the impact of the $500 million pension contribution made in 2018, higher operating earnings, and improved working capital.
Capital allocation for 2019 included $709 million of acquisitions, $379 million in cash dividends and $350 million in share repurchases at an average price of $137.35. Additionally during the year, we repaid the remaining $400 million balance on the term loan used to acquire Avigilon. We refinanced approximately $800 million of senior unsecured debt extending our debt maturity profile.
We settled the initial 5-year convertible note with Silver Lake, one year ahead of its maturity and extended the relationship with a new 5-year convertible note that expires in 2024. And finally, we reduced $1 billion in pension obligations, through a lump sum window, paying approximately $836 million out of pension plan assets, to participants who elected this offer.
Moving to segment results, Q4 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.7 billion up $3 million with growth in the Americas and Asia Pac, offset by a decline in the Middle East and Africa.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million. And currency headwinds were $9 million. Q4 Products and Systems, a segment operating margins were $484 million or 28.9% of sales, flat with the prior year. Higher gross margin in the current year was offset by higher OpEx primarily from acquisitions.
Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in the segment include a $64 million P25 order for the state of Arkansas, a $36 million P25 order from Thurston County Washington, a $24 million P25 order for Luzerne County Pennsylvania and $5 million in fixed video security wins for government customers.
Additionally during the quarter, we launched our next-generation P25 radio, APX NEXT as well as our Avigilon AI-powered H5 camera line. For the full year Products and Systems Integration revenue was $5.3 billion, up $229 million or 5% on growth in the Americas.
Revenue from acquisitions was $157 million and FX headwinds were $54 million. Products and Systems Integration operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 22% of sales, up slightly from the prior year on higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher OpEx related to acquisitions.
Moving to the Software and Services segment, Q4 revenue was $704 million, up $120 million or 21% from last year, driven by growth in all regions. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. And currency headwinds were $8 million.
Operating earnings were $223 million or 31.7% of sales up, 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales gross margins and improved OpEx leverage. Notable Q4 wins in the segment include, $8 million Command Centers suite order from Tulare County California, $6 million Command Center Software suite order from the Irvine California police department; $6 million for a computer-aided dispatch system for the city of Atlanta, Georgia; a $68 million P25 multiyear service contract with the State of Victoria in Australia; a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with the State of Connecticut and a $24 million P25 multiyear service contract with the U.S. Navy.
For the full year, Software and Services revenue was $2.6 billion, up $315 million or 14% with growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue from acquisitions was $155 million and FX headwinds were $59 million. Software and Services operating earnings in 2019 were $802 million or 31.4% of sales, up 330 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and gross margin and improved OpEx leverage.
Looking at regional results. Americas Q4 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 10%, driven by broad based growth across LMR services, video security and Command Center Software. For the full year, Americas' revenue was $5.7 billion, up 12% with growth in both segments. EMEA Q4 revenue was $448 million, down 9% due to large system deployments in the Middle East and Africa in the prior year, partially offset by growth in Europe.
For the full year, EMEA revenue was $1.6 billion, down 3% due to FX headwinds and declines in the Middle East and Africa, partially offset by growth in Europe. And in Asia Pac, Q4 revenue was $214 million up, 6% or $12 million, driven by growth in Australia. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue was $657 million down 3%, driven by China and FX headwinds.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $11.3 billion, up $659 million or 6% compared to last year. Sequentially backlog was up $217 million, driven by growth in software and services. Software and Services backlog was up $699 million or 9% compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America as well as the ESN contract extension.
Sequentially backlog was up $261 million with growth in all regions. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog was down $40 million or 1% compared to last year, driven by the Middle East and Africa. Sequentially backlog was down $44 million with growth in the Americas offset by declines in EMEA and Asia Pac.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 2% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.30 and $1.35. This assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 20% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 4% with non-GAAP EPS between $8.65 and $8.80 per share.
This full year outlook assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%, weighted average diluted share count between 176 million and 177 million shares and full year OpEx down $60 million versus 2019. We expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks Gino.
And let me just close with a few final thoughts. First 2019, was an outstanding year. Our land mobile radio business had a second consecutive record year in North America, while our Video Security and Command Center Software businesses both exceeded our expectations.
Second, I was particularly pleased by the performance of Software and Services during the year, which now makes up roughly one-third of our overall sales and is a proxy for our recurring revenue.
The demand for our integrated Command Center Software suite drove strong revenue. And backlog growth in our Software business, while our Services business grew mid-single digits organically, led by another strong year in North America.
Additionally, we expanded operating margins in the segment by 330 basis points, which drove overall operating margin expansion of 130 basis points for the company. And finally, I think we're very well positioned for another strong year in 2020.
We serve large addressable markets. We have a seasoned team, focused on consistent execution. And the investments we've made in North America along with our Command Center Software and video security portfolios will continue to drive organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion, EPS growth of at least 2 times revenue growth and strong free cash flow over the long-term.
I'll now turn it back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line, how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Yes just one and then the follow-up, I'll give you them both you guys can pick. So first, maybe on the targets for 2021 the $9 billion in revenues and $10 in EPS, talk a little bit how we're going to get there. It seems like given the strong margins and OpEx management EPS seems a little easier than the revenues but if you could just touch on that a little bit?
And secondly, might be related that organic growth in Q1 is kind of low. I'm wondering if there's other large deals that impact that kind of like they did in Q4. And then also, looking at the 4% for the year, you do have a little bit of M&A help and you have bigger contribution from software and video. So just curious if something is going on in the LMR side of the business, when you look into the full year 2020? Thank you. Yes so first, in terms of the concept of nine and 10 in 2021, I think I've been pretty consistent in saying approximately nine and approximately 10 in 2021. Tim, it's meant – it was always meant to be directional and not prescriptive or specific guidance. And as you mentioned, I think it also includes and contemplates both organic and inorganic. I think that you see the guide for both Q1 and the full year in 2020 on top of what we did in 2019 and I like the progression and the path that we're on.
You're right that if you extrapolate that out, it will likely be closer to approximately 10 on the bottom. And then on the top but again it contemplates both organic and inorganic and we'll see how that develops. In terms of Q1 specifically, I would just say that a couple of things. We're coming off of two consecutive record years. The previous year comp in Q1 of last year was 13% growth. And as we referenced and have been consistent, that included of the timing of a $40 million Fed order in Q1 that when you normalize for the timing of that, I think you feel a little bit better.
The linearity of Q1 is consistent with the last several years. It's about 20%. It’s always our smallest quarter. And with the exception of the anomaly of last year, I think it's consistent and in line with the way our business generally flows. The final point I'd make too is that, are all in 4% growth for 2020 is generally balanced with a little bit less than 4% growth in the first half, 4% growth in the second half and the 4% overall numbers consistent with what I mentioned a quarter ago.
From a composition standpoint, we still expect growth overall in LMR all in with services in 2020. And we believe video security will grow again. We expect that in the 15% range and command center software in high teens. So all in all, I think balanced strong across multiple platforms, but that gives you the color of Q1 in 2020 as well as your 2021 question. The next question will be from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, George. Perhaps your line is muted on your end. We’ll move to our next question. Sorry about that? There you go we can hear you now sir. Can you hear me great, apologies. All right so on Avigilon, you've been talking about a 15% growth target for 2019 to confirm you guys hit that or beat that. I am curious what that business grew for you last year. And then again you mentioned 15% kind of growth aspiration for this year again in video?
I'd love to get an update on kind of where you are in terms of investing in that business and starting to get leverage in terms of your government opportunities, international opportunities just give us an update on the progress there? Thanks. So, just overall on the business and then Jack could comment on the investments in the any other composition of your question. But we did grow 15% actually a little bit better but so it exceeded our expectations in 2019. I'm really pleased with the acquisition. And I'm particularly pleased with Malloy, John Kedzierski, all the Avigilon team of the way it's been integrated the way we're investing, the way we're refreshing, the way we're expanding go-to-market.
And we do expect again growth around 15% for that business which I remind you is about 3x the market. Yes the only color I'd add Greg, just in terms of the investment George we invested fairly significantly in terms of go-to-market in North America in the first quarter last year. I think that helped attribute to the momentum. As Greg indicated, we picked up in the second half of the year. The other piece of it is it's obviously a very innovation-driven market. We launched – we had a relatively large-scale launch with our AI-powered H5 camera line.
And again, the Q4 success and even what we're seeing in terms of pipeline build is very encouraging. The last piece of it as we formulated a government sales team and we did Gino made mention of it. We did $5 million in sales half of that was in the federal government market, which is really the longest selling cycle. So, all in we're encouraged in terms of the markets.
Internationally, one of the investments we're making now is really focused on routes to market, taking our go-to-market coverage and getting into new countries that Avigilon was not in when we acquired them. So I think, some work to do there but definitely, I think some opportunity as well. Yes just George one other thing, just to complement the team, one of the verticals that I think has been the strongest-performing is education in the notion of safe schools. I think, it's been the sweet spot of demand for Avigilon. And Jack and team are going to make even more investments to expand the width and breadth of our reach in that vertical nationwide. I think its front and center with so many school systems and county-wide education systems.
This whole notion of safe students and doing the, necessary protection around perimeter and anomaly detection and motion detection. So, we're investing more in that vertical. And we're investing and integrating, the end-to-end Avigilon video, security and analytics system, integrated with our existing land mobile radio. So stay tuned on that front for more updates over time in both the education vertical and a few others. But that's been high demand for us. Our next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Gino a question for you just a little bit more details on the numbers. It looks like R&D stepped up quite a bit this quarter. Is that kind of a new run rate to think about that? And is there specific areas I guess you're expanding the R&D in order to capture I guess more future opportunities? Yes as we talked about the increase, Keith was attributable to acquisitions. We will continue to rationalize spend. We have made incremental investments, in our growth businesses. Both Jack mentioned go-to-market as well as additional investments in R&D with the new camera as well as in command center software and we continue to drive costs out of the overall business. So I talked about a $60 million reduction, in 2020.
So what you're seeing in 2019 is really a function of the acquisitions coming on. And as we work through cost structures across the acquisitions and more so across the underlying business you'll see that come down. And then quick follow-up, in terms of the license plate reader business and the WatchGuard can you guys give a little bit color on how those acquisitions are performing for you? Yes sure Keith its Jack so related to WatchGuard one of the encouraging things we have with WatchGuard and with VaaS is really the ability to first bundle mobile in car video with license plate recognition, software and ultimately look at those as a platform. So we've - Q4 last year we announced our 4RE, mobile video, WatchGuard, that's integrated with license recognition. That's tied to our learned database which is the biggest license plate recognition database in the market.
Early returns from customers that tell us, this gives them better evidentiary management, as well as it improves officer safety. So, we're encouraged by both of these and I'd remind you that WatchGuard is the leading player in-car video. We see more and more of the body warrant and in-car video sales being tethered together. And obviously our go-to-market scale in North America is significant. So, we really like both of those acquisitions. The next question will be from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Greg, I know it's not a normal practice to talk about individual contracts, but the state of Florida LMR deal was a landmark one that you've talked about in the past as an example of kind of the threat of LTE cannibalization being overblown. It seems like some potentially unattractive terms being asked of you based on what's being reported on that and I don't think you've come to an agreement, but just hoping for a little bit more color why. I'm not sure if those terms are boiler plate. They've been agreed to in the past? And what has changed to see such a big deal that seems like it maybe falling through? Yes Adam thanks. So first of all, I mean just to paint the picture and remind everybody we did anticipate getting state of Florida. We didn't. I think it was largely a result of over 1.5 years of delays in lawsuits and appeals primarily by the incumbent competitor. On top of that there's been some administration management changes. But I think it's fair to say that there was fluidity and scope and some design assumptions.
Now having said that, we have an extensive presence throughout the state already. We still look forward to participating in what the state of Florida decides to do next. The project by the way was never in backlog, while we did anticipate signing it.
We didn't. And it was going to be a managed service, so it would have been I think about $13 million to $15 million a year over several years. I think we're going to stay engaged with the state of Florida. We would like to think there's still opportunity to reengage and participate in that going forward.
In terms of overall demand for LMR, as I mentioned, we've had two record years back-to-back we've had the state of Pennsylvania. We have the state of Iowa. And there's a whole - we had the largest LMR deal in the history of the company in Canada. So LMR is - remain strong.
And these deals are - continue to come in and they're usually accompanied with seven and 10 and 12-year maintenance contracts as well. I think the state of Florida had a lot of factors involved. We would still like to participate and hope we have a role going forward, but that's really the state of play at this point in time. And just as a follow-up kind of circling back on some of the things that you said in the prepared remarks at the end. The 2020 guidance I think implies somewhere around low double-digit operating profit dollar growth on 4% revenue growth. I know that leverage is something that you've done in years past but largely through a lot of cost optimization programs. And I think the composition of profit dollar growth and leverage is becoming more a function of scaling the software and services piece.
So I'm hoping that maybe you could just touch on that dynamic the change in composition of profit dollar growth and leverage and double-click on where you see software and services margins moving to in 2020. So, there was a lot, but we still think the business can - we expect it to grow all in 4%. We do think that video security solutions will grow at 15% Command Center Software in the high-teens.
As I've commented before, as it relates to China, our China revenue continues to fall off largely as expected, in an accelerated way, just to contextualize that Mainland China was about $120 million of revenue in 2019.
I think that's going to be cut in half, in 2020, more pronounced, not unanticipated, but more pronounced and reflective of our strategy around China. And we've been deemphasizing that theater for the last several years.
So, I think we will A, continue to grow organically. I think LMR continues to grow all in inclusive of services the video security and command center software. I mentioned, services will grow should grow mid-single digits.
From an operating leverage standpoint, as Gene mentioned we think OpEx goes down $60 million, largely normalized and optimized from G&A rationalization from acquisitions made previously. But Software and Services will continue to grow high single digit.
That's what we anticipate. And from an operating margin standpoint I think that Software and Services will be about 33%, expanding over 2019. And we would see and anticipate the product segment operating margin expanding as well. The next question is from Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research. Just one clarification, then kind of a more detailed strategy question. And the clarification question is, if I got my memory correct, which it could very well be wrong.
The long-term guidance that you gave of the $9 billion sales and $10 in EPS, not guidance, but say let's call it, goal or whatever for 2021, that does include unannounced M&A?
But for the 2020 guidance for this year, the sales of 4% plus or minus on the EPS that does not include unannounced M&A that hasn't been announced yet? So that's kind of my clarification question.
Then my strategy question, Greg, when you look at running the company for 2020 what's kind of the maybe one or two variables to the upside or downside that you're taking a look at, whether it's state budgets or there are a couple of big contract renewals from competitors or within yourself that come up for renewal? Just so we can think about some of the key factors you're looking at for 2020. Thank you. Sure. So Jim your memory is correct. The approximate nine and 10 does contemplate future acquisitions. And you're also correct, that our 2020 guidance that we're confirming today does not, so you're right on that front.
In terms of kind of overall levels and thinking about 2020, I like the fact that we have record backlog. I like the fact that more of the revenue is dimensionalized toward a recurring theme, vis-à-vis software and services.
I'm really pleased with Kelly Mark and Andrew Sinclair and Jack Molloy and John Kedzierski. And I don't say that conveniently or to be nice and give the commercial for those guys. They've done an excellent job on two of these growth strategies that are very critical to us going forward.
And at the same time, land mobile radio all in continues to be steady product and services and will grow. The variables you always think about is there a geopolitical event that could happen? Maybe, who knows? The coronavirus is relatively - maybe it isn't early in its stages. We'll see. We don't think that impacts us at this point in time.
But we'll see how that plays out. This is also an election year and sometimes, if there's a change in administration that could provide a temporary pause or dislocation. I don't know if that's 2020 or 2021. But that's going to be an interesting set of dynamics to watch that whole political theater unfold.
I think overall state budgets in the U.S. are solid. I think the U.S. federal budgets are solid. We've talked about tailwinds with the National Defense Authorization Act. FX is very muted for us in 2020. As we sit here today maybe $10 million of headwind. So, I think our guidance and our view is balanced, prudent, but I like the underlying strength of the business, the performance drivers and the execution by which we're achieving. And our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. I wanted to start, if you could just talk specific to public sector surveillance opportunities. Historically, it seems like Avigilon has disproportionately been weighted towards enterprise. How do you feel about the progress you are making? What's the visibility on large deal opportunities as it relates to public sector customers? Ben, its Jack. So we've - I made a comment earlier that we put a team that was specifically focused at state and local. Really when we think about local it's local it's citywide video security systems. I think we've talked about before that we manage the city of Chicago. But just last year, we had opportunities that we won in Cleveland and in Dallas as well. So we've got opportunities.
We've got relationships. I'm actually very encouraged. What we typically see with citywide safe city opportunities that they typically do a pilot in an area particularly in the central business district or an area that's very hard by crime and build out. So they are kind of elegant thing. When we secure those deals there's a scalability that will happen in 20 - this year 2020 and 2021 as they make sustained investments in those networks as well. And looking at command center, where do you think customers are in their PSAT modernization efforts. Is it still ultra early innings and things get a lot better from here, just any high-level thoughts on where that market is and its evolution? Ben, its Kelly. I think it's still early innings on the PSAT modernization. Certainly, we're starting to see some moves with some of the larger cities out there in regards to building into the ESN as you probably heard us talk about it which is the more advanced way to bring multimedia to 911 call centers, but I'd say that's still early innings.
The impact of that eventually, it will drive churn of software because they'll have to update the software which sort of sits downstream from that 911 call to be able to handle the multimedia, but that also falls within the normal budget cycle that they have to prioritize. So it's not as if it will drive a tremendous acceleration, but certainly something that we'll see happen over the next many years. The next question is from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Can you break out the full year growth by region give us some sense of how - if there's any differences between the regions? Yes. Paul, its Jack. Well, when you think about it North America last year we grew 13% in 2019; 7% in constant currency this year in 2020. And by the way, I do want to note North America, it's particularly important that we grew across LMR had tremendous success in Command Center Software as well as in our video security business. We actually expect continued growth across all platforms. We expect growth in North America in the federal government area in Canada as well as in the U.S. and state and local.
As we think about Europe, EMEA last year we had a - it's important to note EMEA was down in 2019, 3%. Most of that was driven really by a culmination of two things: two deals in the Middle East; two nationwide deployments, one in Northern Africa and one in the Middle East that created a tough comp. Also we were in a tough FX environment last year, but we did grow in Europe both in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. And in 2020 we expect the region in whole to grow not only in Europe, but the Middle East and Africa as well.
And then lastly in Asia Pac. And I think Greg made mention this is we expect Asia Pac to decline slightly this year. And really that's driven by the fact that our revenue in China will be cut in half. The rest of Asia Pac is fairly stable for us, but it's just the planned continued deterioration of revenue in China that really impacts Asia Pac. And Greg, I'd take your point that the change in the administration might cause a pause in spending. What happened in prior presidential cycles that you can call out as material if anything? Well, I mean, I think just in general whether it's Republican or Democrat it wasn't meant to be a partisan comment. But whenever there's a change there's typically you go through a new cycle they appoint new people and cabinet members, they reconstruct the budget. There may or may not be a continuing resolution. The budget details need to be solidified which really are foundational to what they will spend the first few quarters after the election. I think that's what we've experienced in the past. I think that's exactly right. The other piece of it is just what happens in the House and Senate and are there changes there that might change budget priorities as well. But as Greg said it's not - we've had very good years in Democratic administrations and very good years in Republican administrations. It's really just how quickly can get can they get the agency heads in place that can start to set the wheels in motion for both our customers and our team. The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Appreciate that this might have been asked in different forms. But if I remember correctly last year you spoke about gross margin uplift being the largest driver of operating margin uplift with OpEx being relatively flattish, but not down and you delivered on that. This year you're talking about OpEx declining once again by $60 million. I don't think I heard you referenced gross margin. If you did I apologize. What should we expect from gross margin relative to the opportunity for operating margin uplift for incremental leverage? Yes, Paul, this is Gino. We did not mention it, but really the expectation from - in the product segment is for gross margins to be comparable to what they were in 2019 and continued expansion in software and services from 2019 into 2020. And as a follow-up, I appreciate that both of you have done a very good job trying to herd the cats and keep expectations in line. So Greg and you will apologize if this goes in the other direction. But you're telling us that you expect China to be down by $60 million or so to get cut in half.
So starting out if we normalize for China, your organic growth, your normalized growth looks more like 5%. And I'm asking obviously a longer-term question here. And then if I think about the growth you're putting up in command and control software and video of 15 to high teens as those grow as a percentage of revenue and as LMR comes down as a percentage of revenue that should obviously have an uplift long-term on growth all the things being equal.
I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way if we think about longer-term growth as you go forward in time. I appreciate large numbers. But when I look at what's going on in your business, it sounds like growth should actually trend up over time? Well, so kind of a couple of things. In the context of 2020, we went through that. I appreciate the question and I understand where you're coming from. You are right that over time as software and services and video security obviously Command Center Software that are growing substantially faster and become a greater from a contribution standpoint that should provide lift both from a growth rate and an organic growth rate. And we would anticipate that trend over time. We're only guiding for 2020.
The China being cut in half is much more pronounced. So China was down $20 million in 2019 against 2018. It's much more pronounced this year. It's not unexpected. I think it's related to a lot of the things we've been doing and decisions that we've made proactively with China. So that's not unanticipated.
But also I think in the context of the overall guidance, I think it's appropriate to be prudent. By the way some of this growth remember, the other trend here is incrementally things that were sold as CapEx that might roll to the top line growth number to take 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 go more toward annuity revenue multi-year annual recurring.
So as we move some product to incremental annual recurring revenue that would temper down top line growth as we transition over time, but enhance the longevity and durability and predictability of the cash flow. So there's -- it's that dynamic as well. But all-in, pleased with where we are record backlog, high-growth businesses performing and LMR as well. Remember coming off two record years that's important to understand. And the LMR business being longer sales cycle and a little bit lumpy in nature. 2020 is reflective of that, but that too is still growing all-in with services. Greg I appreciate the response. To be clear I was looking for you to change the 2020 guidance, it was in the longer-term and prepare it correctly? Yes. No, no, I know, I appreciate it. And I totally understand where you're coming from. The next question is from Fahad Najam with Cowen. I wanted to see if you can address something that hasn't really come up lately is the opportunity in the public LTE or private LTE space for you guys. I assume that with your video increased growing portfolio of video services that is a synergy with your private LTE offerings. Can you speak to any incremental deployments you've had with your private LTE offerings? Fahad, its Jack and it's a good question. If you think about our LTE offerings, historically, we've got a couple of things. We've talked about FirstNet. We think there are muted expectations for FirstNet in North America. But LTE to the enterprise is where we've got significant opportunity. We announced a CBRS portfolio last March at our channel partner Expo. We won some of our first deals with a big health care system out west. So we're encouraged by that.
We also have a 900 megahertz offering to the utility space that we announced last week, at Distributech. And think of this as being something that actually takes advantage of existing P25 footprint. So less sites, better return on investment for utilities, leverages higher power capabilities and in SP25 and essentially LTE capabilities standing side-by-side. The last thing is LTE it will be an enabler for APX Next device which is our public safety police fire EMS device targeted.
And that if you remember that's got P25 capabilities. But also it will have 5G capabilities, resident in the device, that's going to have LMR flow through capabilities there. So, really it's coming at a number of different things, device opportunities in public safety, and some software opportunities in public safety on FirstNet. And then in infrastructure as well as device opportunities in the enterprise space, namely utilities and health care et cetera. I appreciate it. And if I could maybe ask you about the competitiveness of your video products, one of your competitors had talked about their wins at Fresno and Cincinnati. But I just want to understand how competitively products are coming together. You've got WatchGuard and your other video platform. Can you speak to the competitiveness and improved competitiveness of your product offerings relative to your competitors? Yes. I think, end-to-end our video business is obviously as you mentioned we've got a fixed video security analytics business and Avigilon. It's the only end to end game in town. Everything from AI-powered cameras at the edge to video management systems to - a part that we don't talk about a lot and that's access control, Greg talked a little bit earlier about education and I think access control is every bit as important to our story as we secure campuses and the like.
When we think about our video business in the public safety and I talked about earlier, again we're the only one we got the only ones at an end-to-end story there. We've got not only on body. We're the leading in car video provider. But we've also got LPR capabilities. But more importantly, our learn database is the most robust database in play and content matters.
As you well know, we've got over 20 billion plates in the system. So, we think we're pulling the story together. We've actually consolidated our sales teams in public safety directed at video, because through the acquisitions we had different people point in different places. We've aggregated those teams have them under a central leader now and we're focused on getting after the public safety space. But I think from the innovation standpoint from our portfolio we've got everything we need to execute. [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. On your video win in the quarter that was for $5 million. And I appreciate some of the comments you gave regarding your federal sales team that has been ramping up. But was this in any way related to the NDAA policy or did the NDAA policy went to your advantage to win this actual conduct or was this completely unrelated to the NDAA policy that actually boxed out some of the Chinese vendors? Sami, the NDAA I think we've dimensionalized it as being a tailwind to our business. It's created a favorable environment for Avigilon. But I would tell you I think it's more of a result of having the right portfolio, the right focus and the right relationships and the ability to navigate the federal government sales cycle. I'd probably attribute more of success to Mark McNulty and Jim Mears and their teams and getting after that business. I think that's it. Yes. Yes. And the only other thing I'd add on the video again as you think about the video assets we've acquired and aggregated in 2019 they're roughly all in about $700 million in revenue. That includes fixed video, in car video, body-worn video, license plate recognition video. We feel very good about the end-to-end system orientation strong AI edge analytics. And then we take those and integrate them into our incumbency around land mobile radio for a pretty powerful ecosystem around mission-critical communications and analytics. So that's the path we're on. And then one follow-up is, if you look at the - all your comment center contracts that you've been signing and winning over every quarter, has the average size of these contracts from a dollar perspective started getting larger or is it very in line on a quarterly basis? Or was it very in line in 4Q 2019 versus the prior three quarters? Sami, it's Kelly. We are seeing the contracts start to get a bit larger as we see the bundles and the suites, certainly referencing a couple of large ones as we did in the earnings materials with Irvine. So as we see the customers step in rather than just buy a point product like CAD or records, they're now bundling more and more together. So that will lead to a bit more of an influx in regards to the size of those happen. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks. Nothing else to add. I appreciate everyone joining today and we'll talk to many of you soon. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join the Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we’ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks Time. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I’ll start off by sharing a few thoughts on the business before Gino takes us through our Q1 results and second quarter outlook.
First, I'd like to start by thanking our more than 17,000 people around the world for their resilience, adaptability and unwavering commitment to our customers. We made the decision in mid-March to have the vast majority of our workforce do their jobs remotely and they've successfully and smoothly transitioned to their new environments. Those who needed to work on-site have shown a fearless dedication to our customers, leaving the safety of their homes to ensure that our mission critical operation centers and customer sites remain reliable and always on.
I’d also like to say that we're deeply thankful for the actions of the public safety and healthcare professionals that are keeping us and our community safe, and we're acutely aware of our responsibility to them during these unprecedented times. Because of this, our employees have gone to great lengths to continue to support them and I could not be more proud of their efforts.
Second, despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19 we grew earnings per share by 16% during the quarter, expanded operating margins by 200 basis points and generated $308 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 23% versus the prior year. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our Video Security Solutions, highlighted by a $28 million order from a large utility in North America, the single largest order in the history of the Avigilon business, and our Software & Services segment grew sales by 13% and expanded operating margins by 520 basis points.
And finally, while the COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the fundamental need for our mission critical solutions, it's also brought uncertainties surrounding its severity, impact and duration. So as a result we made the decision to withdraw our full year guidance at this time. We'll reassess this decision at the end of the second quarter based on the information and clarity we have at that time.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over Gino to provide additional details on Q1 and our second quarter outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q1 includes revenue of $1.7 billion, flat versus a year ago, including $48 million of revenue from acquisitions and $7 million of currency headwind. GAAP operating earnings of $259 million is up $30 million and operating margin of 15.6% of sales compared to 13.8% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $347 million up $32 million or 10% and non GAAP operating margins of 21% of sales, up 200 basis points from 19%, driven by higher gross margin.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.86 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 up 16% from $1.28 last year on higher operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.
OpEx in Q1 was $451 million, down $15 million versus last year, primarily due to lower incentives and lower legal expenses, partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q1 effect of tax rate was 15% compared to 20% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits and share based compensation.
Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow was $308 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $260 million compared with $185 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital.
Capital allocation for the quarter included $253 million of share repurchases, $109 million in cash dividends, $48 million of CapEx and $36 million for acquisition. Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we made the decision to draw down $800 million from our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and have an additional $1.4 billion of committed undrawn capacity remaining on the revolver.
We've also taken numerous actions over the past several years to restructure our debt maturity profile and de-risk our pension liability. As a result, we have no debt maturities in 2020 or 2021 absent the revolver and no expected pension contribution until 2023. The strong liquidity position and balance sheet provides us with the capital deployment flexibility for acquisition opportunity in the future.
Moving to segment results, Q1 products and systems integration sales were $993 million, down $76 million or 7% driven by a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, partially offset by strong growth in Video Security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $5 million.
Operating earnings were $123 million or 12.4% of sales, down 140 basis points from last year due to the lower revenue. Notable Q1 wins in the segment include a $28 million Video Security award for a large utility customer in North America, of which $10 million was recognized as revenue in Q1; over $50 million of sales into governments across the entire Video Security portfolio, a $13 million P25 order for Port of Los Angeles California; a $12 million P25 order for Dinwiddie County, Virginia and an $8 million TETRA order for Germany's Armed Forces.
Moving to Software & Services, revenue was $662 million up $74 million or 13% from last year, driven by growth in Command Center Software & Services. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $2 million. Operating earnings were $224 million or 33.8% of sales, up 520 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage.
Notable Q1s in the segment include an $8 million P25 multi-year service contract extension with Cleveland, Ohio; a $6 million P25 multi-year services contract in Latin America; a $4 million Command Center Software suite contract with Brampton, Ontario; and a $3 million Command Center Software suite contract with Ft. Wayne, Indiana.
Looking at regional results, during the quarter we restructured our operations to realize more operational efficiencies combining EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America into one region, which is now reflected as the International. Accordingly, we now report net sales in two regions; North America, which includes the United States and Canada, and International.
North America Q1 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 4% driven by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software & Services, partially offset by a decline in professional and commercial radio. International Q1 revenue was $539 million, down 7% due to a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, primarily in Asia Pac.
Moving to backlog, ending backlog was $10.4 billion, up $48 million compared to last year, inclusive of $462 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $821 million due to $407 million of unfavorable currency rate, revenue recognition of the Airwave and ESN contract and typical North America order seasonality.
Software & Services backlog was up $120 million or 2% compared to last year due to growth in North America multi-year agreements, partially offset by $423 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $604 million, primarily due to $368 million of unfavorable currency rate and revenue recognition for ESN and Airwave.
Product and SI segment backlog was down $72 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $39 million of unfavorable currency rate. A decline in international backlog was partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $217 million, driven primarily by typical North America order seasonality.
Turning to our outlook, we expect Q2 sales to be down between 17% and 14%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.18 and $1.27. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of between 24% and 25%.
I’d now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks Gino. I thought I would end with a few high level comments regarding the full year impact COVID-19 is having on our business and how we're responding.
First, while this pandemic has disrupted and delayed our engagements with some customers and will have an impact on certain parts of our business, we remain fully committed to continue investing in our growth businesses. In Command Center Software we are accelerating our development to move to the cloud and recently launched our first cloud enabled CAD customer. We also expect our records in CAD solutions to be fully cloud enabled by the end of this year with our 911 software to follow in 2021.
In the Video Security business I'm very pleased with the continued traction with our enterprise and government customers, and will continue to invest in our H5 camera line, analytics, cloud based VMS solutions and features that integrate video and land mobile radio, while also expanding our sales coverage. Additionally, our durable cash flow generation and strong balance sheet put us in a unique position to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions going forward.
Second, while this is a critical time to continue to invest, we're also taking actions in a number of other areas to reduce our operating expenses. We now expect operating expenses to be down approximately $210 million versus 2019, which is a $150 million more than the annual decrease we discussed on our last earnings call. This additional reduction driven by lower to variable compensation, lower discretionary spend in areas such as travel and contractors and third party expenses and a reduction in real-estate should allow us to slightly expand operating margins for this year.
And finally, Motorola Solutions has been providing mission critical solutions to customers on the front line for over 90 years, and have managed through a number of crises, and I couldn't be more proud of how our people have responded to this one. Whether it's our Airwaves team enabling network coverage for temporary hospitals being built in the U.K. or our team helping the customer move their 911 command center operations to a back-up location in days, where one of their employees tested positive for COVID, our teams are going to great lengths to make sure our customers mission critical needs are met.
We entered this pandemic in a very secure position and I absolutely believe that we’ll emerge an even stronger company on the other side of it.
And now, let me turn this call back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. Before I begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible.
Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you. Yeah, maybe just for the two of them. First – maybe the quick one first. When thinking about kind of the whole in revenues in Q2 versus kind of what was probably originally expected, Gino can you help pass out how much of that is TCR related and how much is public safety?
And then Greg, if you could just talk a little bit about the public safety market. It seems like overall the company's being impacted more than prior, you know macro events in the world. So could you talk a little bit about what's different? What do you think is driving the change to the public safety market other than just logistics? Do you see any other fundamental changes here given the macro backdrop? Thank you. Hi Jim, this is Gino. On the first part of the question, clearly we've seen pressure in Professional and Commercial Radio. Certain verticals have been significantly impacted. You can think about hospitality, transportation, specifically airlines, oil and gas, manufacturing related to the pandemic and the shutdown for shelter-in-place orders.
We have seen some impact to public safety as our engagements have been delayed, both in terms of site work, but also in terms of being able to talk to customers. Obviously our customers are on the front lines of dealing with a pandemic and there's certainly been a delay in that engagement and the ability to talk to our customers really frankly beginning in mid-March, lasting through April and certainly in larger markets through May.
And it’s also important to note that embedded in that guidance, we continue to expect Command Center and Video Security – Command Center Software and Video Security to grow in Q2. But that dimensionally, PCR, certain verticals very much impacted, public safety characterized as a move to the right, based on as you said, logistics and inability to get in front of people and get to sites. Yeah, and Tim I would add that even though things have been pushed to the right, you know we're a different company now than we were several years ago. The good news is, you know we still expect Software & Services to grow this year. It could grow mid-single digits, we'll see, but we still expect that to grow. We do expect Video Security to grow, Command Center Software as part of Software & Services and I actually think – look, I think the severity of Q2 isn't so much as things have changed in public safety. I actually don't think they have. I think they've been pushed.
Two or three weeks in March we effectively became locked down in major locations domestically here in the states. That lockdown has continued in May, as well as April. So I think when you look at Q2 and see the sharpness of that decline, it's really things pushing to the right than any structural or behavioral patterns to the changing in public safety. What we do is still a need-to-do versus a nice-to-do, but obviously the situation is pretty extensive given that it’s a combination of a public health crisis, as well as a dramatic economic decline in 180-plus countries all at once. So hence I think our prudent approach at this point in time.
I think the product segment for the full year will be down as things push to the right. It could be down low double digits; again, we'll have to see. But I think with resilient backlog and an overall strength of our position with 75% -- about 75% of our business is public safety and government and 25% enterprise, I still think we're well positioned. Thank you, Greg. Yeah, sure Tim. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay thanks, good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start, kind of going back to the last financial crisis. I know that the business is different, but if you look at the like-to-like basis, during that time revenue for the full year was down somewhere around the mid-single digit range. Do you remember what it was on kind of a max-thing on a quarterly basis? Is there any similarity to sort of the mid-teen decline that you’re seeing in Q2. And also, maybe how quickly did it recover and what could be similar or different this time around versus that? Yeah, I think the difference is again in – unlike last time where we had the financial Great Recession and things recovered, what we've experienced here is a little bit like the market seizing up, literally. We couldn't get in front of customers, many customers on the sales side from an engagement standpoint and even on services and implementations, deployments, we are pushed out as well.
I think we're much better position this time. Software & Services is a little bit more than a third of our business, most of that largely recurring long term contracts, mission critical in nature. If I rewind the tape last time, that was 20% or sub 20% of our overall revenue.
The other thing is, even though we’re having a difficult Q2, and Jack could comment on this, but we're seeing the funnel. Even though projects get pushed to the right, we've actually just over the last few weeks and months seen a constant replenishment of projects coming in too. So we just thought given the fog and uncertainty and the uniqueness of this thing, in a once and literally a century pandemic. It was kind of prudent for us to suspend full year guidance at this time.
But I think we are much better positioned. I think we still expect growth in video, we still expect growth in Command Center Software. The professional and commercial radio business, which is think of the radio business for commercial, has been hit hard serving verticals like hospitality, transportation, airline, gaming and some of the things that have been hit particularly hard.
Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. Yeah, maybe just a couple of things. As we look around the globe, things are starting to open up in certain countries in Asia Pac who was frankly hit first. So there's potentially some signs of encouragement there in terms of reengaging with customers, customers focus moving back to technology projects.
The second thing that I think that all of us feel pretty proud of is the team, their ability to continuously staying engage virtually with the customers by way of video, conference mechanisms, but also we held a video, a virtual trade show for our Video Security and Analytics Business, because an industry was canceled in March and we actually had – we had over 30% more people that actually attended our virtual conference than would have attended the conference in person, and literally had chat rooms, questions and everything from access control, school safety, and so we're encouraged by a lot of those things.
We actually even see here into April, certain states engagements starting to improve and so it’s just one of things. Obviously the pandemic has taken the focus of our customers and we'll continue to work with them in any way we can to support them. Okay, that's helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up. In your commentary on COVID-19 impact, you talked about delayed engagement, deployments with state local customers near term, which may impact future revenue, and maybe Greg and Jack can provide some color on that statement? More specifically, they are finding that customers are now evaluating other options because there is a fear that, ‘hey, you know we’ve long been worried about the potential cannibalization of LTE and broadband.’ Is that a way to save money? Are customers evaluating that in a bigger way and is this kind of the catalyst to finally see that shift happen in a bigger way. No, I don't think; in fact we see the opposite of that. During this time we see the importance and criticality of land, mobile, radio versus any alleged migration or shift to LTE. I think LTE is complementary; it's a data broadband network that's an extension of LMR. Actually our APX NEXT product that integrates broadband with land, mobile, radio is best positioned to take advantage of that.
I know that there's been some speculation or commentary that suggests that LTE is starting to cannibalize. We see no – absolutely no indication of that, and if anything maybe the opposite.
So, just maybe one thing to add to that. Obviously we see that we have an LTE, a public safety LTE device in the LEX11, but more importantly as Greg said, we have a collaborative device in terms of APX NEXT; it does P25 obviously. And the focus here is and what we’ve seen in the pandemic and the response with public safety is fundamental when someone calls 911, there is a multitude of things that happened, but that puts our technology in place, and there’s been more strain on the networks, which really is evidence to the fact of why you need a purpose built network?
But a really good example was a major – without getting into specifics, a major city health department, procured APX NEXT devices because they needed to talk to the front line fire and EMS people, but also wanted that backup capability when they left the city and it was a big health department. There was really traditionally a secondary type customer for Motorola that bought obviously high tier equipment in terms of APX NEXT.
So this thing has really been – a lot of what we're seeing in Q2 has really been the ability to not get to physical sites, to not engage physically with customers and I think that's really the challenge and we view that as being kind of a short term challenge. Understood. Thanks for the color. Stay safe. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi guys, thanks very much. I guess just as a follow-on to that thought, you know you mentioned it's an issue around customer engagement, but what about budgets? Obviously states are going through budgeting cycles at this point. I think certainly tax receipts are going to be down, municipalities and counties you know a similar situation. So do you see sort of an economic kind of fall out of lower tax receipts or do you think the LMR businesses is more immune to that? Thanks. So hey George, it’s Jack. A couple things. I think it's always important – we see there's been a lot written, a lot discussed around state and local budgets. I think it's very important to decompose what those budgets mean. The reality of state and local budgets, there's a confluence of probably five to six different funding streams: federal transfer dollars, federal grant dollars, property tax, income tax, sales tax in some states, but also 911 funding, which is one of the real reasons why we've made a lot of acquisitions in the command center space, because part and parcel, that's a different funding streams that’s essentially protected.
So it's a number of those things, but I go back to – you know one of the benefits we have of being a company that's close to 95 years old is we've gone through a number of these things after 911 and they're all a little different, the Great Recession. But what we've seen and when we've gone back and looked at the data, it suggests that public safety gets prioritized in these things. There's other things around the margins that may get delayed, may get deferred, all those kind of things, but at the end of the day when – we've even seen it as evidence in this response to the pandemic, you need to have the best technology in the hands of those first responders. We think that gets protected.
There's always – by the way the budget situations in state and local haven't been easy for the last number of years. I think that's lastly where our sales team, as much as they have relationships and everything, we’ve got a very veteran team out there that's very focused at working with our customers to navigate funding plans and they are really holistic plans that they work with our customer base.
So I think we’ll come out of this with the same level of priority that public safety has always gotten, if not more George, so I think that answers your question. Got it, great! And then I'll just ask one more. The NG9-1-1 opportunity seems more interesting these days. I mean there's obviously a stimulus package that’s brewing here coming from Congress administration, and I know in pass drafts there's been I think $12 billion plus in funds that were earmarked for NG9-1-1 upgrades and I'm not sure what this current package is going to look like. But does that – do you see that as an opportunity for Motorola Solutions and how much of that, you know those dollars you think could trickle down to the stuff that you guys do? Hey George, it's Kelly. Absolutely, we do see that as an opportunity for us, not just in the in NG9-1-1, which is a refresh of the backbone associated with the 911 call center to help turn it into more of a broadband backbone, but it's also – there's been a lot of interest and related to cloud as a result of this pandemic, where a lot of our customers in the past have been operating with their equipment on an on-prem basis where they operate it there. The need to be able to operate it remotely is something that's definitely been introduced as part of this pandemic.
The good news is we've already been investing in cloud and a good portion of our software was already cloud enabled. But as you heard Greg mention in our remarks, we're accelerating our investments even more in cloud based on the demand we see now. We just launched our first CAD customer in the cloud. By the end of this year our CAD, our records portfolio will be completely cloud enabled and in early next year we’ll be – our 911 efforts will all be cloud enabled as well.
So it does definitely drive that and yes, we do see some of those dollars starting to flow through as folks prioritize not just NG9-1-1, but the rest of the command center software refresh. Okay, thanks. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Hi, this is [Inaudible] filling in for Keith. L3Harris’s CEO recently said that LMR sales could decline by 10% this year. Do you agree with that market assessment? Well, I think that – I think our view is reflected in the commentary that we gave. They are a much smaller player in the business. I think we have much more extensive installed base and contacts and annuity revenues, but as I mentioned, you know Q2 is very unique, because as Malloy pointed out, just that this year’s logistical difficulty of customer engagement and deployment.
But do I think product revenues are likely to decline? Yes, and I think they will be on a decline that will be comparable to what we saw in the land, mobile, radio business actually in ‘09. But again, that's more about delayed and deferred demand, than any demand that's actually lost or goes away and I think it will recover and I think public safety is demonstrated over the last several years and longer. It remains at the top of the food chain.
So I think they have a certain view of the market, that's their opinion, but I would maintain that I think we have a very long standing and more thorough and comprehensive perspective. Great! Thank you very much. Just one additional item on that note. It's also important to note the composition of the business and as Greg mentioned earlier, the percentage of our business that's commercially, that’s earmarked for commercial customers. The PCR business specifically and that's where we're seeing the pressure more specifically is around PCR, not around necessarily the public safety to the degree that we're seeing in the PCR marketplace. Thanks. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks, I appreciate it. Can you all hear me okay? Yeah, yeah. Okay. If I return to the PCR business, I know you don't normally break it out. Given that you've got a business with particular exposure, I’d assume particularly heavy exposure to those sectors that have been absolutely devastated; hospitality, energy, etcetera, the ones you listed. Can you give us a sense for what percentage of revenue comes from those particular sectors? Yeah, Paul the professional and commercial radio last year, again as Gino referenced, I think land, mobile, radio for commercial and enterprise, last year all in with about $1 billion. So as we think about it this year, obviously that's the area that's come under the most pressure, and two-thirds of that is vertical served; airlines, retail, hospitality, oil and gas that had been the most significantly impacted. So that's what's driving the more pronounced double digit decline in that area. Given the nature of [inaudible], that's exactly what I would've expected, somewhere well north of 50%, so it's around two-thirds.
Second question, with respect to your comments about Asia Pac in particular, I recognize its not been uniform in Asia Pac; at least I don’t see it’s been uniform in terms of the timing of the impact of COVID and the shutdown. But it hit China first and now we’re seeing Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, etcetera.
So my question is, is there any insight you can gain in terms of seeing the sequencing, in terms of things having gone cold turkey and coming back. I know it's very, very early. There's not a lot of visibility I trust anywhere, but is there anything you can take away from that timing and sequencing of events and just as it relates to your North American business and your worldwide business? Yeah, so Paul I think when you look at Asia Pac, to your point it’s essentially pretty sporadic. Things within country, you can't get in there from out, but our biggest country in Asia Pac is Australia. Things are – I'd say they're slightly ahead of where certain states that have started to re-open are here, with a lot of the same precautions and measures that have been set up. It's just really early to kind of tell to be honest with you.
But I will tell you, you know one of the things that we look at is our – you know we haven't really talked about it, but our video security and analytics business, in the states that have opened up, we've seen engagement even within North America improve there. So it's – there's not a whole lot we can glean. You look at parts of the Middle East to buy, those places are starting to open up a little bit as well, but it's what I would call very cautious opening up. I appreciate that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Good evening everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to begin – could you start by discussing a little bit about how you think of your sales cycle duration as you reengage customers. You think there's any change in the kind of the traditional period of those awards? Just any high level thoughts on you know where you think customers had their outage, you're starting to have those discussions and your ability to close new business, and I have a follow up. Okay Ben, so I dimensionalize our business. It's not – all things are not the same. There's big projects and then there's an amount of what you call kind of term agreement and grass roots business, that by the way has continued to an extent to continue to flow.
Large projects typically go through – you get a request for proposal and that's a timeline, but then you have elements where they have to go through board approval, city council approvals, state procurement approvals and the like to use that example and really what Gino and what Greg have referenced, is a lot of those meetings have been delayed.
So there's not an issue that we have to go resell, re-canvas if you will. It's really just the procedural milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones of a project and just extend them out you know into the second half and those kind of things. That's been the issue, it hasn't ended.
The good news is, with video technology and those kind of things, we've been able to stay engaged with our customers, answer questions and all those kind of things, but it's really just a milestone type thing where we’ve seen the delays. And as we’ve talked about you know the physical access to get not only at sites, but in the Command Center and those kind of things as well. If we've got to go do work with those people there, there's been some delays as it relates to those things as well. Thanks for that. Jack, you also earlier commented on the diversity in the funding sources. Outside of the 911 funding, when you look at the federal transfer tax, federal grants, property and income taxes, just stepping back, I mean those four pieces don't seem to be in a very good position looking forward. So I'm not looking for guidance, but I'm interested in how you're thinking about the absolute budget opportunity coming from the public sector customers into the future; just that aggregate bucket of opportunity. How you're thinking that developed over time or any specific feedback you're getting from customers? Thank you. Yes, so I'd start with – listen, if we were selling and I don't want to – if we were selling something that that they would deem is non-critical, non-essential to their work flow communications, I'd maybe be a little bit concerned. But I think the fact that you're selling mission critical communications, you are at the very top of the priority chain, that's a good thing.
But it's interesting. If you look at it, a lot of our customers feel like property taxes, you know a lot of these things. If there is a recovery gets a little bit sharper, they may not have the impact that we had. Obviously there's been a pretty significant impact as it relates to sales tax, but remember, most of our things are things that they've been planned for multiple years, their technology upgrades, expansions and those kind of things related to mission critical and we’ve kind of went through this before, went through this a little bit after 911; certainly felt this.
You know I was pretty close to the customer back in 2009 and navigated a team in the central United States that was probably hit frankly from a budget perspective harder than everybody and we saw some things delayed. We had some additional questions to answer, but every deal that we had at that point in time continued to move forward and I think I look at that as encouraging as we move through this pandemic. Thanks guys. Best of luck in Q2 and the rest of the year. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. The sequential decline that you're looking for from a geographic perspective, is it sort of uniform across geographies? Yeah, so Paul I think it is. If you look at it, because of the broad spread nature when we do business, Greg has said it hit 180 countries; there’s 120 of those that we do business. In general if you look at it on the surface, it's essentially had an equal weighting and I think the reason for that is because it hasn't – the opportunities have just gone away.
It's been that we've had some of the same limits, physically engaging with customers, going to sites and physically deploying systems and those kind of things. There has been essentially equal opportunity, delays as it's related to those things. So I'd say in general, it's been felt largely equally around the globe. Just want to go back to the sort of budget contention question for a moment. It seems to me from a public safety perspective, things have shifted dramatically and they are going to be around for a while now, and the biggest shift of courses is towards testing and then administration of public health systems and that's going to be data intensive. And it just seems like that's where the dollars are going to be going in the future, but you feel like that doesn't contend with your budgets. If you could just comment upon that.
And then in passing, also does the opportunity present itself to Motorola as well. I mean can you, participate in what seems like a very big initiative over the next couple of years. So, Paul it's a great question, and one that frankly has us. If there's a lot of things that we – this has been certainly a struggle in the last couple of months for most companies, but it really delights us in the fact that we've added substantially in terms of the Video Security and Analytics portfolio to the company.
Right now our teams are working on and will be – in May and June will be continuing to market Video Analytics Solutions around social distancing, around mask compliance and detection in campuses, in manufacturing facilities, in the public domain, fever scanning technology, as well as contact tracing. So analytics that will essentially tell you if you think about a lot of the dialogue around getting return to campuses, returned-to-schools and the like.
Our access control solutions will be able to monitor and tell you if somebody was sick, who went through that door at that school, who might likely have come in contact with someone who is sick.
So as much as we'll see, maybe a change or a moderation of a different type of opportunities. Our Video Security and Analytic space put a spot on in that. I also think the move in Kelly and his team have done a great job, moving the Command Center to the cloud, but if you look at our vigilant cloud services business, this has been I think – we’ve moved 35,000 cameras to the cloud so far this year.
So I think with every challenge comes an opportunity and the Video Security Analytics Business is one that I think has an opportunity to benefit from this. You don’t see the contention that I talked about. I mean I see the opportunity for you, but not – but you are not even seeing the contention for scarce resources there, the tension between public safety as expressed though healthcare versus public safety through LMR first responder systems. If you talk to a paramedic, a police officer or a firemen, they tell you the most important piece of equipment that they have, that they've always had and this is a millennial firemen or it’s a fireman's who has been on the job for 30 years, the single most important communication and the lifeline that they have is a two way radio. We don't see that changing. Our customers are telling us they don't see that changing. Got it, thanks. Our next question comes from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead. Thanks. I assume that the next quarter's guidance basically just assumes that the current state of affairs extends until the end of June, you're not expecting any recovery. Just kind of the thought process on that, because obviously you’ve had some states opening up, you had some Airlines talking about seeing increased bookings, you had competitive companies talk about return to growth, Verizon talked about – while consumer was down, some of their larger enterprise or public safety clients were stronger than ever. So I’m just curious about kind of what the guidance for Q2 implies and how far to the right I guess you could realistically think it can be, given some of these data point already exist now and in early May. Yeah, I think that well, it largely reflects and is driven by as Gino mentioned, the professional and commercial radio segment itself. So radio for corporate verticals, that's the most accentuated pressure point on Q2.
The second is the engagement and deployment, and again, it was the second half of March, April and largely a lot of May as well, and we just thought if we're going to guide Q2, let’s do it in a responsible prudent way and move forward accordingly. But that, it's really… So it’s just the PCR that you're involved with, because the PCR that other companies are involved with, I'm not sure I’ve seen that type of dramatic move. So is it just that when you talk about airlines and things like that, that’s it’s just these specific things, because your products are addressing customers that are dealing with large crowds, that it's more specific to you guys as a result.
And then, I guess it's hard for any of us to figure out when those types of businesses are going to come back if at all right. I mean some of these customers theoretically could just go away right. Yeah. Well, maybe if I could. So the PCR if you think about it, I think you talked about Verizon. The traditional PCR, if you think about it from a competitive set, it's companies like Kenwood, like Hytera, ICOM, a number of the those type of people, and so I think they've – without a doubt they felt the same thing. And again, those are private systems dedicated towards a refinery, an airline, The Marriott Hotel and those kind of things, and I think that industry has equally felt it, because there’s a physical element of design and deployment of a system as well.
Verizon's a lot different. You could go and pick up at a kiosk, you could have a phone delivered and you can pick it up. So I wouldn't see the same sort of physical – you know the delay if you will that we would see in our business, so I think that's really what… [Cross Talk]. Yeah, I was referring only to Verizon. I mean, Ericsson, Axon, Ciena, CommScope, Adtran, I mean there’s – obviously there's more than just Verizon at the data point. But it seems like some of these customers you just mentioned like airlines and some of these, again customers that rely a large crowds, it might be more specific, right. So again, are you worried that maybe those customers don't push to the right, but they just never kind of return at all because of the state of how people are going to return to large crowd as opposed to not? I think it would be a small portion of it. I mean you know the example is, if an airline goes out of business, well that's one airline that won't need a radio system. But as we look at it, it's relatively – we view that to be a relatively small subset of the customers, frankly. Okay, but it's enough that it's driving the revenue down not much in Q2. Because I thought you said the public safety was doing well, and it was just that – it was this segment that was doing poorly and that was enough to take guidance down by 15 – excuse me, your revenue growth down by 15%. Yeah well, I think what we're trying to say is that Q2 is a timing issue, not an evaporation issue. And its acute negative 14 to negative 17, but it's not evaporating. It's going to the right and there might be some that evaporates, but we think it's a pretty small percentage. It’s really representative of things being pushed to the right in that Professional Commercial Radio category. Awesome! So if I see like – for example if JetBlue sees their numbers and we see those numbers go up, and Marriott, we see their numbers go up, they should be indicated that that business could then come back next quarter, not June quarter but the September, is that fair? Walt, that’s exactly right, and look, I can't speak to the exact timing of quarterly alignment. I don't know if we’re that precise, but you are right that as airlines recover, people start to fly again, people go to Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, the states and the economies and commerce reopen, because does that business and the acute pressure downward start to improve, yes it will improve. Got it. Thanks Greg, that’s helpful. Yeah, no problem Walt. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Thank you, Greg and you know I've known you for over a decade of time and we’ve both been through a lot of cycles. You correctly talked about you know so much of the puts and takes.
My question, since a lot of the questions already have been answered is more on the top of the ladder so to speak or when you talk about Motorola Solutions will give its fair piece of the pie or even bigger than its fair piece of pie. Is that pie for top of the ladder currently structurally compressed or compressed for like maybe six to 12 months, you know just due to less inflows of you mentioned five to six inflows of state and local budgets. I’m more focused on the state and local budget balancing opportunities and what your experience has been in that? Thank you. Well, I think what I would say is this. Obviously this is a situation that I don't think any of us have seen before. We've had 9/11; we've had dot-com collapse; we've had the Lehman Brothers Great Recession. This one is different and that it's 187 countries and it's a compilation of both the public health crisis and an act of severe economic downturn at once and they're intertwined.
So if I take a step back and think about, are we in the right businesses? Do we have brand equity? Do we have strength in incumbency? Do we have a greater percentage of recurring revenues in software and services? And I look at Command Center Software that will continue to grow, we believe it should grow this year even in the face of this.
Video security and analytics, we expect to grow even in the face of this. Software and services, we would expect and still could grow around mid-single digits even in the face of this, and the incumbent footprint and strength that we have in our installed base of 13,000 land, mobile, radio networks worldwide, with probably our strongest anchor tenant position being North America.
Is that a good business to be in? We absolutely believe that. We’ll monetize services, we’ll move upstream, by the way we’ll integrate these as well. We’ll integrate video security with integrated land, mobile, radio networks as an anchor tenant conveyor of communications and critical information in this addressable market, and we zero out China, forget China. It is a $40 billion addressable market.
Is it temporarily dislocated? Obviously the answer is yes, and that's reflected in the Q2 guide. We always guide. I've never in my career not guided for a full year, this is the first. We just think it was a prudent thing to do. There's a lot of variables and things that are moving around, but it doesn't change the fundamental strength, attributes, longevity and advantages that our brand and our market position and the technologies we play, we can capitalize on, which is also why we are going to continue to invest organically.
Sales coverage, video security, command center software to the cloud, hearing a different – and newer radios that you'll see later this year and next year and we're going to continue to invest inorganically, and I think this is an opportunity to prioritize capital deployment around acquisitions of assets that they're having temporary dislocation, that may make sense for us accretively to fold into Motorola Solutions.
So there's no doubt it's a tough environment, but I really believe and I think our team does too, that this is an opportunity to invest and lean in responsibly, take down the breakeven and take out $210 million of OpEx and position the firm even stronger to come out of the other end in 2021 and beyond, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Great! And my quick follow up is, other companies are kind of called off M&A, simply because you can't meet in person, you can't walk their floors and factories. It sounds like from your comment you just gave me now that M&A is actually very, very interesting to you and you're still going to go forward as planned. Is that correct or it maybe you go forward as planned and it just takes a little bit longer. I would say it's going forward. It may take a little bit longer, but there's a couple of opportunities the we're engaged with now, and that dialogue has begun, we'll see. Most of them don't pan out, but I don't see and right now Jim, as we’re in the middle of May, this is another area that I feel is kind of reopening if you will. I don't see conversations in this regard being encumbered that will delay any plans or opportunities that come our way. Thank you, so much for the detail. It’s greatly appreciated. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi! Thank you very much for the question. My question mainly has to with Avigilon and the video surveillance business, and you've guided to a slight growth or some growth in 2020 for video, but I was hoping you’ll tell us what video and what Avigilon grew in 1Q, 2020 and where really we should be thinking about the growth rate, just because the growth rate is coming from the mid-teens growth rates in 2019 and we just want to get a better sense on how to model that for 2020. So obviously Q2 as Greg, Gino, as we pointed out, there's been some limitations in terms of just ability to meet and some of those no customer engagements, you know that's been the issue for Q2. But I would tell you Sami, looking at Q1, where we were coming out of the end of March in Q1, it was the best quarter we've had with Avigilon. Frankly we had talked about growing three times the market. We're taking more share. Particularly in North America the team has done an outstanding job. We've made significant investments in go-to-market, even greater investments in research and development.
I spoke to some of the interesting things we are working on and pandemic response earlier. We’ve got a completely new line of H5 cameras, software analytic investments we've made, that's not even to include what we've invested in in public safety and WatchGuard, the acquisition of WatchGuard and VaaS and we’re doing there. So we actually – we expect the businesses, assuming return to normal, sometime in the third quarter, we expect to get back to those growth rate levels if not greater. Got it, got it. And then I just had a follow-up on Command Center, and there was a big uptick that you guys have called out. You’ve addressed it and a big thing, and you are pointing the growth for the full year. The one thing I really wanted to know is, when it comes to the Command Center suite, do you have existing customers buying more modules within the Command Center?
Is that what the big uptick was or is it just those customers that needed the Command Center suite in the first place and then they just happened to execute that in 1Q, 2020, and you're going to see more new customers come in for the rest of the year versus the existing customers buying in more modules. I just want to understand kind of like what the motion is within Command Center? So Sami, its Kelly. It's a combination of both. Actually in the first quarter we actually picked up a number of new customers. Frankly more new customers than suite customers, which is great, because that gives us the opportunity to land and expand those customers and grow the platform in the width and the depth of what we provide to them.
We are still seeing also though many of our customers are still moving and we are expanding and adding more modules of the Command Center Suite. As you probably recall, as I’ve said the past, folks don’t walk in and buy typically all the components at one time, simply because of the risk profile of a Command Center and a 911 Center. They will schedule and they will do 911 one year, CAD the next year, Record the next year, and the thing that we watch is how we're doing regards to penetrating across those positions and we are still seeing good progress on that.
So I don’t know if you have a follow-up on that, but that's pretty much how we look at the Command Center, that’s the performance and why we saw the growth we did in Q1. Perfect! Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Tim Yocum for any closing remarks. No additional comments.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join the Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we’ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I’ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before our CFO, Jason Winkler, takes us through our Q2 results and outlook.
First, I'm proud of our focus and execution in the second quarter, as we dealt with the challenges from COVID-19. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our expectations, generated $209 million of operating cash flow and continued to grow in our Video Security, Command Center Software and Services businesses.
Additionally, we closed the acquisition of IndigoVision in earlier this week, announced the acquisition of Pelco, investments which further strengthen our position as a global leader in Video Security.
Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew 5% and the expanded operating margins by 260 basis points. We also won several new multiyear software and services contracts, highlighted by $26 million Next-Gen 911 nine contract with the state of Utah.
And finally, I'm inspired by how our employees across the business continue to find ways to engage with customers, to sell, deploy, and support their solutions. And while the COVID-19 environment remains fluid, I am encouraged by the customer activity we've seen, particularly over the past several weeks.
Now, before turning it over to Jason, I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Gino Bonanotte for his 33 years of outstanding service at Motorola. One of Gino's many accomplishments was developing a world-class finance organization. And Jason is a great example of our strong bench, as well as our succession planning.
Jason's operational finance experience across Motorola for almost 20 years and almost -- and most recently leadership of our largest segment, including Video Security, uniquely qualifies him as Gino's successor. I personally have worked closely with Jason for just under 10 years, and several of you may recall him from when he was in Investor Relations a few years back.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q2 results included revenue of $1.6 billion, down 13% from a year ago, including $40 million of revenue from acquisitions and $30 million of currency headwinds. GAAP operating earnings of $218 million and operating margins of 13.5% compared to 18.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $359 million, down $85 million, and non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, down from 23.9% in the year ago quarter, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services.
GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 per share compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 versus $169 last year, primarily due to lower sales in products, partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services. OpEx in Q2 was $426 million, down $68 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives, partially offset by costs from acquisitions. Q2 effective tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in the prior year, a change driven primarily due to higher R&D tax credits in this year.
Turning the cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $209 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $155 million compared with $188 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales and net income, partially offset by improvements in working capital. For the first half, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up year-over-year, primarily driven by an improved working capital.
Capital allocation for Q2 included $109 million in cash dividends, $83 million of share repurchases, $65 million for acquisitions, and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, we've repaid $500 million of the $800 million we borrowed in Q1 under the revolving credit facility, which was in response to COVID-19. $300 million of this was paid during Q2 and $200 million has been paid subsequent to the quarter-end, bringing the current outstanding amount to $300 million.
Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $968 million, down 22% driven by a decline in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR. The decline in the segment was primarily delayed sales engagement and deployments primarily caused by COVID-19. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and the currency headwinds were $10 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 13.5% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year, primarily driven by lower sales.
Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment included a $24 million P25 order for the state of Alaska, a $20 million P25 order for Newton County, Georgia and a $17 million P25 order for the state of South Dakota. We also launched the WatchGuard V300 continuous operation body worn camera, the first in the industry to address law enforcement's need for cameras that remain operational beyond a 12-hour shift. We closed on the acquisition of IndigoVision, and this week announced the Pelco transaction, both important assets as we expand our video security solutions.
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Revenue was $650 million, up 5% from last year driven by growth in North America Services and Software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and currency headwinds were $20 million. Operating earnings were $228 million or 35.1% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include a $37 million P25 multiyear services contract with the state of Louisiana, a $10 million statewide multiyear services contract in North America, an $8 million multiyear computer aided dispatch contract with Baltimore County, and a $26 million Next-Gen 911 services contract with the state of Utah. Next-Gen 911 is a growing part of our business that provides enhanced database infrastructure, enabling multimedia content for 911 systems.
Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.1 billion, down 13% due to declines in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software and Services. International Q2 revenue was $525 million, down 14% primarily due to a decline in professional and commercial radio and unfavorable FX.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.5 billion, down $376 million compared to last year, inclusive of $126 million of unfavorable currency rates, driven further by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and a few other international deployments, partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was up $68 million, inclusive of $253 million of favorable currency rates.
Software and Services backlog was down $148 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $116 million of unfavorable currency rates, revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and partially offset by growth in North America multiyear agreements. Sequentially backlog was up $161 million or 2%, inclusive of $225 million of favorable currency rates.
Products and SI segment backlog was down $228 million or 7% compared to last year, inclusive of $10 million of unfavorable currency, due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying sales engagements. Sequentially backlog was down $93 million or 3%, inclusive of $27 million of favorable currency rates, driven primarily by COVID-19 delaying sales engagements.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be down between 9% and 8%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.72 and $1.78 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.
For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 7%, with non-GAAP EPS between $7.40 and $7.52. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at the current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. Additionally, we still expect to realize the $210 million of year-over-year OpEx reductions that we communicated on our last call. The acquisition of Pelco as an incremental $30 million of OpEx for the balance of the year, resulting in a net reduction of $180 million inclusive of Pelco. And for our operating cash flow, it is expected to be $1.5 billion for the year.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our momentum is strong in Software and Services. In Command Center Software, we won numerous multiyear awards during the quarter, highlighted by our Next-Generation 911 order from the state of Utah. Additionally, we're seeing an increase in engagements for our cloud based solutions as more public safety agencies recognize the benefits that these solutions can provide. We launched our CAD and records products in the cloud during the second quarter and have sold it to a number of customers already.
In our services business, the support we've provided to our LMR customers during the pandemic has further validated the criticality of private secure mission critical networks. We continue to see customers investing in these networks for the long-term.
Second, in our Product segment where we clearly felt the impact from COVID-19 during Q2, as many of our customers experienced disruptions, I've been encouraged by the increase in activity we've seen particularly over the past several weeks with our customers. We are expecting improvement in the second half of the year, as economies open up and public safety customers, reengage.
In our Video Security business, demand remains strong and we continue to expect growth for the year. We're investing in the portfolio to provide AI powered solutions with analytics that keep people and communities safe. And we've expanded our global footprint with the recent acquisitions of IndigoVision and Pelco.
And finally, as I look to the second half of 2020, we expect business conditions to gradually improve from the low point in Q2. Our portfolio of solutions across LMR, video, and command center software, together with the services we provide, are as critical as ever. Engagements with our customers and the corresponding pipeline have increased sequentially. And our balance sheet and free cash flow generation remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in the deployment of capital.
I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callars to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind callars on the line how to ask a question? [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Our first question is from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you. Maybe -- I got one for you Greg, and then when we're done, I have a follow-up for Jason. Greg, you talked about some encouraging conversations recently, I would love to get more color there, particularly in the context of state and local government budgets and how you're seeing that? And what kind of impact do you see the rest of the year, and any more color that would be great. Thank you. Yeah. I think that things have gradually are improving. It's incremental, but from the low point, Tim, in April and May was tough as well. June is better in July, has performed within kind of the context of our expectations. I think that as customers reengage among other things, there's obviously heightened interest around video, particularly body worn video. There's interest in cloud and cloud engagement, given more and more people having to work from home and a few of our customers that are having public safety systems and major deployments. Some may not be fully encrypted. And given the congregation of large numbers of people in the cities, some of these customers have reached out in an effort to have us work with them to accelerate their public safety systems to encrypt them and be more secure. Those are three themes.
I think the other thing I would say is we've done a pretty good job. I think the Lloyd's team has done a great job and Kelly's team on learning how to engage customers remotely and move some procurements along. I also think that the pipeline is beginning to see some gradual improvement, which is positive as well.
And I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jack. Yeah. I think, you said Greg. State local, we're full on reengaged with customers face-to-face in North America, but maybe just a few stats to put meat on the bones. Our marketing call center inquiries in Q2 were up 15%, quotes for body worn were up close to 50% and in car and body worn requests for quotes were up over a 100%. So, just to kind of quantify some of the things that Greg spoke about. Okay. That's great. Jason welcome since your first one, I'll throw one to you. Obviously, great performance in the margins on Software and Services. Could you talk a little bit about kind of sustainability and as that business scales, and there's more bundle sales and software and things like that. Is there still room for upside to that line? And what would drive that? Thank you. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Tim. First, we were pleased with the growth of 5% in the segment for the quarter, and it did drive higher gross margins complemented by lower operating expenses and leverage. So, I'm pleased with the performance there. I think the team led by Kelly continues to execute well. And we'll continue to expect growth from that business as well as continue to expect operating margins this year around 34%. Okay. Thank you. Our next question today will come from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start -- appreciate you bringing out full year guidance. And it looks like on 2020 on the EBITDA line, it actually might shape up similar or maybe a little bit better than 2008, 2009. And I just wanted to challenge that embedded in guidance is a Q4 upswing. And I just have two questions around that. First, on the revenue line, it's going to imply improvement year-over-year in that line. What gave you the confidence to go that far out? A couple quarters out, you have something on from orders or aged backlog that gave you the visibility to stick your neck out for Q4.
And then secondly, on the operating profit dollar line, it looks like operating profit dollars are going to be down less than revenue on a year-over-year basis. It plays a pretty big swing sequentially in Q4 on operating profit dollars. Why would that occur? Is there some cost cuts incremental or something like that that would make that operating profit dollar line inflect like that? Thank you. Yeah. So, first thing kind of let me contextualize the Q3 guide, obviously revenue down negative eight to negative nine, and then all-in, revenue down approximately 7% of for fiscal year 2020. Now, when I referenced second half improvement, I'm talking about improvement from the low point anchored in Q2, which was -- April was things pretty much seized up and May wasn't much better. So, the improvement is off of Q2, even contemplated in the guidance though. We're still -- while it's sequentially improving, we are not -- we don't anticipate growth in Q4 to get to the all-in negative 7% decline. So, we are not contemplating or anticipating Q4 standalone to return positively to growth. Although, we think it will sequentially improve from Q3.
You referenced kind of second half of this year versus the fiscal crisis in 2009, I would say here are the differences that I think about between those two periods. In many regards, this is worse, because COVID-19 is a public health prices, which has been contributed to the second most difficult economic situation since 2009. And it's global. It's not a North American phenomenon or U.S. phenomenon, it's in 188 countries. That's the bad news.
The good news is we're totally different company than we were in 2009. If we rewind the tape and think about what we were facing then, we still had -- we were in the cellphone business losing several hundred million a quarter. We were in the cellular wireless infrastructure business with single digit market share, sitting at number five or number six. And those businesses were structurally challenged.
Today, we are in mission critical public safety networks. We're in, what I would call, kind of central nervous system 911 command center software. And we're in all things video, fixed video, body worn video, dash-cam video, license plate recognition. So the portfolio of the firm is much more critical needs to have, the nice to have, and obviously we've been impacted by COVID-19, but that disruption has been more about a disruption than a decline in overall demand. The long-term drivers still remain pretty sound. And even in this difficult year, we still expect to grow in command center software. We expect to grow in video security. We expect to grow in land mobile radio services.
And when you look at the Software and Services segment -- and by the way, on the last call in May, I think I referenced Software and Services we thought could grow in the mid single digits. We now expect for full year 2020 Software and Services segment to grow more in the high single digits. The operating margin guidance of that segment we referenced last time was 33%. Jason just said a few minutes ago, we now expect all-in more like 34% operating margin for Software and Services. So, I certainly don't want to collectively put our neck out. I think, it's more reflection of the beginning progress we're seeing in the months of June and July.
And the last thing I would throw in is aged backlog, which you referenced actually is up slightly, both for Q3 from this position heading into Q3 and for the second half. And those ingredients are what informs our perspective for the full year. Okay. Thanks, Greg. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question will come from George Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to get back to the questions around public safety, LMR. There's a stimulus package obviously kind of potentially coming out of the U.S. House and Senate. And I guess, I'm just trying to think about how state and local governments are kind of parsing that. I mean, it may or may not include some backfill for budgets on state and local. If you think about your outlook over the second half of the year, I mean, are governments counting on any stimulus ? Or when you talk about the picture you have over the back half of the year, is it fair to say you're not expecting any stimulus as part of that picture? So, any help there would be great. Thanks. Yeah. I think first, the guidance we're giving you today contemplates kind of the state of play as it is today. We talked about public safety engagement being pushed to the right a bit in our inability to get with customers face-to-face. It also impacted some deployments. But I would characterize that again as is more of a disruption than a decline in demand.
Now, all-in, when we think about North America public safety, land mobile radio, all-in products and services, I think we contemplate approximately a decline of about 7% for North America public safety products and services all-in. So, that's kind of the way we think about it. Yeah. And maybe to piggyback off that, George, as you well know, implied in our guidance, we look at deals on a really a ground up basis. So, there were funded. We feel like we've guided prudently. I will say that any -- and really the CARES money, so some of the phase two CARES money has started to flow to the state/local governments. In fact, we were receipt of an order from a state in the Southeast, $20 million order in the Southeast of P25 upgrade just in the last few weeks. So, we'll see some of that, but it's all implied in what we see in the second half of the year.
In general, any additional monies may be beneficial. But what we see for the second half of the year is already funded. Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you for the question. Now that you've introduced your body worn camera, and also we've talked about the video opportunity a bit more broader on past calls, and as you integrated IndigoVision [ph] and WatchGuard, are you still expecting to grow at three times the video market rate, even with the introduction of a body worn camera, given the series of current events that have actually taken place in North America, do you still expect to go three times the market? Yeah. Sami, hi. It's Jack. There's really two questions. We've talked about growing three times the market really in the context of our fixed video business. And we -- yes. The answer to that is yes. We believe, and we think that the external market share data validates the fact that we're growing three times the market there. We -- with our recent acquisitions of both IndigoVision and Pelco, we've added incremental scale, incremental geographic coverage. We've broadened our portfolio with [indiscernible] and explosion proof technology that further -- we've also added open channels of distribution that will bolster our North America business. So, I think we're even in a better spot as we were just three months ago to continue to grow. And I think three times is a good marker.
As we pivot to body worn camera, we've had a body worn solution that came with the acquisition of WatchGuard. But I think right now, environmentally, the cost for more transparency in police in the U.S. -- by the way, in the U.S. and also abroad, we've got two deals in Europe, north of a million dollars here in the last few months for body worn cameras as well. Our pipeline is expanding. You heard my commentary around requests for quotes, both for body worn and for body and in car combination deals. We're seeing customers ask for accelerated deployments, and it really works out very well because in May, we announced our V300 new body worn camera. We think we've improved the quality. And just in the last two weeks, we've come out with a body worn camera is a service offering as well that the market had been asking for.
So listen, we feel really good about where we stand with fix video with adding incremental brand and coverage. And then, we love what's -- our opportunities in body worn, and we think the market wants alternatives in the body worn camera space as well. Got it. Thank you for those details. And then, maybe a quick one on Pelco. I know you guys disclosed the revenue run rate and the fact that it's going to be EPS dilutive. But do you guys have a timeframe in mind that when it's going to be EPS neutral or creative? And what growth rate of revenue should we expect for that acquisition or that revenue run rate? Yeah. So, as you pick up and we've talked about it being $55 million, maybe $60 million of contribution of top line this year, and slightly dilutive on EPS, approximately $0.03. So, as we get into next year, it will be dilutive again to a small amount. And then as -- the improvements to the business around growth, which we expect to execute into the 20 21 and beyond. Got it. Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start -- I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think about public sector budgets and whether you feel there could be any long tail impacts to those public safety revenue sources into future years or future periods, because of what you've seen in the last quarter or so from COVID? And specifically just any thoughts on income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes. And then I have a follow-up. Sure. Ben, it’s Jack. Maybe I'll take a stab at your -- the first part of your question. So, what we see with COVID has really been more around physical disruption of being able to meet with customers. I think we've done a good job in trying to make sure we had virtual connections with customers, integrations ability -- Kelly's team's ability to continue to service those customers. But as we talked about before -- and I think this is an important thing -- as it relates to the overall state of play with kind of call it policing budgets in the U.S., technology's actually a very small portion of that. Technology gives public safety leverage in the ability to be more efficient. So, actually as we think about our engagements with customers, our proposal flow pipeline and all those kinds of things, we've actually seen some of those things pick up. But the reality is no matter if -- no matter how something's funded, you're going to call 911, someone's going to have to be able to communicate. And I think we play a pretty prominent role there.
The other thing is you think about funding, I think a lot of attention is paid to sales tax funding, which has been most acutely impacted through COVID, but there's a multitude of different funding sources that really play within funding technology in the public space. It's property taxes, which quite frankly may actually improve. If you look at some of the home pricing and those kinds of things. Federal grant transfer dollars, and just even looking at the CARES Act, just for the first two phases, we'll probably increase funding to the coffers of public safety.
And the last thing and it's really important, because it's been part and parcel to a lot of our acquisitions is really around 911 funding. And so with all of this going on, and we read all the narrative in the media and the journal, New York Times and alike, just this Monday night, we had a deal in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that was approved the 911 -- they went to referendum. They call it a millage in the state of Michigan, went to vote, went to ballot to fund a P25 upgrade in Kalamazoo. And it was approved at a two-thirds to one-third by the public. And I think public will continue to make sure that they give the police fire, EMS officers, the best of breed technology. And quite frankly, despite all the narrative in the media, we haven't seen any kind of damage to our engagement and pipeline in the business. That's really helpful. Thanks. The other -- plays into this a little bit. I wanted to touch on -- kind of how you grade yourself in the command center initiative, within the call center, dispatch records, just your thoughts on progress market share. And I know there's a player out there that's somewhat distressed the PE roll off. I'm curious if you feel like, there's still a lot of market share out there to grab, just how you see that market developing. Thanks. Sure. I'll take that. This is Kelly, Ben. We're very pleased with the progress we're making in the command center. In fact, this quarter we announced our Records and our CAD products are now available in the cloud. We've had -- already had a number of sales and deployments that we're working on around that. We've announced a lot of new features associated with our 911 call taking, related to call transcriptions, some new features there.
And what you've probably heard on the call was also that we also just got awarded a deal with the state of Utah NGCS. And NGCS I'll just remind you is -- it is our -- it's a new growing part of our software business that provides enhanced data infrastructure for 911 system. So they can handle text, voice, multimedia, and other video applications and things that might be sent as a 911 call centers. And the way I'd simply described that, if you think about our 911 call centers, that folks sit in and handle calls, they typically are using our VESTA call taking software. It's basically been what I would call a single lane road going into call centers right now -- in the single lane road handled voice calls. That's it. What we're now doing is building a multi-lane highway that goes into these call centers that provides them the opportunity, as I said, to handle multimedia, voice, text, and video. And Utah's a good example of that. And that's going to be a growing new piece of our software business, but we're very pleased.
We're well landed with a lot of customers. We're continuing to see expansion in regards to sales and customers buying into the suite. And I think it's a great opportunity for us to take that install base that we have and continue to expand it with these new offerings that we're developing. Yeah. The thing I would add too is I think Kelly and his whole team from an internal expectation standpoint, they meet or beat the financial targets that we give them inside the company. Andrew Sinclair and his team have done great -- a great job integrating the suite and getting operating efficiencies out of the point solutions and point acquisitions we made, referenced again this quarter 260 basis points expansion in operating margin. And while we do expect operating margins over time to continue to grow and we now expect that Software and Services segment to be approximately 34%, that also has to be weighted into -- we'll make commensurate investments along the way too.
So, I think that the operating margin improvement in this segment, in total, will be a bit more measured. I don't think you can necessarily take the 500 some basis points done two quarters ago and 260 basis points this quarter and straight line it, it'll be a bit more measured. But I love the investment. I love the integration. We got a lot of outside technical talent largely based software skills out of Seattle and Salt Lake City. And I'm pleased with the progress being done all the way around that front. Thanks everyone. I appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if there's any significant shift in the mix of sales between infrastructure and devices. And within devices, any significance to the sort of the LTE based products. Is there a shift in favor of those at this time? I think that -- yeah, there's been some mixed shifts where devices have been down in Q2 in a more pronounced way, but by the way, it's consistent to the expectations, Paul, that we had. I had mentioned I think in May our PCR device business, which professional and commercial radio, think about it as kind of non-public safety radio sold to enterprise. That's been acutely affected, because it's largely anchored in verticals like oil and gas, airline travel hospitality. So that's been the most pronounced decline. We still expect the PCR business to be down approximately 35% for the full year 2020. So that device decline has been more acute as we talked about. And there's been some device decline as well in public safety, given the COVID-19 disruptions, but all pretty much within the envelope of expectations.
As it relates to LTE, nothing really new. LTE is a complimentary broadband network that compliments mission critical public safety and in the U.S. the P25 networks that are deployed. So, nothing -- no material change on that front. One area of consensus coming out of Washington is the need to kind of beef up rural communications. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing any spillover effect from those infrastructure funds that are being deployed? Paul, it's Jack. So, in public safety, we've got 43 state and provincial networks. I think out of the 47 that had been built, many of those are rural areas, so we've got good public safety coverage in rural America. And I think that's probably the biggest thing. We have continued to see by the way. There's also a couple of states that we deem rural that are looking at CARES funding to accelerate the acquisition of statewide upgrades. So, I think it's probably more generally CARES funding that they get directed to some of those rural states. Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Thanks, Paul. Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead. Thanks. Greg, last quarter, I think, you said public sector video hit the $50 million revenue mark roughly one year after your first launched video into the public sector. I recognize there's going to be quarterly volatility, but I'm hoping you can give us an update on that number.
And I guess the longer term question would be, if I remember correctly, you did $700 million video all-in in calendar 2019, almost all which by definition was from the commercial non-public sector market. And the thought arises, you just added Pelco over a hundred -- sounds like over $100 million annualize run rate. I think Indigo did $50 million last year, and that was growing at 12% and my understanding was -- is somewhat impaired at the time. So, you've just added $150 million of revenue on top of your video base.
When you look out into calendar 2021, what do you see for the video progression? I assume the public sector, given that it's so early in that adoption, we should expect public sector and Feds video very aggressively with or without the police to funding moment. And that $50 million by the end of this year, it could be in the high tens, not a $100 million. I think about it too aggressively. So Paul, if we dimensionalize the video security business all-in and you referenced a few assets, but if I think about Avigilon, IndigoVision and Pelco, and then VaaS and WatchGuard, given the organic development and the continued acquisitions, we're now approaching a $1 billion of annualized revenue. I think for this year, if I were to range, it I'd range it between $900 million and maybe $940 million of annualized video security revenue for us inside the company. So, it's consequential. It's more significant. It's against the backdrop of the largest addressable market we serve.
Molloy talked about on the fixed video side our ability and our expectation to continue to grow three X the market now. Historically fixed video was growing at about -- we think about video security and access control about 5%, that may not grow as high as that. It may be low single digits as an overall market, but our goal is still quite clear to take market share in fixed video. And on body worn video, I think the market is excited about the prospect of a vibrant second competitor and alternative choice. So, a lot of good things going on there now.
You referenced the video for IndigoVision and Pelco of previous periods, but again, it's also in the backdrop of COVID-19. So, you necessarily can't take a historical video number and extrapolate into 2021. I think it's fair to say we know that Pelco revenues will be less in 2020, both -- before they were owned by us and in the stub period annualized, Pelco revenue could be between $140 million and $150 million -- a $140 million and $150 million for 2020. And then our goal would be to stabilize that, use the global channel, use the second brand, use the international footprint, use the unique portfolio into the federal market that Pelco affords this.
There's a lot of interesting possibilities that company and that brand present to us as an owner that I don't think standalone they necessarily could gain on their own. We continue to make progress on the video side, on the government side. Maybe Jack can talk to that. Yeah. So, Paul, just two things. I think Greg hit it pretty well. The first thing is, as we think about the government piece of it, that's education as well as public safety. And I think one thing I want to note that we're all exceptionally proud of is the team's agility and how quick they move to market when they were working from home to develop the COVID-19 dashboard. So, think about kids going back to school and the universities and in the K through 12 environment, we've developed software that can do occupancy counting within classrooms or the workplace, social distancing metrics, mass detections. Through use of our access control manager, we can do correlation reports [technical difficulty] to the workplace or to schools, that software will continue to help us in the -- not only in government, we believe in the enterprise space as well. Hey, Greg and Jack, to my question about relative to the $50 million you did in the first quarter for public sector. Can you give us an update on that? Yeah. I think we -- as much as Q3, obviously -- so I guess I'll answer it this way. We were impacted in April and May pretty severely. But we saw pickup. We grew -- in June -- we grew 7% in June. And we saw the government business pick up. In fact, we landed in other north of million dollar deal with a federal agency. Education business picked up again in June. Probably wasn't quite 50, but, directionally the business is still very strong. All right. Greg, just a clarification on your PCR comment. If I recall, PCR was a $1 billion annual business for you. So when you saw about it being down 35%, I'm sorry -- about $350 million ballpark. That's right. Approximately, yes. All right. I'll pass it on. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Trevor filling in for Keith. Could you talk about how canceled deals compared to delayed deals in the second quarter? And when would you expect the delayed deals to become realized? Sure. Trevor, so to be candid, and I think I'd be aware of him because I'm forced by someone that'd be very detailed. And I said, no, I'm kidding. But we didn't have any deals that were canceled. What we've seen and I think you've probably heard this is, we did have delayed engagements on meeting. So, when we started analyzing pipeline in April and really the first two weeks of May, we saw some new deal creation that slowed. The other piece of it is from an integration standpoint. We saw the physical ability to access sites. And those access command centers as we were deploying command center software. We had some delays, but I would tell you equally, we've virtually deployed eight countywide networks in Q2. And the other piece of it that I think, that Kelly and his team has done an excellent job on is we actually have seen our -- the renewals for our management support service contracts in North America have not only been signed -- on-time signage, but actually upsold as well. So, I think that the services team did an excellent job on that.
So nothing canceled. Some delays and pushed to the right, but we've seen renewals for our service management support agreements accelerate not only in size, but in terms of on-time signage as well. Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that is, if we take the regional lens through the business we talked about engagements improving incrementally in North America in June and July. If we look at the rest of the world, the international business, I would say that since May Latin America has stepped down, we expect that to be down now about $90 million for the full year, which is an incremental $60 million decline from May, but that's largely offset positively by the acquisition of Pelco, but that's the only other color I did. But no cancellations, delayed deals beginning, and again, beginning to get some traction, Kelly's on service renewals, customer renewals on-time, and in some cases, it increased value. Okay. Great. Thanks. [Operator Instructions]
Our next question will come from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Thank you and good evening. Earlier in the conference call, you pretty much alleviated the concerns about the funding of projects. You talked about the prioritization to first responders, which is believable and just fine. My question is as things are being bid on, are you being asked to give proposal on? And I don't want the answer to be both. Is it more command center or more like body worn camera or more security? I know you kind of talked about all of them, but when we get excited about the -- yeah, dimensionalizing the three. It's a great question. If we take it from a revenue view and take the revenue opportunity around securing infrastructures that are unencrypted today, cloud and body worn, I think -- and I'll have Jack jumped in, I would say probably securing land mobile radio network opportunities with -- from an all-in revenue opportunity would be number one.
And what would you say between body worn and cloud? Body worn right now, and then followed -- from a revenue perspective, followed closely by cloud as well. And also because the cloud opportunities that we would capture are largely as a service going forward. So, in terms of their revenue, significance annualized. It's less than the other two. But over the longer term, obviously, a cloud customer with an annuity based as a service is a very valuable financial customer. And then my follow on is, I know it's not a razor blade model. But I assume kind of once you get in with say, body worn cameras or something else you naturally are picking up and pitching the cross selling. Can you talk a little bit about that? Are you seeing a lot of success or any metrics of X percent of cross selling you've seen or anything like that we can be just be conscious of? Yeah. So, one of the things we do and we're very conscious of when we make acquisitions and we continue to bring things into the public safety or the enterprise portfolio is really who's the decision makers and what's our capability to get in front of those customers. And do we have trust? Do we have influence with those customers? So, a lot of the success you've seen and we're seeing with body worn cameras and frankly, in the command center software space as well, our customers that really -- those relationships were founded upon. They've had long lasting relationships with our public safety P25 network. So, there's a lot of commonality and decision makers in public safety. And we've had good -- I think good success in terms of going and continuing to add and build on those trusted relationships. So, cross-sell is just part of the DNA. We ask our account managers.
Jim, just to give you -- just to kind of, alliterate it, we have a three dimensional view of every account. And we look at every technology we bring to bear. And we essentially have a stop sign type chart to say where we are in the progress, who's our competition and all those kinds of things. So, that gives you a perspective, but that's how we make decisions on what to buy and then how we go approach customers. Jim, I might just add on the cross-sell component. I think that we definitely -- from a sense when there's body worn, it feeds into our records platform on command -- in our command center. But we're still seeing a lot of traction with our customers in regards to them expanding into the suite. And certainly, there's a high level of cross-sell across whole aspects of our suite from the 911 call handling into the CAD products and into the Records products. And the integration that we provide underneath in regards to helping our customers manage that entirety of that workflow through its full complexity, not just body worn video and handling video, but handling everything that comes in to a customer from the 911 call, to all the way to what happens in an incident, all the way to the body worn video, all the way into jail records and court. Those are things that are critical to our customers and they look for a customer to give them an integrated view. So, they all work together as Jack referenced. And in particular, I'd just say in the command center side, it's incredibly important there on that cross-sell. Next question. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yokum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. Yeah.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We’ve posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we’ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today’s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I’ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our Q3 results and outlook.
First, I’m proud of the team and I’m pleased with our results and execution in these challenging times. During the quarter, we achieved both revenue and earnings per share above the guidance we provided in August driven by growth in video security, command center software and services. Additionally, we generated $392 million of operating cash flow and strengthened our portfolio by closing the acquisitions of Pelco, a leader in fixed video security solutions and Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile apps provider for law enforcement.
Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew revenue 9%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated over half of the operating earnings for the company. We were also awarded the largest command center software order in our history, $120 million plus next generation 911 multi-year contract.
And finally, while the environment with COVID certainly remains fluid, I’m encouraged by the improvements we saw in many areas of our business during the quarter. Orders for body-worn cameras were up significantly year-over-year. Sales of fixed video to our government customers were strong, and we saw improved demand from both our public safety LMR and PCR customers versus Q2.
I’ll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Q3 results included revenue of $1.9 billion down 6% from a year ago, including $55 million from acquisitions.
GAAP operating earnings of $352 million and operating margins of 18.9% of sales compared to 20.7% in the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $463 million down $46 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.8%, down from 25.5% in the year-ago quarter due to lower sales and gross margin contribution in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.
GAAP operating earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.51 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.95 versus $2.04 last year, primarily due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales gross margin and improved operating leverage in Software and Services.
OpEx in Q3 was $455 million, down $49 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q3 effective tax rate was 20% compared to 23% in the year prior, a change driven primarily by higher R&D credits and a favorable U.S. Federal return to provision adjustment recorded in the third quarter.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $392 million compared with $525 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $343 million compared with $465 million in the year prior.
The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales. Capital allocation for Q3 included $181 million for acquisitions, $109 million in cash dividends, $105 million to share repurchases and $49 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we refinanced upcoming debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3%.
And finally, we repaid $400 million against our revolving credit facility, of which $300 million was repaid during the quarter and $100 million subsequent to quarter end. We expect to repay the remaining $100 million balance by year end.
Moving to segment results, Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion down 14% driven by a decline in public safety, LMR and PCR partially offset by growth in video security. Operating earnings were $219 million or 18.9% of sales down 330 basis points from last year, primarily due to lower sales.
Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include a $44 million P25 order with a large U.S. Federal customer, a $28 million P25 order for the state of Wyoming, a $20 million P25 order for the state of North Carolina, a $19 million TETRA order for a large international transportation customer and we saw a strong growth in fixed video sales to government customers during the quarter.
Moving to our Software and Services segment. Revenue was $705 million up 9% from last year, driven by growth in both services and software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million. Operating earnings were $244 million or 34.6% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, gross margin and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include and over $120 million next generation 911 multi-year contract, a $19 million body-worn and in-car video multi-year as a service contract in North America and an $18 million P25 multi-year services contract with Seminole County, Florida. Additionally, we received strong orders for body-worn cameras, launched our PremierOne Cloud software suite and closed the acquisition of Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile application provider for law enforcement.
Looking at regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.3 billion, down 6% due to declines in public safety, LMR and professional commercial radio, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. International Q3 revenue was $600 million down, 8% primarily due to decline in public – professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. Sales grew in Europe while Latin America declined on continued challenges from COVID-19.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.7 billion down $361 million, compared to last year, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America and $81 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $174 million, driven by growth in North America and $93 million of favorable currency rates.
Software and Services backlog was down $44 million or 1% compared to last year due to revenue recognition on the Airwave, ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America, multi-year agreements and $74 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was up $138 million or 2% due to growth in North America and $83 million of favorable currency.
Products and SI segment backlog was down $317 million or 10% compared to last year, primarily due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying some sales engagements. Sequentially, backlog was up $36 million or 1% driven primarily by international.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be down between 6% and 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.71 and $2.76 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of 175 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. For the full year, we now expect sales to be down approximately 6.5%, up from our prior guidance of a 7% decline with non-GAAP EPS between $7.52 and $7.58, up from our prior guidance of $7.40 to $7.52, and our outlook for operating cash flow is now approximately $1.55 billion, up $50 million from our previous guidance, driven by higher earnings and improvements in working capital.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. And let me just end with a few thoughts. First, I’m very pleased with the progress we’re making in our command center software business. Our command center software suite now covers the entire mission workflow from 911 intake to case closure and management. It’s a $500 million business, which has been growing consistently and improving its profitability while also transitioning towards the SaaS model.
Just this month, we announced our PremierOne Cloud suite, which includes fully functional CAD, and mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government Cloud. So, this means we now can provide our customers the flexibility of deploying their software, either on-prem or in a fully featured cloud deployment.
Currently, we have over 3,500 command center software customers with over 500 of those using two or more components of the suite. In Q3, half of our new orders were from customers further expanding into the suite, demonstrating this continued growth opportunity as customers embrace integrated software to run their operations.
Second, the increased demand we’re seeing for cloud solutions is not just in command center software. Customers are increasingly seeing the benefits of the cloud across their entire workflow. In LMR or land mobile radio, we’ve launched our CirrusCentral cloud-based offerings for P25 networks that provide remote management and backup core options for our radio customers.
In video security, we launched a video-as-a-service offering for body-worn cameras that includes our cloud-based digital evidence management software, as well as Avigilon cloud services, which now has over 4,000 ACC 7.x sites connected to the cloud. All of these subscription-based offerings provide increased capabilities to our customers and opportunities for us to grow recurring revenues.
And finally, through the global pandemic, natural disasters and civil unrest, our customers continue to depend on and rely on our solutions as need to have, demonstrating the criticality of what we provide and our teams and people’s resilience in support of our customers around the world was nothing and is nothing short of remarkable.
Additionally, we were just recently recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the world’s most sustainably managed companies ranking the sixth highest in the country. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on supporting both our customers and our people while also deploying the capital to drive growth and continued shareholder return.
And with that, Tim, I’ll turn it back to you. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I’d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask the question? [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi, there. thank you and congrats on the solid results in 3Q. I first wanted to ask about the $120 million 911 contract that you guys signed that was the highest in the company’s history, and maybe two pieces to this. How will that that be recognized over time, kind of like the first question? And then I know there’s probably going to be similar deals like this in the future, probably not at the same magnitude, but maybe, could you give us a little bit of an idea on how popular this type of specific large deal could potentially be in demand in the medium to long-term? Sure. hey, Sami, it’s Kelly. So, on the NGCS, I think I would say three things about it. First off, look, we’re really excited about that part of the business. It is the entry point for all 911 calls, and as I think I may have referenced on a prior call, what that effectively does is creates the EazzyNet multi-lane highway entry point to 911 centers, where they can now handle video, audio, pictures, text, versus the single-lane highway of voice that they could handle before. The second thing I’d say about this deal is when you think about it, this and other similar deals like that will get on NGCS. There’s always an installation component that’s upfront. And then there’s a longer tale of as a service, where we’ll run the system for our customers and that’s similar to what we have here in the multi-year contract.
The third thing I’d just remind you about – around NGCS, is while we have some of our own software and componentry in it, we are also acting as a systems integrator. So, we are, in effect, reselling backhaul and other components as an offering for the entire solution, which is a bit different than what we do in our 911 call-taking software or our CAD software, where we are the entirety of the software solution. But we’re excited about this. We think that NGCS and EazzyNet is – I would call it, if you’re looking at a nine inning baseball game, I think we’re somewhere around maybe, the second or the third inning, so we’re early in the conversion of EazzyNet across the United States. So, there’s certainly other deals out there, and we’ll just continue to fight for those and update you on those as they come. And Sami, this contract, $120 million plus, will be rev-recognized over a multi-year, long-term contract. Got it. Thank you. And then Greg, just one question for you. We still have the $9 billion of revenue and $10 EVP – EPS guideposts laid out for 2021, and obviously, COVID may have shifted this around a little bit, but I was hoping you’d give us a little bit of an update around this guidepost or this framework on how we should be thinking about what’s to come in the medium to long-term. Yes. Well, obviously COVID was the ultimate disrupter, but I would say is I’m pleased with the momentum of how the business is performing. We talked about Q2 of this year, Sami, being a low point. We would improve in Q3. We expect to improve in Q4. I think the print for this quarter reflects some of that improvement.
All I would say look, I’m not going to guide 2021. I think that would be premature. But I would say as we sit here today and I don’t have a crystal ball, I would expect us to grow and return to overall revenue growth next year, and I would also expect us to grow in both segments for next year. but again, we’ll update you a quarter from now on the next earnings call. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks, Sami. Our next question is from George Notter of Jeffries. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. thanks very much. I was really interested in some of your comments, Greg, on the software business. I think you mentioned a $500 million run rate at this point. Can you talk a little bit more about how that – I would imagine that run rate is getting cannibalized to some degree as you move customers from perpetual software licenses to a subscription, and can you talk about potential cannibalization on that revenue run rate, or maybe, talk about the mixture of customers that are converting to subscription, or anything you can that give us more insight in that transition. Thanks. Sure, George. So, the majority of the software revenue today is license revenue. Kelly and Andrew have done a good job, Cloud-enabling the suite. The only component left to Cloud-enable is Records, which will be done in the first half of 2021. So, we’re incrementally moving more and more customers to as-a-service. But again, I think we’re still going to be able to manage that transition from perpetual license incrementally to more as a service without any major dislocation or disruption of top-line revenues.
Said another way, you see that Software and Services will perform this year in the high single digits and I expect Software and Services in total in the segment and both sub segments, Software and Services, to continue to grow in 2021 as well, even while we’re transitioning those clients gradually to as-a-service. I view that as a multiyear transition. And George, the only thing I might add to Kelly is the – we’re really excited about the command center software suite we just announced, which now fully cloud-enables CAD, records, and our mobile. That’s in addition to already what we do in Aware, our vast license plate recognition is as-a-service, and also, our Kodiak part of the portfolio as well. The only part of the entirety of what we have that won’t be cloud-enabled yet is our 911 call taking. That should happen in the first half of next year. And in addition to that, we’re excited about what we just did with Callyo, the acquisition we just did, which picks up a very large customer base of folks that are using that mobile application, which is also an as-a-service part of the portfolio. Got it. Okay. And then one just quick housekeeping item. I didn’t see it in the press release or the presentation, but was there an FX impact on top line in the quarter and can you tell us what that was? Thanks. It was pretty small. Okay. Our next question today is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could shed a light on the ability to do sales this quarter, in terms of last quarter, I think what we heard was about challenges in terms of getting in to see the customers. How would that develop over the third quarter and is that a challenge going into the fourth quarter? Sure. Hey, Keith, it’s Jack. Good afternoon. Yes. So, we saw sequential improvement in terms of our ability to engaging customers and just to kind of give you the geographic around the world. First of all, in North America, in government, we’ve been able to engage in person with customers and we’ve seen that manifest in terms of increase in proposals and sequential increase in terms of our LMR business and as Kelly pointed out, command center and video. In Europe, it’s important to point out 55% of our revenue in Europe is recurring revenue. But we are starting to see, we saw certainly in Q3, both in the enterprise market and government, the ability of our customers to actually come, and extend and meet us virtually.
So, that’s been an improvement. Asia-Pac, same thing. The one area of the world, where we’re having essentially lockdown, continues to be lockdown and we’ve got very much diminished expectations is Latin America. But I would certainly say it’s improved, been really proud of the resilience of the team in terms of use of videoconferencing and really trying to engage our customers and pull them along. We’ve been heavy in terms of virtual trade shows and demonstrations. And as I said in government; particularly, in public safety, we engage with our customers in person masked up, et cetera. And Keith, just one other anecdote I’d give you is we just completed Kelly’s team, the Annual Software Summit just a few days ago. We did it in person a year ago. We just completed the virtual multiday engagement just a few days ago, and attendance was literally double virtually. So, I think Molloy’s team and Kelly’s team, and our customers quite frankly, have been good in transitioning virtual engagement, digital engagement, business continuity. It depends on the theaters Jack referenced internationally, but we’ve been able to navigate that much better than we were doing a quarter ago. Got you. Appreciate that. And just a follow-up there. In terms of changing gears actually, in terms of like FirstNet and Airwave, can you give us the latest on where LTE versus LMR kind of stands in terms of around the world? I think the high-level answer is no change from the last time we spoke to you. 4G and ultimately, as it transitions here in North America to 5G, LTE or 5G is a complimentary technology to mission critical land mobile radio. I think the awards that Winkler went through on state awards and upgrades, particularly in state and local reinforce and reference the criticality need to have dimensions of land mobile radio.
As it relates to Airwave, I think it’s the same thing. We believe – we remain in active discussions with the customer and we do have an expectation that that Airwave contract will get another extension. But that timing will be dictated largely by the customer. But again, I think LMR, LTE, or if you want to substitute that and say LMR 5G coexist, and quite frankly, we think the upgrade in faster speeds domestically and in the UK are good for command center, good for our video security business and overall, are a net positive. Great. thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start with a question on margins. Between the two segments, it’s been a little tale of two cities. In Products and SI, that’s been the drag on overall performance, but probably, the biggest opportunity moving forward. So, hoping you can maybe, just walk through some of the moving parts to get this segment back to the kind of 22% to 23% operating margin range from years past. Does revenue need to get back above $5 billion? Are there things you can do from an opex standpoint and just a timing to that? Yes, Adam. So, kind of taking – let’s take a look at OpEx overall. For the full year, we’ll remove about $250 million of OpEx out of this business this year year-over-year. If you net that to include acquisitions, it’s a net $170 million reduction. So, I think the team has moved quickly and did a good job on expense structure, both structural and variable, to adapt to the COVID environment we got hit with a couple of quarters ago. So, think of OpEx this year, all in, year-over-year, being down net $170 million, about approximately $100 million of that returns next year in the form of incentive compensation.
Operating margins for the two segments, we still expect Software and Services to be consistent with what we told you last time, with operating margins for the full year 2020 of being about 34%. Obviously, the product segment declines this year, given the top-line volume decline. I expect the operating margins obviously to improve with volume. And even though $100 million of OpEx returns next year, that’s as we sit here today, we’ll always look to see if we can refine or further improve that cost structure. But that’s kind of a composite view. Okay. And maybe, just as a follow-up, I’d imagine from a top-line standpoint, one of the big drivers in that segment is going to be the PCR business. If you could just maybe, just update us on where that business fits today, and into 4Q, so that we can kind of think about the opportunity moving forward into 2021 as it potentially rebounds? Yes. I think that PCR has been incrementally – it clearly was an extreme low point in Q2. It’s performed a little bit better in Q3 and we expect it to improve a little bit better, that’s informed into our overall Q4 guidance. PCR, as you know, has been hit with primarily, the critical industries that have gotten slammed by COVID the most: hospitality, entertainment, transportation, oil and gas, and quite frankly, I think that we expect PCR to return to some form of growth in 2021. And that’s in part what informs our expectations for the product segment to return to growth as well. It also might be worth noting that even in this environment, North America, which represents our largest theater and is sold primarily through channels. the channel inventory in North America is down. So that’s a good – that’s another good indicator in terms of potential foundation for us to continue to print improvement as time goes on. And maybe, one other thing, Greg. Just historically as we look at PCR, new product introduction, even in challenging times, equates to growth, and we do have some product refresh on the slate for 2021 as well. Got it. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Jack. Our next question is from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you. Yes, two if I could here. Greg, maybe first, just talk a little bit high level about the state of your customers, state and local budgeting, given the macro and stimulus and anything of note there, any changes? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit on the video side? You mentioned that getting good traction with the government to maybe, just give us a little bit more color there, how much video is ramping there, and are you seeing kind of any level of cross-selling across that video business? Thank you. Sure, Tim. Just to take them in reverse order, on video specifically, let’s start out with body-worn video. We had the strongest quarter we’ve had. Really, good demand for a lot of the obvious demand driver reasons you would suspect, but I think Molloy and John Kedzierski and the team are doing a good job with the acquisition we made there in the form of WatchGuard. Quite frankly, also another impetus behind the body-worn video growth is international performance, which came through an acquisition as a part of WatchGuard called Edesix.
So, I like our performance there and also, I like the increased demand. We also did have strong growth in fixed video to government, solid double-digit growth. I think a reflection of – we’ve said the sales cycle is always longer in state and local and fed, but very good performance on fixed video into the government. By the way, Pelco being a benefit to that as well, given the fact that that acquisition came with a lot of contractual government clearances that allowed us to move right in to further fed government purchases that were beneficial.
In terms of state and local customers, Jack mentioned it. I think that our customers have found a good way to engage during these challenging times. Many of them do meet in person. We also meet digitally or virtually. And remember, the state and local budgets have been largely set. So that’s a good thing that moves us well into next year. We’ve also been the beneficiaries of CARES Act money from the feds, and I think that has had a favorable impact as well. So I don’t know, Jack, if you want to add anything on the state and local budgets beyond that? No, Tim, I think it’s just prioritization, prioritization, prioritization. As you’ve heard me mention before, we’re not in the business of a nice to have, we’re in the business of a need to have in terms of emergency response. So really, we continue to see our customers drive projects through. The other thing is, I think that sometimes losses, there’s just a multitude of different funding sources. Greg talked about CARES Act, but there’s also things like special purpose local option taxes, which are still getting passed. And so we remain highly engaged with our customers. We see great demand across the portfolio and government and as we know with what’s happening in the world right now, security means a great deal to cities, to states, and I think to our federal government. So more to follow, but we’re encouraged with what we see. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, Tim. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Greg, I think, I heard somebody mention that your business is 55% recurring. What is recurring revenue for the overall company? No, I think Molloy’s reference was that the majority of our European revenue is recurring, largely because of the Airwave contract. My fault. No, that’s all right, Paul, but if you look at overall, Software and Services, which we view as largely a proxy for recurring. This year, in full year 2020, Software and Services will be higher than 35% for this year, which we view as a favorable byproduct of the year, I guess, so that’s good. Then as a follow-up. On the government’s piece of video, looking out to next year, coming off this year, any quantification you can provide us, ballpark in terms of how big – I know you just started selling over a year ago, but how big can that business be next year, and how big will it be this year? Well, so just to kind of – if you take all of the video assets that we have, fixed, body-worn, in-car, license plate recognition, domestically and internationally, this business, all-in for assets, hardware, software, is likely to be about $940 million, Paul, for this year. You’ve heard us talk about growing it 3x the market. That 3x the market is around the fixed video and access control piece, which we still believe we can achieve. If you take the size of the video market, all-in, worldwide, and we always zero China out, given their indigenous competitors, this is about an $18 billion – $17 billion to $18 billion business, addressable market. It’s actually the largest addressable market we have. So, I think there’s room to run here with the assets we’ve accumulated along with the analytics that our team is developing and intelligent edge devices as well. Greg, I appreciate that. I was actually focused on the government piece market that you entered back about a year ago. I think he’s – hey, Paul. So, I think we had mentioned probably maybe three calls ago, probably nine months ago, the question was asked, hey, how big is your government video business? And really, we said approximately $200 million at the time, and that’s an aggregation of two things. It’s the mobile video market that’s come through vis-à-vis, the WatchGuard acquisition, as well as Greg had mentioned, the Edesix that also came as an acquisition.
The remnants of it are fixed video security sales into all governments, and I would tell you, both of those businesses are growing strong double-digits right now. Both fixed video into government, we’ve talked about the success we had in Q3, both in the feds and state and local, but also, we highlighted some of the success we had in body-worn in terms of unit and dollar bookings substantially up in the strong double-digits there. So hopefully, that helps. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. Our next question will come from Fahad Najam of MKM. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. Greg, I want to ask you a big picture question. In light of the view that most of your government customers are very slow to move and they tend to be not driven by – like usually, enterprises are driven by profits and maximizing profits, your government customers tend to be more slower. Are you noticing any kind of an inflection point in your government customers’ decision-making when it comes to whether it’s Next Gen 911 command center solutions or video? Are we beginning on a new trend and that’s going to accelerate going forward? I would say this. I mean, in the command center software, Next Gen 911 is a new opportunity for us, and that’s obviously a favorable trend. The other thing I’d say, in terms of decision cycles is command center software, historically has had some of the oldest legacy technology and workflow processes literally over several years, 10, 15 years plus. So, I actually think that the inflection point is COVID-induced in part that’s accelerating decisions to the cloud. Traditionally state and local customers would prefer control, and they’d confer – they’d prefer on-prem. I actually think that this pandemic has been a positive accelerant to decision-making around command center software, particularly around cloud.
I think this suite that Kelly and Andrew’s team has built also can be an accelerant to decision-making because instead of trying to decide a forklift process and an all or nothing, you can get an anchor tenant module in place and then upgrade those modules for additional components along the suite.
On land mobile radio, we literally have tens of thousands of different contracts that are at different lengths and the systems are in different ages. The pandemic and the civil unrest has been an accelerant to some older systems here in North America that needed to be upgraded to digital and with state-of-the-art encryption to protect the communities and the local law enforcement better. I think as Molloy and his team have built new devices, APX NEXT, in TETRA, the MPX600 that’s just announced, those two represent events and opportunities for our customers to make decisions to refresh as well. Greg, you hit it really well. I think the other thing that – we have a compelling ecosystem for our customers. That’s an overused term, but I say that under the lens of Greg nailed it. Devices that work with command center, how do you extract, how do you disseminate information in a mobile environment? Those are the expectations that we’ve seen, frankly, for a number of years in the enterprise space and government is certainly catching up to that. And I think those will be accelerants moving forward for us in public safety. Thanks. You touched upon a follow-up piece that I wanted to ask, which is, as your government customers migrate command and control infrastructure to Next Gen digital platforms, is that creating a resulting opportunity in new applications like mission critical push to talk features on the radio? And if that’s the case, are you beginning to see that and can you quantify that opportunity? This is Kelly. I would say, it’s not that it’s offering up those type of opportunities in the mission critical push to talk, but it offers up the opportunity to enrich the whole workflow with multimedia. And at the edge, officers today carry a mobile device with them. They can receive now from the command center video, images, and data that they couldn’t receive before. But the radio as part of the workflow is instrumental in regards to its uniqueness of its communication that it provides. So it’s not so much about mission-critical push to talk as much as it’s about enriching the entire command center workflow with all the information that we’re very used to dealing with today in our day-to-day lives. It’s now enabling that across that mission critical operational workflow so they can manage that information from 911 call intake to record in case management at the end. If I can rephrase my question, which was a little bit more simpler, I wasn’t particularly honing in on mission critical push to talk. What I was trying to get at is are you beginning to see a refresh of your devices business as a result of the upgrade in the new command and control software that you’re now selling? Yes, we are. So, we announced last October the APX NEXT device. We’ve already built north of $100 million in terms of funnel opportunities for that. We’re very encouraged. Remember, we introduced devices at the top end. So as we get through 2021, we’ll start to broaden the reach of those devices. We see great demand for those devices because it’s not only purpose built P25 communications, which is truly bedrock of how cities and states and public safety communicate, but to bring in LTE capabilities for back up push to talk, the ability to do on the fly programming and those kinds of things, it brings a number of those different things, so excited about that.
Greg talked about, just this week, we announced a collaborative device for the TETRA market in Europe, and essentially we’re booked out for the year this year, so we’re really encouraged about that as well. So, we see a need for devices that can do more for our customers as I said earlier in terms of aggregating, disseminating, and really intelligence within their ecosystem. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Josh Kehoe on for Jim Suva. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide any more color on the headwinds you’re facing in the public safety LMR business and when you expect to be through them? And is it largely due to COVID-19 or is there more to it? Thank you. I think the headwinds we talked about when COVID hit us back in March were PCR and the industries that were affected by it and public safety LMR, quote-unquote, being pushed to the right. The push to the right largely around sales engagement and deployments, I don’t think that’s changed at all. That’s still the primary reason for the push to the right. Although I will tell you, it performed – its public safety LMR performed better than our expectations in Q3, and we expect it to improve again in Q4, which informs our guide. And I think public safety LMR and PCR, as I referenced earlier, I think will both improve, which will primarily drive why we expect the product segment to return to growth next year. There’s a lot of still budget sources that Molloy referenced, we’ve been the beneficiaries of The CARES Act as well, but that’s what I would say. Yes, the only thing I’d just piggyback onto Greg’s comments there, the one issue that we’ve been challenged with is actually physical deployment of systems in the Middle East and Africa and in Latin America. So, we’re completely impaired to go do anything, and that’s really elongated our ability to recognize revenues in those theaters. Okay. And as a follow-up, as we look into 2021, how are you thinking about prioritizing M&A versus share repurchases? Thank you. I think that our capital allocation framework is 50-30-20. 50% of the cash flow being available for either acquisitions or share repurchase. It’s a fungible amount, depending upon the opportunities that are in front of us. 30% is dividend, and 20% is CapEx. So that framework, loosely, is that it’s not meant to be a prescription, but it’s a framework. We were active in buying back shares at these levels, as you’ve seen in Q3. We think these are attractive levels to buy the stock in Q3. And we’ll evaluate opportunities as they come. We’ve done tuck-in acquisitions on the video side, on the software side. I think that in regards to acquisitions next year, it will be, in part, a reflection of what opportunities come our way. But that’s the thinking around the deployment of capital at this point. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. No additional comments. Thanks for joining us today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.
We’ve posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we’ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during the presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today’s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I’ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results as well as our outlook. First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance, had our largest quarter ever for LMR orders in North America and we ended the year with record backlog of $11.4 billion, up $175 million versus last year and up $750 million sequentially. Additionally, we generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and 1.6 billion for the full year.
Second, our software and services segment had another strong quarter as demand for our LMR services, video security and command center software continues to drive growth. For the full year the segment grew 9%, expanded operating margins by 290 basis points and accounted for 37% of total revenues and 52% of total operating earnings for the entire company. Additionally, the recurring nature of this segment and record ending backlog provides us with good visibility going forward and we expect another year of strong growth in this segment in 2021. Finally, we saw a number of events during the year that continue to reinforce the importance of having secure reliable mission critical communications for first responders. Whether it was the hurricanes in the southeast, fires in California or more recently, the explosion in Nashville, our LMR networks continued to provide private, secure voice communication to the men and women on the front lines when other networks were down. And while we continue to invest in broadband solutions that augment LMR with valuable data and location capabilities, the redundancy, resiliency, and reliability that LMR provides during the most critical moments continues to be foundational and a must have for our customers.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jason to take through your results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4% including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $555 million and operating margins of 24.4% compared to 24.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $667 million, down $40 million or 6% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, down from 29.7%, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 compared to $1.39 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a noncash charge of $1.53 booked in Q4 of 2019 related to the actions taken then to derisk our pension. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 versus $2.94 last year, down primarily due to lower sales from Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. OpEx in Q4 was $492 million, down $31 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend, lower incentives and then partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year.
Moving to the full year 2020. Our revenue was $7.4 billion, down 6% primarily related to lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR products, partially offset by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenues from acquisitions was $203 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.4 billion or 18.7% of sales versus 20% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales from Products and SSI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. Non-GAAP operating earnings grew $1.8 billion, down $140 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 24.8% of sales, a decrease of only 20 bps despite the sales declines in Products and SI, driven by the actions we implemented around costs, lower incentives and growth in Software and Services.
GAAP earnings per share was $5.45 compared to $4.95 in the prior year, which included the previously mentioned noncash charge for pension. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.69, down 3% from $7.96 in 2019 on lower sales and operating earnings, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in 2020. For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion, down $162 million from last year, primarily driven by lower incentives, lower discretionary spend and offset by $75 million from acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2020 was 20% compared to 22.4% in the prior year on higher R&D tax credits and higher tax benefits from share based compensation recognized in the current year.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million compared with $795 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $637 million compared with $736 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year and free cash flow was $1.4 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was driven by lower sales and higher cash taxes in the current year, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Capital allocation in 2020 for us included $612 million of share repurchases at an average price of 155 and $0.93 per share, $436 million in cash dividends and $287 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we refinanced outstanding debt maturities with a new $900 million 10 year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3% and raised our dividend 11%.
Moving to our segment results. Q4 products and system integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 10% primarily due to lower sales of public safety LMR and lower sales of professional and commercial radio partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. Operating earnings were $408 million or 27% of sales, down from 28.9% in the prior year on lower sales. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include $122 million P25 order for Nassau County, New York, a $61 million P25 order for state of New Jersey, over 50 million of P25 orders from several large North America utilities customers, a $26 million P25 order from Morris County, New Jersey, and a $20 million tetra order in the UK. Additionally, we had another quarter of double digit growth in fixed video sales into our government customers. For the full year, revenue in the segment was $4.6 billion, down 13% in the prior year, driven by lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions was $119 million. Operating earnings were $880 million or 19% of sales, down from 22% in the prior year on lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $763 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million. Operating earnings were $259 million or 33.9% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $100 million P25 managed services contract with the State of Tasmania, Australia, a $79 million tetra managed services contract extension in Europe, a $30 million P25 multiyear service contract with the Minnesota DOT, a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with Austin, Texas, and finally an $11 million award for a command center software contract in Norway. For the full year, revenue was $2.8 billion, up 9% on growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was$84 million. Operating earnings in 2020 were $955 million or 34.3% of sales, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage.
Looking next at our regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.2 billion, down 5% with declines in public safety, LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. International Q4 revenue was $725 million, down 6% due to declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security and LMR services. Revenues declined in Latin America and Asia-Pac while EMEA was up 2%. And for the full year, international revenue was $2.4 billion, down 8% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security, command center software and LMR services. Revenue declined for the year in Latin America and Asia pack while EMEA was flat year-over-year.
Moving to backlog. Our ending backlog was a record $11.4 billion, up $175 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $753 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Software and Services backlog was up $213 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for airways. Sequentially, backlog was up $518 million with growth in both regions. Products and SI backlog was down $38 million compared to last year, driven by delays in sales engagements during the year related to COVID-19. Sequentially, backlog was up $236 million in Products and SI, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter.
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 5.5% and 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.64. This assumes FX at current spot rates, a share count of approximately $174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up between 7.25% and 8% with mid single digit growth in Products and SI and low double digit growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.50 and $8.62 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates and a share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately $125 million related to higher cash taxes. And we expect full year OpEx to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a year over year increase of $75 million related to higher incentives as we plan for growth and $60 million related to acquisitions closed in 2020 offset by further cost reductions.
Finally, I'd like to highlight that we are updating our reporting to incorporate an enhanced disclosure around our three major technologies across both segments. As a result in our forthcoming 10-K, you will see net sales in our two segments reported in the following three technologies, LMR mission critical communications, video security and analytics, and command center software. We have provided a supplemental slide in the back of our earnings presentation, representing this view for the previous three years and on an ongoing basis, we will incorporate this into our quarterly reporting.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. And I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, I want to take a minute to talk about the substantial progress we're making in video security. Three years ago, we began our investment in video security with our acquisition of Avigilon. Since that time, we've added acquisitions that leverage our scale across our portfolio in AI powered analytics, NBAA compliant manufacturing, and go to market coverage. As a result, we expect to generate over a billion dollars in annual revenue this year across our portfolio of video security technologies. This includes our fixed end to end video security and access control solutions embedded with advanced analytics and mobile video, which includes purpose built body worn and in car video solutions that are integrated with back end evidence management software. Additionally, this quarter we began shipping cameras from our new global NBAA compliant video manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas.
In fixed video, we launched Avigilon cloud services last year to connect customers to cloud based analytics, system management and continuous updates. As customers embrace analytics to convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud or run their operations, we expect this to be a growth driver for the business. And in mobile video this quarter, we'll begin deploying customers on command central evidence, which is our next generation digital evidence management platform and a fully integrated component of our premier one cloud suite that includes CAD, mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government cloud. Currently, we have thousands of customers using either our digital evidence management system or command center software, and we believe the intersection of our install base and mobile video in the command center positions us well for continued growth.
Second, the investments we're making to integrate Video Security, Command Center software and LMR continue. This past summer, we launched Safety Reimagined, focusing the integration of our products into one unified ecosystem, helping our customers be more efficient and proactive in their security and safety operations. We're redefining the ease with which our AI enabled solutions adapt to the needs of our customers by removing systems silos, simplifying management and automating workflows for the effective detection, analysis, communication and response to incidents. Imagine a scenario where an unusual activity is detected by our Avigilon camera, all security guards with Motorola radios in the vicinity are notified and the case is automatically and seamlessly open in the Incident Management System. Simultaneously, live video streams from the relevant cameras are automatically pumped into the Avigilon control center, and an operator is able to verify the presence of a suspicious package by leveraging our appearance search feature. This intuitive, easily customizable interaction between technologies is enabled by our new cloud based business workflow automation software, Orchestra, which we launched just this past week.
Finally, as we close out literally a year like no other, I want to take a moment to reflect on everything we accomplished as a company. When COVID-19 hit, we moved swiftly and with focus to make a number of immediate decisions, including implementing a work from home policy to ensure the safety of our employees and reducing operating expenses, quickly culminating in $162 million OpEx reduction year-over-year inclusive of acquisitions. And yet we remain focused on executing in a challenging environment, with Software and Services growing every quarter and Products and SI improving in the second half as we expected. We also continue to deploy capital and invest for the future. We launched several new products, accelerated product migration to the cloud across our three technologies, acquired five companies, refinanced approximately $900 million of debt at very attractive low rates, repurchased 612 million of shares as well. And additionally, with Gino's retirement, we elevated Jason Winkler to the CFO position, a strong example of our readiness and succession planning.
I am really proud of the way our team performed during an unprecedented year. All that we've accomplished and the improvement in our sales engagements demonstrate the enduring strength and durability of both our business and our people, ending the year with a record backlog position is a testament to those efforts, and that momentum helps position us well for a year of strong growth, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I’d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow to accommodate as many participants as possible [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind all callers on the line how to ask a question? [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Two, if I could. First, maybe Greg, could you just give us an update, obviously, we're in a weird time with COVID and whatnot. But kind of what you're hearing from customers in the public safety side on budgeting and overall health of the customer base? And if there's any impact that you would see one way or the other, if there was some federal stimulus for state and local? And then the second one, maybe for you or Jack. On the video side, can you just talk about two of the areas, one is on the government side. Government, it sounds like it's going well. How much more room is there for growth as you further penetrate there? And then secondly, what does it take to do a better job on the body cam side and how do you see that as an opportunity? Thanks. So kind of overall, contextually, I feel pretty good about the demand signals we see overall at this point for 2021. Now obviously, we're still in a pandemic. We're matching supply and demand, given some of the supply constraints that we're currently going through. So our guidance is informed by those components and we think our full year is a prudent view given where we are. But I think that I'm really pleased with Q4, in particular, a record quarter in North America, a record quarter specifically with LMR in North America and finishing the year with record backlog are all positive trends. Environmentally, we transitioned from one administration to another. I think that what we do rises to the top of the food chain despite Republican or Democratic presidential administrations. I think our federal business, and Jack could talk about it, in 2020 was solid overall. It was down slightly but it was also coming off two back to back record years. But I think that the Biden administration has opportunities for us. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see stimulus but we'll see. And I think that there's also an opportunity perhaps in the new administration for some bipartisan support for potentially an infrastructure bill, which I think foundationally would serve us well. In terms of state and local and video… So Tim, just to kind of decompose your two questions, number one, in terms of our fixed video government sales, we're really pleased with the progress. If you remember when we acquired Avigilon, it was essentially a nascent business and very strong growth. In fact, fixed video growth in 2020 was north of 45% so we like that. That feels good. We also acquired Pelco. And I think it's important to point out that Pelco gave us federal government contractual mechanisms with which to sell upon and we enjoyed that, those contracts in 2020. So we feel good about that but more importantly, where we're going moving forward in 2021. With respect to mobile video, actually, we had a very strong year. If you look at the second half of the year, both Q3 and Q4, orders for body cams were up for us over 60% in both respective quarters. Fundamentally, what we're hearing from our customer base is customers want an alternative. I think with our market reach, our go to market coverage, our channels, I think we've got a reach to start to get into suburban rural municipalities as well, which is where we're going to start seeing the next level of decisions.
The other piece of it that we haven't talked much about was we acquired a company called Edesix through our Avigilon acquisition. We had two international wins of over $1 million last year. And again, we think we're well set for the international market. The last thing and I think that really ties it all together and Greg hit it on the script is we're obviously launching a new digital evidence management platform this year with CommandCentral Evidence. We've got a differentiator and that our body worn and how mobile video flows ties into our full workflow with CAD mobile records and are obviously digital evidence management. So we're excited. We think we're well poised for the body worn space as well. And the next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Greg, I just wanted to start, on the last call, you called 2021 a growth year for both segments. I know you didn't specifically guide, but there's some perception that you are comfortable with street estimates. You have strong backlog. I think currency moved your direction but now today guiding below street estimates. So is this just a case where we were off in terms of the street, or is there anything that gives you maybe a little bit more conservatism now versus 90 days ago? As I mentioned 90 days ago, I did expect us to forecast growth in 2021 and that's what we're doing. I do feel, Adam, pretty good about the growth overall but also by segment and the respective technologies and the theaters. I think that we'll grow products in mid single digit. We expect to grow Software and Services in low double digit. The backlog position, as you referenced, serves us well. I think the fact of the matter is we're still early days in February and still in the middle of a pandemic. Things are incrementally getting better. And we're still operating at this point, Adam, with some supply constraints and limitations. Now the demand signals are stronger than the current supply constraints that we have. So that's also informing our guidance and we think given the overall environment, is probably a prudent thing to do at this point in time. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out. And just as a follow-up, I wanted to maybe paint a narrative and have you respond to it. Right now, it seems like the body worn camera market is becoming increasingly important to the customer base. And wondering how this impacts the share of wallet opportunity within the customer base for follow on products? Because the investor concern is that you're known for LMR leadership, not necessarily known for body worn camera leadership. And as this becomes more important, perhaps it's a better opportunity for your competitor to upsell their software suite. So I think you kind of understand the narrative there. I'd just be curious, your comments on that and how you would potentially debunk that. No. I mean, look, I think the body-worn video area is a great opportunity. I think historically, it's been served by one provider. Now there's a more compelling viable choice as an alternative in Motorola Solutions. I think Jack referenced the strong order activity that he saw in Q3 and Q4. I think that serves us well. We also think the integration of body worn video and evidence management into the command center, given our incumbency and strong position across the different modules that broaden the whole suite and command center software, I like that position. And look, I also think we can grow internationally with body worn camera. And at the end of the day, the body worn video addressable market, we think, is about $500 million all in with body worn camera and evidence management. I think we have a great opportunity to take share and be a competitive compelling number two. But I also like the fixed video and access control addressable market being a multiple of that. Without China, we think it's about $15 billion. So there's a lot of room to run across the technologies, inclusive of body worn. But I think historically, that market has been served by one provider. Yes. And the only other thing I'd add on that, Greg, we don't think it's one or the other. As we said before, they all need to have technologies. Do you need body cams for accountability? Yes, without a doubt. And we've seen our growth over 60% both Q3 and Q4. But if you look at our performance from an LMR perspective, it was big deals like Nassau and New Jersey. But quite frankly, Q4 from a grassroots perspective, which we track was our strongest Q4 in five years. And so we think there's certainly opportunities on both ends of the spectrum and we think wallets won't be constrained, wallets will open up for more technology. And the next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. I guess I was curious about some of the comments on record backlog. Was there anything unusual about the order book this quarter? Was there an Airwave contract extension, for example, anything sizable in terms of the order book? So we saw strong orders across the board, North America we highlighted being a record. We talked about some rather large orders, Nassau County, some utilities summing to $50 million. But as Jack just mentioned, our grassroots, which is smaller deals, transactional type deals were also up significantly. So across the board type deal activity in North America, complemented also by international with renewal of managed services in EMEA and a new contract award for the State of Tasmania in Australia. So I'd say across the board in both theaters, strong orders performance. And then just as a follow-up, you guys seem to be talking a lot more about LMR services. And I know managed services in general have been a push for the company, but just based on your commentary, it seems like there's a positive inflection there. Is that the right perception to have and can you talk more about what's intuitively driving that? Thanks a lot. On the Services, we've been pleased with the performance of Services. In particular, it demonstrates the resiliency of the recurring revenue business that we've built in Software and Services. In particular, as we look at 2020 and going into 2021, North America Services has been growing, so is international. We have expanded our service offering. We are now pushing a bit more into cybersecurity as well, which is a very, very attractive area that continues to be a focus amongst municipalities. But I think that the Services business, as we look at it, continues to operate at a steady pace. As Jason just highlighted, we had a number of good orders, managed service orders internationally that either extended existing networks that we had or also added on new ones like the Tasmania transaction that we just discussed. So the Services business continues to be something that demonstrates also the resiliency of LMR and the demand for that, because we see our customers continue to renew the contracts that they have at increased rates and on time, which is a very positive indicator of both the compelling nature of our services but also the importance of LMR. Also, the investments we're making on the product side of LMR to advance the networks continue to get more complex and connecting them the cloud with Cirrus will continue to provide opportunities to grow our managed services offer in and around those new products. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. I guess dissecting the larger orders that came in, in the fourth quarter, again. Perhaps you can provide a little more color if you can in terms of what's the primary driver that you're seeing from your customers? Is it really the large guys versus small guys? Is it new offerings that are allowing the contracts at a higher price? I guess, is there any two or three things that are primary drivers of those large orders now? So a few things. As you can imagine, part of this was we had, I would say, our engagement with customers, particularly in Q2, was slightly impaired. So we saw obviously the velocity of those engagements improve in the second half. But the other thing that I think we're going to start to see, particularly as it relates to Nassau County, which was one of the big deals that we cited in our script, was a mix to the APX NEXT, which we announced in October of 2019. Is that obviously come at an ASP appreciation for us? It does. But I think more importantly, as you look throughout the portfolio, you look at what Kelly has brought to market in command center software. You look at what we're doing from a PCR perspective. Just this week, we announced a category changer in the ion device, which combines a legacy PCR device but also does private LTE and CBRS in one device. And so we think some of the investments we've made from an R&D perspective on device refresh, on converging devices and those experiences will continue to provide kind of an upgrade, upsell opportunity for our customers. We think more to follow into 2021. Yes. I mean, Keith, I agree. And at the end of the day, we said things would improve sequentially in the back half of 2020 as sales engagement improved. I think that was a driver. I think there has been pent up demand and exactly what Jack just said. Even during a COVID year, I can't remember this number of new products that we invested in, in 2020. Yes, we managed discretionary expenses down. Yes, we didn't have travel incentives. We had a benefit on expenses. But at the same time, whether it was APX NEXT, a new TETRA device, Ion for PCR, cloud enabled modules in command center, refreshing the video security suite, we made a conscious effort to invest organically in product development. And I think that strong Q4 in part is because of some of those new products. Our whole intent was not only to come out of COVID but come out stronger than we went in. And I think Kelly and Jack particularly have done a great job on prioritizing new products and investments. And the thing we failed to mention just internationally as we start to see our momentum grow there is the MXP600, which was really the first major TETRA device announcement. And quite frankly, we were oversubscribed for that in Q4. We took as many orders we could ship. So we're happy with that too. And just follow-up a question from earlier here. Cybersecurity, I know you guys have made several small acquisitions in that space. Can you provide a little bit more color about what the plan is for cybersecurity? Is it cybersecurity related to the networks or is it beyond that for public safety agencies? I guess, what's your goal? So the cybersecurity services that we offer right now and the ones that we also expanded last year with a couple of acquisitions will focus around monitoring, in incident resolution and helping our customers understand the risk profile of what they have installed both in their command center and in their LMR networks. So our initial focus is on those core areas that we provide our products around, specifically the LMR networks, as I said, in the command center. We'll look to expand to their critical networks that they may need to manage their operations. So it's pretty focused right now but something that our customers are very interested in because those are obviously the most critical assets that they need to protect and make sure they're always up and running. And the next question will be from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. You formally launched the command center in the cloud, PremierOne platform in October. I was wondering, have adoption trends and performance lived up to your internal expectations? And as a follow up to that, is the pandemic stimulating the shift to your PremierOne platform from your on-premise customer base? On that question, the answer is yes. It's definitely stimulated, the interest in the cloud. I think everybody from consumers all the way to government have learned the importance of cloud and the ability to operate remotely. We accelerated our efforts to drive more and more of our command center to the cloud. You'll continue to see us expand more to the cloud even this year. It is one of the faster growing areas in our portfolio. We're getting a lot of interest in regards to conversations with our customers. As you know, those buying cycles are somewhat long so you'll hear more and more about that in the future. I would highlight, just as we talk about our command center growth, our SaaS revenue growth as a component of our command center, is growing at a multiple of our overall command center software growth. So that's a good indication that we're seeing more and more customers show interest and transition towards that type of model. And related to what you just said, I know you have CAD, mobile and records on the PremierOne platform and you also spoke about SaaS. You previously indicated that you plan to offer 911 call taking in the cloud in the first half of 2021. Is that initiative still on track? That's correct and yes, it is. That is definitely another component, that's the final and the last component that we need to add to the cloud. And the next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. First off, before I ask my question, I just want to clarify. Jason, did I hear you say that PCR was $763 million for the year? PCR, no. But PCR was down about $300 million from last year. That was the decline that we saw in 2020. So I'll make that my first question. So I think I remember you and Greg saying that you all were expecting about $350 million or 35% decline for the year. It sounds like it wasn't that much different but somewhat better. My question to you, my first question is, is that reflective of a stronger -- I assume it means you had a stronger Q4 than you're expecting. And the real question is looking forward, what is your expectations for the pace of recovery, given how hard 65% of the revenue in PCR was hit? Are you seeing that actually come back faster than you expected? What's your expectation for the year? So Paul, you're right. Q4 was better than we anticipated in PCR. So for the full year, as Jason just mentioned, it was down about $300 million. We had signaled it could be about $350 million, so a slight improvement. We do think it will continue to improve in 2021. And in fact, at this point, overall, I think our expectation is that it can grow. Now it will be incrementally as a number of different key verticals like transportation, airline, hospitality, oil and gas as they improve. But 2020 was pretty draconian. I look at it as more or less a floor, and our expectation is for PCR to return to growth in 2021. Now having said that, we still have to operate and execute on that against the supply constraints and limitations that are in front of us. But as we've started out the year in 2021, it's a good start. My second question is looking at video and your command center software, and I appreciate you all giving the breakout. I think that's great. My question here is, in video, if I look at the numbers correctly, you put up -- it almost double in calendar '19, another almost 30% growth in calendar '20. Obviously, that was helped by the many acquisitions you've made. And then in command center software, you had about 30% year-over-year growth in calendar '19, albeit less than 10% growth in calendar '20, I assume, impacted by the pandemic. In those two particular product markets that represent a significantly greater growth opportunity for you, are you seeing a step-up in organic growth? If we look beyond the pandemic in terms of the trends, especially on the software side of video but taking the two together, are you seeing a step-up in organic growth? So within the technologies you're referring to, the growth expectations for video security are to be up high teens this year and command center software to return to 20% growth like measures which you mentioned on some of the lookback into 2019 and 2018 as we get beyond the pandemic impact, and that LMR would be up mid single digits. Those are the expectations for '21 from a technology standpoint. The next question is from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. If you could help me understand in terms of -- I understand it's a difficult question to answer. But can you give us a rough idea on the average life of the devices in the field? I suspect you have a new product that you launched last year or year before. So maybe you can give us some indication as to when we can expect to see some meaningful upside from a device refresh perspective. So we've seen -- historically, five, six, seven years ago, people would hold the device for 10 years. The refresh cycle now looks more like six to seven years for a device. And can you give us some indication as to where the average life of the devices are in the field today and how the adoption of the new APX NEXT device is going? And should we expect meaningful pressure on an upgrade cycle maybe in the near term or within the next 12 months? So obviously, within the US and globally, there's so many municipalities, law enforcement. But the one thing that I would say is that we've looked over history, the XTS family, the APX family, we typically get three to five years until the revenue becomes very meaningful, and so we're 2.5 years in. We feel like we've got a great amount of refresh cycle, both with the APX NEXT and then internationally with their MXP600 device. And I'd add, in our product cycles, we run concurrent devices, both the old and the new so that we continue to sell both. It's not a consumer like where you switch from one to the other. So customers expect the device to be available for some time. And then, of course, the new device as it becomes more feature-rich and compelling, leads to a transition point. The next question will be from Sami Badri with Crédit Suisse. So I kind of just wanted to cover something that I don't think has been touched on, on this conference call or in the prepared remarks. It's referring to the Hytera litigation. We didn't get an update in January of 2021. I was hoping if we could just kind of go through the latest that you guys have heard from the ongoing litigation and whether or not the actual 2021 guidance includes any contribution or award contribution from that litigation outcome. So Sami, the guidance for full year 2021 does not contemplate any award or anticipated monetary settlement. What I would say is our engagement and pursuit legally of Hytera is unwavering and relentless. The court recently kind of recalculated the compensatory and punitive judgment to a number, I think it's $544 million, is the recalculated federal court award, but it doesn't change the fact that Hytera stole. They sold trade secrets. They infringed and they infringed on copyright source code. So that's unchanged. And having said that, we expect the current damages award again, I think it's $544 million, we expect that to increase after a court applies a pre and post trial interest as well as a compulsory royalty going forward. So stay tuned. We continue to pursue. It will remain front and center, nothing more important than protecting our intellectual property. But none of what I described is reflective of the numbers we talked about today. And then the other thing I want to talk about more of a Motorola strategic perspective, is on prior calls, we've talked about you going after acquisitions and targets. I'm sorry if it was mentioned earlier on this call, and I'm essentially just repeating questions already asked. But what is the appetite of Motorola to go out and do same number of deals in 2021 comparable to 2020? Is there appetite for that right now or are you guys in digestion mode? I think there's appetite and there's capacity. But if you take a step back, my priority is investing organically in the business. We have great markets. The technologies of land mobile radio, mission critical communications, all the trends around modernizing 911 and command center software and of course, all things video, fixed video and access control, as well as body worn, but these are big addressable markets, in combination approaching $40 billion of an addressable market, that's probably 3x greater than it was for this company five years ago or so.
So prioritizing new products, and investments, by the way, an investment like the global manufacturing facility for fixed video in Richardson, Texas, to give us better scale, better capacity, lower unit cost. Jack talked about APX NEXT. He talked about TETRA. He talked about PCR. You know we're investing in the cloud. And by the way, we also bought back stock at attractive rates. We look at the long range plan. We do the DCF. We look at where we think this stock is attractive to buy back and we've been active on that front as well. $612 million of share repurchase last year, $289 million of acquisitions. And we did another double digit raise on dividend of 11% of $436 million. So yes, we continue to scan acquisition opportunities. There will probably be more around video security, software and services. But I think we've been good stewards of capital. We'll continue to be responsible on that front. But we like the prospects both organically and inorganically. [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Can we start looking at this Ion device specifically, how incremental is that product relative to what's been out there historically? It looks to be higher-priced versus the previous high end turbo product. So I'm interested in the spread there. And then I'm also curious, any thoughts you have on -- does this product open up new addressable market, because it's got more features and multimode and capabilities? So does it have more use cases and it opens up some TAM? What's your perspective on that product and that line as it expands? Ben, we invested in the Ion because we believe we had an opportunity to create a new category. So some of the things that it does, obviously, when we make an engineering decision to include higher throughput mechanisms like private LTE, CBRS, we want to do though because we have an eye on a workflow that a customer application. So as an example, it does image capture. It does scanning. It does things that no radio that we've ever made for the PCR space has ever done. So fundamentally, that creates new opportunities. Think of things like warehousing, manufacturing, even there's hospitality, stadium security type applications. We also think, as Greg referred to Safety Reimagine, as we start to see our video opportunities, access control, merge with PCR opportunities, we think that kind of device plays well into that environment too. So again, it would be accretive to what we typically do. It redefines the PCR category. And my second question, just stepping back, Greg, when I look across the portfolio, you're really the only vendor who touches radio surveillance, command center with the breadth and the scope. Could you talk a little bit about the feedback from customers as you leverage that portfolio and just your long term aspiration to gain share in some of the markets where you're not as incumbent? Well, first of all, you're right. I don't think anybody else has the width and breadth of our portfolio. But our goal is to be the best and compelling across all three technologies. I mentioned the size of the addressable market. But I also think, and I referenced this a little bit in the opening remarks, I also think the special sauce is the integration of these technologies. Not only does not no one else have them but I think you're going to see us integrate them as well. Automated workflow, machine learning, AI powered analytics that allow -- I mean, there's volumes of video. And how do you see it, how do you watch it, how do you extract it, how do you redact it, how do you push it, to an incident to a dispatcher? And we're working not just having best in class point products for these technologies, and I like the hand of cards we're playing, but it's the orchestration and the integration led by our Chief Technology Officer, Mahesh Saptharishi, who's making great progress on the orchestration and integration.
So you think about the things that are going on, whether it's social unrest, wildfires, immigration, there's a lot of trends, socially and environmentally that I think are favorable. There's a lot of technology trends that I think are favorable. And as we've talked about consistently about the overarching purpose of our company, of helping people be their best in the moments, those critical, mission-critical, literally moments that matter, that's the envelope of our vision and the technologies that we invest and the integration that we're pursuing. And I think there's more room to run, to your point, outside of the United States in a number of international theaters and stay tuned for us to share some more things on that front as well. Next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Congratulations, and it's very encouraging, the backlog bookings outlook. Am I correct to say that, that does not include any potential government stimulus packages? Because it seems like whenever I read the online or watch the news, they're talking about stimulus packages, and maybe some of that comes to you or maybe it doesn't come to you. Or how should we think about -- are there anything potentially being talked about in stimulus that could actually take that number higher, or does it simply not filter into you guys? I'm just kind of curious about if anything there. Yes, Jim, I would say, remember, I mean, I think that engagements improved, new products getting traction, pent up demand, and we did have some benefit of CARES Act money, about $150 million in 2020 but also CARES funding is now extended through December of 2021. So there's a good level of continuity there. But you're right. I don't think as we describe the business and look at the visibility in terms of current demand signals, potential stimulus, potential infrastructure builds and things from Washington probably would be further enabling in some of the growth that we're expecting. The only other thing, Jim, that I'd piggyback on to what Greg said is that, obviously, the education space appears to be a place that there's going to be funding directed at and prioritized. What's really lost in the shuffle and lost in the noise is, I think, a pretty solid print in Q4 was what we've done with connected learning with our CBRS investment. We did close to $10 million in 2020 with some pretty major cities that those projects are a little bit like a snowball. They'll continue to grow. We’ll also pull through video opportunities and access control opportunities. So we think there could be some potential that in the education space as well. That's what I thought. And thank you and congratulations to your team for a strong 2020 and outlook for '21. This concludes our question and answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks. No further comments. Thanks for joining us today. And thank you.

The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; A - Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Software and Services.
Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And, with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings, and cash flow. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion up 8% versus last year. Additionally demand remains strong resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history.
Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were up 15% driven by growth across our LMR, video security, and command center software technologies and this segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year.
And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of 1.8 billion, up 7% including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million up $64 million or 18% and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.5% of sales, up from 21% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage, and lower legal fees partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year.
Non-GAAP EPS of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. Higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $455 million up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend.
Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year. The increasing cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q1 included 170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53 million, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of CapEx.
During the quarter, we entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility and subsequent to quarter-end the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program.
Moving to our segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2% primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints.
Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment, include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1.
$72 million of video sales with government customers up 32% from last year, a $37 million P25 upgrade for government agency in Canada, a $33 million TETRA upgrade for large customer in Europe and a $12 million P25 order with the large US Federal customer.
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security, and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million.
Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins in the segment, include $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee.
A $35 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year contract with a large US customer. A $22 million P25 and Push-to-Talk over broadband contract from a large Middle Eastern customer. $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple UK customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to-date.
A $5 million contract with St. Lucie Florida. Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V3100 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform. Looking at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% and growth in LMR, video security, and command center software.
International Q1 revenue of $588 million was up 9% with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac, and Latin America. The growth was driven by video security and LMR. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally.
Sequentially backlog was down $130 million driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset with international growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multi-year LMR services and command center software contracts in North America and $58 million of international software growth.
The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially backlog was down $269 million also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared up $318 million compared to last year primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions.
Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million driven by international LMR growth. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 per share and $1.95 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.
And for the full year we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8% and we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.70 per share and $8.80 per share up from our prior guidance of $8.50 per share to $8.62 per share.
This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Jason, thanks, and now I'd like to end with a few thoughts on the business. First, our results for the quarter were outstanding. We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings, and cash flow expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth.
Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year inclusive of the supply challenges that we have. We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program.
The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong and we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus up from the high teens we referenced on our last call. In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue.
Our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market. And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by one vendor.
During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins both in the US and internationally. Just this morning, we announced a $17.5 million contract to provide about 30,000 body-worn cameras to the French Ministry of Interior.
Additionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings. The integration of our V3100 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the US with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite.
And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand in the command center software, video security, and LMR services. Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher-growth areas up from 20% five years ago and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time.
And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin, and cash flow for the company.
And, with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and look forward to your questions. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is now open. Thank you. Two questions if I could both on the video business. Greg, could you talk a little bit, give us an update on how the move into more of the public safety verticals with all of the video offerings is going where are we in that process and how much traction you're seeing there. And then second maybe for Greg or Jack talk a little bit about the body-worn area. It does seem like you guys are seeing more traction there and making a little bit more of a focus. Can you talk a little bit about kind of go-to-market sales force push there and if you could just remind us also for that business how important and how meaningful is kind of the software on the back end of the actual body-worn camera sale? Thank you. Thanks, Tim. I'm pleased with the video security business in total. Both fixed video and mobile. I think Molloy and Kedzierski and the entire team has done a great job on investing in additional go-to-market, refreshing the product portfolio both in fixed video, body-worn camera, and mobile video. As I mentioned, also I think the secret sauce for us is to not just have great products in video, but also the integration and orchestration of that with the installed base that we have with thousands of LMR and PCR networks around the world. I'm thrilled with the progress in body-worn camera, both domestically and internationally. We had the big announcement this morning with the French Ministry of Interior. But we're taking share. We're clearly I think we've been doing that since late last year, the second half of 2020, and it's pretty clear as well that we're taking share and we took share in Q1 and Jack may want to talk about the progress in public safety as well which I'm pleased with. Sure. Yes. Just maybe one point to follow on top of Greg's. First of all, as it relates to body-worn. If you look at the data that was just released by our competitor Exxon and ourselves. They grew their shipment 16% in Q1 that 7,000 units in an absolute perspective whereby we grew body-worn shipments a 104%, which is 11,500 units. So I think that's indicative of the share we've taken. The second thing, Tim, I think you talked about in general our video business into government and if you remember that was a largely nascent business for us just a few years ago, will eclipse $300 million to start there, and I think that really plays on as Greg said both strength in fixed and mobile. And I think we stand at the intersection of two really important things, transparency and government efficiency. The last thing I'd close with is the American Rescue Plan puts us in play for multi-year tailwinds as it relates to incremental public safety spend, spend around education, we're fixing schools with both video security and access control as well. So, I feel good as Greg said just to reiterate a few of those points and add a little deeper, but feel good all-in on government. And, Tim, just on software, which is your last part of your question on what -- how that plays into it. This past quarter, you may have seen we announced our CC command central evidence platform, which is our new Azure-based cloud platform, which works seamlessly with all of our body-worn video to help manage the body-worn video and in-car video that comes in and that's important because it doesn't just work with our body-worn video, it also works seamlessly with the whole command center software suite that we have, evidence being managing the body-worn video, but it integrates seamlessly with the entirety of our records platform as well. So they all play together and work well together and we're making the investments across the board as Jack referenced on body-worn and of course also on the software that handles at the back end. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Tim. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to start obviously a very strong Q1, Greg, record backlog as I think on a forward basis, it seemed to be good conditions for the PCR business to continue to recover anything from stimulus might be incremental and then looking at the full-year guidance, the back half growth is around 5% year-over-year and it's more muted seasonality. Just seems like the environment might be healthier than normal from the macro standpoint. So maybe you could touch on the offsets that would cause more muted growth for the full year. And I recognize, I'm getting greedy, but I have to ask. No, Adam, look I think the environment is very healthy and the demand is very strong. I think that's indicated by the record Q1 that I outlined in a number of categories and the robustness and the strength of the backlog that we're exiting Q1 as well. Now having said that, right, if you look at first half, second half growth, obviously first half growth for us this year is very high. It's a bit distorted for us and other companies, given the Q2 pronounced COVID effect, but nonetheless, I'm very happy with what we did in Q1. I'm pleased with how we're guiding Q2 and I remind you, Adam, also 90 million of FX favorability is in the first half. It's more like 38 million to 40 million in the second half, but also as it relates to supply, we're still operating under the current environment, which is generally comparable to what it was when we talk to you a quarter ago. Although, I would point out, while it remains challenging, the team did a nice job working with some key suppliers pulling forward key components to execute and print Q1. They're also doing it again, which is informing and driving a very healthy guide in Q2. So while the supply environment remains challenging, we will look to continue on those improvements in the back half, but at this point in time, and given the fact that the pandemic is still there, which I thought it was a prudent guide. Understood. Makes sense. Just as a follow-up. I did want to ask, you touched on video, which is very healthy. I did want to ask on command center software. If I look in the slides correctly, I think that grew around 13% year-over-year, previously you had talked about a goal of 20%. So maybe just color on delta in the quarter, is this just lumpiness and I'm wondering how to think about growth rate of that moving forward. Do you think you'll catch up to that 20% or should we be thinking about attenuating that for now? Adam, it's Kelly. The answer is yes. We're still tracking to the 20%. We're pleased with the growth we got, the 30% in Q1, but as we come into the back half of the year, the growth rates associated with Q2 through Q4 will benefit from the softer comps of what we saw in 2020 on COVID impact and not to mention the other thing is we have some very large NGCS deals, which we won last year that will start contributing revenue in the back half of the year. So going to the approximately 20% is something that we are still targeting. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry, I mean, problem with my phone. Maybe if we could just spend a second on just any -- you mentioned you're having good -- you're mitigating supply chain issues, but just whether any overhang on margins. And just some of these stimulus plans are being rolled out, what do you think will be the cadence of -- are you seeing kind of front-loaded investment as the stimulus funds like backloaded investment or do you think it will be more mitigated throughout the year? Yes, Meta. So as we look kind of at the full year and from a margin perspective for the company, from a gross margin standpoint. I think they will be comparable maybe slightly up and that includes probably the gross margin profile for the segments as well products as well as software and services. If you take operating margins, we're now anticipating operating margin expansion in software and services to be up about 140 basis points. That's an increase from what we've talked about a quarter ago by 40 basis points and we expect product segment operating margins to grow as well more commensurate with volume. In terms of the demand environment, I think, it's partially pent-up demand. I think things are reopening as the pandemic depending upon the geography relieves itself and the economy starts to get back into a strong rhythm of expansion. From a stimulus standpoint, there is a lot of money available to our customers, particularly on the public safety side both around the CARES Act, which was already in place for 2020 and continues on through 2021 as well as the American Rescue Plan, which is new available money in the Biden $1.9 trillion Plan. There is $350 billion for state and local funding. There is a $170 billion for school funding. There is $38 billion for airports and transit. There is a lot of money. The other important thing is that these funds are available for about the next 3 years to 3.5 years. So our customers will have available grant money, the environments remaining strong and gets stronger in public safety. The PCR business on the enterprise side grew at 8% in Q1 and we are reaffirming its growth all in for this year. So I like the position we're in and I like the signals we're seeing. One thing I'd add on the input costs. We're not seeing measurable increases on inputs. The one area where we've had to navigate is higher freight costs and moving things to the ocean off of what had been freight, air freight, which are very high. So that's leading to slightly higher inventory for the time being, but we'll navigate through those but as Greg said more opportunities there. Great, thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Can you talk about your strategy for the education vertical and what you are seeing there in terms of demand? Sure. Louie, hi, it's Jack. The education vertical, it's interesting, because Greg just talked about the American Rescue Plan. There is $170 billion directed to school funding that runs through September 23. So we've really got a duality of opportunities with education. The biggest opportunity we have with education is in our fixed video, security, and access control business. Simply put, it's been one of our highest growing verticals in that business. We not only have a regional sales team, but we have a group of business development vertical specialists that focus and work out with schools on directing funding in those kind of things. So we're really pleased there, but we also work and do -- we have a safety reimagine campaign going on that actually pulls together fixed video security and PCR and that message resonates very well. So think about you get an intrusion on a door access control, sends a signal to a PCR radio whereby every teacher might have one and the level of security that enhances that schools has been impressive. And I think resonates with our customers. So we're really excited actually in my career here this is probably the best opportunity set we've had in education. And, Louie, the other key around that is in addition to what Jack said, think automation, think analytics, think integration. So as the Motorola Solutions Critical Infrastructure on fixed video, mobile video, land mobile radio, perimeter detection, backpack, delinquent student, inappropriate trucking on a parking lot. All of that would be automated. As Jack said not only sends an alert to the radio, but also can automatically alert in command central aware, a 911 dispatch operator as well. So we're leveraging the installed base capitalizing on the new fixed video architecture targeting safe schools and integrating and automating all of the technology we have to differentiate in an offering that we don't think anyone else can provide. Great. So it's not just Avigilon, it's the broad suite of products. Exactly. You're bundling with the analytics and I think you mentioned the PCR radios as well. Got you. Yes, and our CTO Mahesh who came with us to -- from us to the -- from the acquisition of Avigilon to Motorola has been critical in the orchestration software work and integration work to make all these technologies seamlessly work together. Great. Yes I saw him give a presentation for your investment and Evolve technologies. Right. And with Evolve that gives us another investment around access control. We were in investor earlier probably a year or two ago with Evolve. We're committed to make a future investments. It's a little bit more consequential. And so when you think about critical infrastructure locations like schools or stadiums or airports or hospitals Evolve and that partnership around weapons detection is another interesting component to integrate into the suite as we develop our product portfolio and think about a differentiated operating going forward. Sounds good. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is now open. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the questions. First just a clarification. I apologize what you stated and I misheard, but Greg I think I heard you say that you're confirming growth for PCR for the full year, but I didn't hear what that growth was? We are confirming it for the full year, Paul. I mentioned that it grew 8% in Q1. We didn't give a specific number, but it wouldn't surprise me if the full year growth is generally commensurate with that kind of number, but I like the signals that are coming back from that business. All right. I'm glad to hear that I'm actually paying attention. So can you give a number, but it always encouraging. But on a serious note, any incremental insight you can give in terms of recovery where all we can read the paper and see in the news that oil and gas and transportation and hospitality were all reopening, there's talk about cruise ships eventually sailing although that hasn't happened yet. I trust you're seeing ongoing improvement and if I may a question for you on your video security in the public sector. So now that it's on a $300 million or over $300 million utilized run rate in a normal Geoffrey Moore crossing the chasm adoption cycle, one would expect or I would expect that to accelerate as that number becomes meaningful. And I don't know if that's a 300. I know you just said 20% up from 15% previously, but should we expect as time goes on you had further acceleration with the benefit of critical mass? Well, critical mass, Paul is certainly a benefit as we get greater density and it's kind of a nucleus for a flywheel of growth. We did raise our outlook today on the video security technologies all into 20% plus growth for fiscal 2021 up from high teens. I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate into 2022 necessarily. It's a little too early for that, but the markers are good. The momentum is good. The product portfolio is getting refreshed and the investments that are being made and we're taking share. We're taking share both in the fixed video component. We're taking share in the body-worn camera component. And I also believe that access control and the integration of access control with video security is also a nice opportunity for us as it relates to the individual enterprise verticals that are recovering from PCR perspective maybe Jack can provide a little bit on that front. Yes. So internationally those markets have still been slow to rebound. We have seen, I would say, very measured and slight improvements in oil and gas earlier this year really even in Q4 last year, we started to see some recovery. Hospitality in general is still slow. I would say in the Southeast and through the Southwest, it's a little better, but it's still been slow, we think those things will improve in Q2 into Q3. And just thread the two points on growth. Last year's video business for us in total was $926 million, that's the business that we're talking about growing at 20% plus in this year of '21. Jack's comments earlier were about the 300 million of that, that's anticipated this year to be from specifically government, and that's a part of the business that was very nascent just three or four years ago and was part of our thesis in penetrating the Avigilon portfolio into our legacy accounts and we're doing that. Understood. I appreciate the responses. Thanks, Paul. Your next question comes from the line of Kyle McNeely from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Kyle on for George Notter. Thanks a lot for the question. This is somewhat similar to the video question you just answered, but you talked about some of the recovering verticals, but can you talk a little bit about the verticals that are driving that growth for you to take it up from high teens to 20%. There's a lot of the government, I would assume, but is there other enterprises, retail, schools. I believe you mentioned there's casinos, hotels and then is the international play here too or just the US. Could you kind of give us some clarity on how you're playing internationally and how that's doing versus domestic? Thanks. Yes. So for fixed video, the growth drivers really fundamentally been through the first part of this year is North America. We talked about North America, go-to-market coverage, that's paid big dividends. I would also tell you internationally every theater grew. We've done a really nice job in growing international key accounts, that's also a growth driver, and we start to think about from a technology standpoint, it's really been driven by a strength in analytics refresh, camera refreshes and I'd have to hit it again, but the government vertical as well as education continue to be a benefit not only Avigilon, but also the Pelco acquisition, which have helped us in the federal government's leave as well. Okay, great. And then it's also nice to hear some recovery in the PCR business. I'm wondering if you could comment about the trajectory past this year and whether you have line of sight to when it might recover to the $1 billion run rate, it was pre-COVID. Is that a little too far off to predict or can you give us kind of a timeframe on when you might get back to that previous run rate? Well, I would just say this, it is probably too early to predict on that front, but through Q1 and actually quarter-to-date from an orders and bookings standpoint, the trend is very good. Now I'm not going to declare an endpoint of when we return to that level, but I would simply say it's certainly ahead of the expectations that we had a quarter ago when we had the full-year view. And I'd also say, even though we're operating in a supply constrained environment, our channel partners have done a good job, managing this and handling and balancing the inventory levels that they hold to satisfy their customers, but the signals are strong, certainly stronger, I thought they would be good for PCR as you heard me say I thought PCR would return to growth in 2021. We're off to a very good start, orders are strong, and they're probably ahead of my expectations of where we are as we sit here in May, but we'll update you again in August, but it's very good. The other encouraging sign is that we saw a good product launch in Ion and a good reception from that very important part of the portfolio that was released recently and seeing good take rates. And the only other thing, Jason, I'd piggyback on that is also we've talked about our distance learning. We talked about monies that have been available for broadband investments and schools are investing in distance learning. We've talked about four big school districts last year. We've replicated that in Q1 and there continue to be a drumbeat of interest and a lot of those upgrades happen during the summer months. So we're actually very excited about our private LTE, Nitro solution as well. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. This is Trevor filling in for Keith. With the American Rescue Plan, you mentioned earlier that customers will have access to that money for the next few years. Have you seen any impact yet on the sales pipeline or is it too early? Yes, we have. It's a really good question. We've seen the team -- kind of a -- in a joking way, but you give salespeople and pass the money good salespeople and they go find it and we've had discussions already public safety engagements right away for the state and local funding we've been engaged with schools, but also airports and transits when they've had a little bit of downtime, they're doing some planning as well. Now that they know they've got funding available. Okay, great. And maybe a quick follow-up. How would you characterize the sales cycle? Has that returned to normal yet or not so much? I would say the sales cycle here as we sit in 2021, I would caveat it, in North America, it's largely return to normal, both in terms of government and in terms of our PCR business, which is focused in the enterprise. Europe has been very slow. Borders are still slow down. A lot of it's virtual. Parts of Asia return back to normal and COVID is running through Latin American and things and engagements very slow there, but in North America things have returned very much close to normal. Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Thanks, Trevor. Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from MKM Partners. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned supply chain couple of time. Was there any impact to your current quarter from component shortages and how much of your outlook is impacted by component shortages. Can you provide some quantification? And I have a follow up. Yes, Fahad. Yes, there was an impact and a constraint on Q1's results from a supply chain standpoint. It's a very small number of suppliers currently. It's primarily LMR. As I mentioned earlier. And while the environment is for the most part unchanged. It has incrementally improved in working with these suppliers to get some additional units for Q1, although we had demand that was stronger than what we could supply in Q1 and we have the supply chain team here is also made some good improvements for Q2 as well. How about the outlook? Is the outlook -- how much of your guide is baking in some headwinds from component shortages? Definitely. Our full year eight to nine guide absolutely incorporates the current supply constraints. Without them, it would be higher, but again I think we'd have a stronger second half in an unconstrained environment, but we're working through it. We made improvements in Q1. We are making improvements in Q2, which in part informs the 19% to 20% strength of guide and there is work for us to do in Q3 and Q4 and we'll update you again in August. Okay. My other question I wanted to dive into the fixed video opportunity outside of the United States. Your two largest Chinese these competitors Hikvision and Dahua have been pretty much implicated in running concentration camps in China. To what extent are you beginning to now see meaningful wins in Hikvision and Dahua footprint. And can you provide some quantification. I appreciate that video is growing overall, but how much of it is coming from share gain against these two large suppliers? Well, you're right, and I know you asked an international question, but in the National Defense Authorization Act, both those companies are named by name about not having any fixed video deployments and government agencies are and certainly also not being eligible for any federal grant money. It's also Fahad important to remind everybody. We are clear-eyed about the opportunity in the addressable market here which we characterize is about 15 billion or 16 billion and that's zeroing out China, zero. We expect zero fixed video sales in China. I know that Hikvision and Dahua will continue to be the indigenous providers in country. But I think with the NDAA-compliance and the concern around those two vendors in critical security implementations that clearly has a favorable impact as well in other parts of Europe and Western democracies. So I think it's a tailwind. It is. Greg I think you said it well and I would just say within Europe I think there is a great deal of skepticism. Around Hikvision and Dahua right now I would say that also travels into the Middle East and into Australia, we've got significant opportunities and to answer your question directly, we've displaced Dahua and Hikvision on gaming opportunities in the Middle East. IndigoVision, we acquired IndigoVision, if you remember last year, they were the inverse of what we did in Pelco as well where they have better international footprint. We've brought that footprint into our fixed video business and we've been really, really pleased with work they've done to get us in the Middle East, certain parts of Europe, but we had some softness with Avigilon. So again I think international is a market that's going to ramp well for us. I appreciate the answers. Thank you. Thanks, Fahad. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to hit back an earlier question. Specifically, when you look at ARPA, could you talk a little bit about how that stimulus money, how do you think it might influence customers willingness to adopt newer technologies such as surveillance or command center. And then how does stimulus money specifically influence the sales cycle, which I think historically or a bit longer in public sector, does it shrink that sales cycle, any impacts there and then I have a follow-up? Yes, Ben, so let's start with this. We have a selling process that looks at every technology we make, every government agency or every enterprise decision makers that we have, and we do it really a three-dimensional view in any account. We are continually talking about not only our core technologies, but our emerging technologies with those customers. So in the mind of a customer, you first of all have to identify a need. The second thing is really how do you fund it. So you asked a question. What is the ARP plan done? It's alleviated a lot of concerns around visibility to money. And so in that sense in some ways it's never easy to make a sale, but in a lot of ways it clears up one of the biggest obstacles to sale, the great news is albeit that there is some of the deadlines on this funding, go all the way out to 2024. The reality is that there is no reason, there is no prohibition to spend that money earlier. So our sales team obviously has had many, many years at this with funding and we can provide different incentives et cetera to get customers to move faster if that may be the case, but just knowing they have visibility to that money I think provides a very good environment for us. Awesome. Thanks, Jack. Greg, one for you. Lots of encouraging things backlog, stimulus, the recovery as a whole. I got some region a little bit, but any perspective on the former $9 billion in revenue at $10 in EPS framework that you talked about? No. No perspective on that yet, Ben, but again you know how we printed Q1 and I referenced a whole litany of different records we've had and that's fine, right, but I don't really care about that in terms of what needs to be done today and tomorrow. It's important in that its foundational and its momentum and this is some of the strongest momentum I've seen in a long time. We have to deliver, we got to execute, we have to navigate supply challenges. There is always a lot to do, but I'm really proud of everybody here on the team. Everybody knows their role. There is no confusion about what we're trying to do and between the deployment of capital organically and inorganically and there remains some interesting inorganic opportunities. It's all about driving sustained shareholder value creation. And I don't mean to sound corny, but I think generally we've been good stewards of capital. We have the expansion to the share repurchase program although that doesn't -- that's we did that because the previous program was running out, but the capital allocation framework that we think about 50% for acquisitions and share repurchase and 30% for dividend and 20% for CapEx in a normalized balance sheet continues. So stay tuned for the opportunities in front, but we're looking to, and by the way, it's not just about 2021. I want to make sure that we continue this momentum in 2022 and beyond. So lots more work to do, but I like the cards we have. Thanks for the perspective. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Hi, thank you. Unfortunately, I'm going to go back to the supply shortage and component shortage conversation and maybe I was hoping, could you give us an idea on the number of suppliers who are working with that are actually supply constrained and have they given you guys essentially a counts and weeks in terms of what lead times you are looking at. Are they 30, 40 or they 50 weeks across some of the most important components for radios some of other products you guys have? So it's a handful of, first of all, the category is semiconductor. As a general category I'm sure that's not a surprise to you, Sami. It's about three or four vendors really that we're working with. We are doing detailed planning with them by week and by months. We regularly weekly go through the allocation necessary for us to meet demand as we balance what to fulfill and what not to. Again it's primarily LMR and I'm engaged with all of those vendors and I have to say they're responding pretty well. I don't want to get over our skis, but they were pretty good in Q1, helping us pull forward some incremental units, and they've been helpful, particularly one supplier that comes to mind. I won't name, but they've been great and the CEO has been an excellent partner and he has been accessible and I call him on his cell phone and he calls me and we talk regularly. He has been excellent and his team is really good and they're helping us through Q2 as well. And we know what work needs to be done in the back half, but at the end of the day, we just want to be prudent about the full year guide and while there is so many strong signals. We'll go a quarter as we go and we'll update you again in August. Got it. Thank you. And then one question for Kelly and this is a little bit tied to the America's Rescue Plan. Now, when you're working with the first responders, now they're looking to deploy or finally integrates sophisticated command center offerings with the modules and more of an end-to-end solution. Does the America's rescue plan allow these customers to go bigger and wider and it's more expensive on the number of modules and solutions they're deploying in their own organizations? The general answer on that is, yes. It is allocated there. They'll have to apply for it. The one area in particular that will get touched on that is the NGCS component, which is the fundamental 911 database backbone, which as you know is a new and growing area of our business that we are participating in now. So you're going to see a lot of applications for the NGCS component to start building on enhanced 911 call centers, which we think then will also drive additional churn of the 911 software base around that have enhanced software to really harvest the multimedia that will come through the NGCS stuff. Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Sami. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. Your line is now open. Thank you. And first I want to say you and your team for having a great strategy and executing on the operations during such a very difficult time the past year, year and a half. As we look forward with the government stimulus on the customer who about to come in and enter into the market and as you mentioned it's multi-year, it seems like it's going to impact many parts of your business, which parts are kind of going to be the most material and kind of timing of those. Is it more like stationary cameras first and then software second, but it seems like the software, the cameras won't really work without all the software, and it seems like it kind of all touches each other. So I'm just trying, I'm wondering about where you see the biggest opportunity from these government programs as they start to come out in the next few years? So if you think about the three technology groups that we report is a subline item. I first of all say given that it's not only state and local funding, but there's educational funding and airports and transits. I would dimensionalize fixed video is likely the biggest beneficiary of the American Rescue Plan. Follow quickly by command center software and then LMR upgrades as well as services, it will be addressed and attached to namely the state and local budget line. So, Jim, those will be the primary beneficiaries. And I would say there are 1A with the secondary groups is being 1B command center software and LMR and services. Great. Thanks so much and again congratulations to you and everyone at your company. Thank you, Jim. There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks.

[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Products, Sales and Services; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Senior Vice President and CTO, Software Enterprise and Mobile Video. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q2 was an outstanding quarter. We grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year. Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog, up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2.
Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter. In Products and Systems Integration, revenue was up 24% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies. And in Software and Services, revenue was up 19%, and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission-critical integrated ecosystem.
And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22%, including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX. GAAP operating earnings were $370 million, and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, inclusive also of higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage, a lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. OpEx in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation-related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year. These increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million, and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.
Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million. Operating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales, up from 13.5% in the prior year on higher sales and improved operating leverage, inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include, a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State Police, a $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the U.S., a $30 million P25 order from MARTA in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 devices order for a large U.S. state and local customer and a $5 million video security order, our largest single fixed video order from a U.S. federal customer to date.
Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million. Operating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation-related incentives this year.
Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include an $18 million French MOI body-worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with a U.S.-based customer, a $10 million P25 multiyear services extension for Ohio's statewide network, and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the U.S. federal customer. Additionally, we launched CommandCentral suite, public safety's first cloud-native 911 case -- call to case closure solution.
Looking at our regional results, North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q2 revenue was $659 million, up 25%, also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID-19.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $11.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally. Sequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN, partially offset with growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts. And sequentially, backlog was down $130 million driven, again, primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was up $484 million compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.09 and $2.14 per share. This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share. This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call. First, our results for the quarter were excellent. We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well.
Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second, in video security, demand remains strong. We've continued investing in this area even during the early days of the pandemic, and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we're now seeing from our customers.
Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions. Openpath is disrupting the access control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market. As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue disaggregation from video security and analytics to now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future video and access control convergence. And finally, as I look to the second half of the year, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses. In LMR, customers are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our APX NEXT device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements.
 In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go-to-market footprint to drive continued strong growth. And with respect to ESG, we've recently released our 2020 corporate responsibility report, which highlights our strategy and performance. Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes who named us as one of the best employers for diversity, and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies.
I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission-critical solutions that create value for employees, customers, communities and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions]
Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Long from Barclays. Maybe just 2 if I could. First, could you touch a little bit on the command center software side? Maybe just give us a little update on how you're penetrating the PSAPs and how the kind of the suite sales are going with more than 1 or 2 software modules to the customer base.
And then second, on the video side, it looks like there's been a lot of traction and wins internationally on the body-worn side. Can you talk a little bit about the U.S. market where, I guess, over the next few years, maybe there'll be more bids coming up. So could you just talk a little bit about how you could further penetrate the U.S. market there. Yes. On command center software, we continue, Tim, to make good progress. Our growth rate in Q2 increasing over Q1, the penetration of new customers also continues to expand. From a suite standpoint, I think the number of customers in Q2 ordering the suite is comparable to about the 25% we stated last time a quarter ago, but we continue to make solid progress on multiple fronts on the command center software slide. And overall, I think I'm pretty pleased. Tim, it's Jack. Maybe just a follow on to that. I think the other thing as it relates to command center software, just from an environmental standpoint, I think there's some excitement, both with our sales teams and our customer engagement just in terms of our -- we have an on-prem solution and we actually have a path to the cloud for customers. And I think being able to meet them for where they want to be will be effective for us. So that -- just closing off on that with command center software. Mobile video, just a couple of updates there, Tim, with the body-worn business. So we had talked -- the previous 3 quarters that we had grown our orders north of 60%. We actually grew north of 80%. Tim, we doubled our body-worn camera shipments through the first half of the year over the first half of 2020, and it looks like from the data we've looked at and it's just early what's in, but it looks like we continue to take share through Q2. Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. I have 2 questions. Greg, first and maybe, Jack. Could you give us an update on PCR and how much that contributed to your very high growth rate in LMR in the quarter? And then the second question is, I was hoping you could kind of give us more color on Openpath and how much revenues it contributed to the business. And was Openpath profitable before you guys acquired and started integrating? So in terms of PCR, I mean kind of taking a step back. Obviously, we've raised the full year again for the second time, Sami. If you look at this from a segment level, our performance is strong in both segments. Software and services is stronger. But also, we had a given color that we thought Product and SI would grow mid-single digits for the full year. Our raise is driven by Product and SI now being expected to grow mid- to high single digits for the full year. That stronger growth is driven primarily by video but also by LMR.
In Q2, PCR had a great quarter. Strong double-digit growth. But it's also the area, as Jason referenced, that's probably the most supply constraint. So if I think about, Sami, your question about expectations for PCR growth over the full year, I'd like to think about it as mirroring the mid- to high single digits for the Product and SI segment overall. Q2 was much stronger than that, but in the second half, we have to continue to navigate supply constraints, and that's informing our expectations and guidance for full year PCR.
On Openpath, it's not profitable. For the remainder of the year, full year, the stub revenue period, it's probably about $5 million of incremental revenue in the second half of this year, the last 5 months, and it's $0.05 dilutive. But having said that, I'm super excited by this acquisition. I think it's leading edge around cloud-based multifactor authentication access control. I love the products, I love the architecture, I love the management team and the leadership team. Mahesh was instrumental in guiding this along with Raj and John Kedzierski and couldn't be more pleased with it. I don't know if you want to mention anything, Mahesh, about it. Within the Avigilon portfolio, we've always had access control. Access control, in fact, has been one of the fastest-growing product portfolios within Avigilon. It is an on-prem solution. The on-prem solution connects to third-party leaders, controllers and panels as appropriate. Where Openpath is going is really a mobile-first approach and a cloud-native approach. The user experience that we see in the future for access control is one where authorized users never realize that the door is locked in the first place. It's frictionless, it is contactless. And from that standpoint, Openpath complements our Avigilon access control solution well. And together, I think we have a good solution going forward. And just last item on the revenue. You had asked it's about $0.05 dilutive to EPS this year and $5 million in revenue in the second half. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. This is Eric on for Meta. Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe sticking on some of the fixed video side. When we think about that large federal deal you won, are there other federal deals in the pipeline you're looking at now? Is that an area where demand is picking up with a lot of the federal funding and things we talked about last quarter. Just wondering on that. And then maybe if we could also talk about the enterprise side and if Openpath does -- open more opportunities in enterprise because it looked like their presence was probably stronger there. So anything on that. Sure. Eric, so I think the -- starting out -- are there -- yes, question, are there more big opportunities in the federal government? Yes. I would tell you, the federal government is ripe with opportunities. There's opportunities by way of the NDAA. There's opportunities that our go-to-market teams have created. Also the Pelco acquisition, if you recall from a year ago, had federal contracts in place. So there's opportunities there. So the federal government as part of the overall government market is one of the 3 largest growth vectors for us in fixed video. The second part of your question, I believe -- Eric, could you just repeat what was the second part? On enterprise. Enterprise. Yes. So just a reminder, our video security and access control business is still really roughly 70% to 3/4 enterprise. So Openpath, as Mahesh very eloquently alluded to, will -- I think, will accelerate converging opportunities between video security and access control. Our customers more and more -- COVID taught us that they want the ability to remote monitor networks. They want frictionless access control. I think the marriage of those 2 things together will only open up more and more doors in the price for us. And Eric, a quarter ago, Jack talked about fixed video government revenues being about $300 million, maybe a little bit more. I think as we sit here today, the government contribution for all-in video revenue is closer now to $330 million to $340 million of revenue. And again, the demand we see is really strong. We had 66% growth in Q2, about 40% of that was organic. And again, informing our full year raise, we now expect video security technology to be -- we said it was 20% plus, we now expect approximately 30%, with organic growth being a little bit more than 20% of that. So really good performance by that whole portfolio. Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. I guess I wanted to ask about the supply chain constraints. It's obviously a recurring theme through earning season here. But could you talk about what kind of revenue impact it might have had this quarter? And then also the margin impact? And then how do you see that going forward? Thanks for the question. So the supply environment that we've been navigating all year is primarily around LMR. And as Greg mentioned, specifically most around PCR. Our supply situation did improve incrementally in Q2. And in our guidance for the second half, we've contemplated continuing to have to navigate supply chain-related constraints. Those are factored into our full year guidance in our second half. So we expect to have -- to navigate through them. We're working with key suppliers, a handful of suppliers, handful of critically important parts. We're making progress. The teams are doing well. We have executive relationships that are helping us prioritize. And our suppliers recognize that our equipment is critically important to first responders. So we have good success in getting prioritization.
On the cost side, despite the challenging environment, we have not seen material input costs rise significantly in the first half. Of course, we plan every year for material cost reductions. Those are becoming more challenging to achieve. That said, we didn't see a big material cost driver in the first half. We'll navigate through some small increases in the second half. One area in the P&L that we are absorbing higher costs is freight. If you control for the volume and the growth that we've had, we're seeing rate increases where by the first half absorbed $20 million more than would have been expected on higher growth, which is a reflection of higher air freight, the shift to shorter supply chains, elongated lead times, et cetera, which we're navigating. So that's where we've seen the one input cost rise is in freight. Yes. And just to put a bow on it, George, I think that what's informing our full year raise for the year is demand not necessarily any improvement in supply chain. Although as Jason just talked about, I think he and his team did a very nice job in hand-to-hand combat working through Q2, but we have our work to do with key suppliers for the back half of the year. Again, this is primarily around PCR, but I think that view is contemplated into our full year guidance. Got it. And then, Greg, real quickly, you mentioned the raise on expectations for the full year. I think you're getting a tailwind from FX here. Certainly, you had some in Q2. I'm not sure how much of that was already in the plan. But it feels like you're going to continue to get some benefit. Is that part of the full year raise on guidance or no? Not much. The FX benefit when you take a look at the full year was much more weighted to the first half. So that's not really driving. It's a component, but it's not as much as it was in the first half. We had, I think, $100 million in the first half tailwind. And if I look back half Q3, Q4, that tailwind is more like approximately $40 million. So it hasn't changed much from the last time we shared those numbers, and it's always been first half tailwind more so than second half. Exactly. Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Greg and Jason, I think you all had previously characterized demand is increasing month by month not just quarter-by-quarter, but ongoing improvement. Is that moderating as we proceed further and further into the -- or out of the pandemic or perhaps not out of the pandemic? What are you seeing from a linearity perspective? Well, I mean, obviously, in terms of overall demand, demand is strong, Paul. It represents itself in Q2's results. I recognize the comp of it being a COVID quarter. But also guiding in Q3, a double-digit top line revenue print, 9.5% to 10% is strong. And that's being driven in large part by record backlog. So this is -- it's a really good demand environment. It's incrementally better. And look, if I take a step back, high level, I see demand strong I see the funding environment for our customers, and this is a North America-centric comment, but that's where 2/3 of our revenue is. And with the stimulus and $350 billion available to state and local, and then other monies available to education and FEMA and other areas, there's literally hundreds of billions available to our end user customers through the end of 2024, some of the outlined time lines.
So demand is strong. Funding is strong. Backlog is at a record Q2, and we're also getting traction with new products that we invested in during the downturn. And I think a lot of video security technology and that's double-digit growth rate in Q2 and the overall raise to now approximately 30% for video security technology, of which over 20 is organic, is driven by new product investment. We also talked about new product, APX NEXT. We're continuing new product on command center software, both prem and cloud, new product investment inorganically with cloud-based access controls. So high-level, Paul, again, there's a lot of work to do. And we want to be easy in the saddle in the second half and navigate these supply chain challenges, but there's a lot of positives that I see. Paul, even in the parts of our business that are less backlog driven, for example, video, that's about pipeline, it's about execution within the quarter and the 40% organic growth in Q2 and our outlook for now 30% growth for that business on the year is a function of higher pipeline as well as executing and delivering within the quarter on that part of the business. Paul, the other thing we've seen is that we saw a lot of our competitors furlough selling resources during COVID. We actually continue to put the pedal to the metal hired more, particularly in the video security space. And as we look back on that 12, 9 months after the fact, we think without a doubt, that's created a great opportunity and it's created our ability to go take market share in that space. Guys, can I just follow up? The massive amount of federal largesse that's on the docket, albeit not yet passed and may not pass, are customer or first responder agencies already talking to you about allocating funds or are they waiting for the actual dollars to flood? So Paul, what I would say is -- so think of this -- think of government money in 2 buckets. There's -- we don't even talk about the CARES Act money anymore. But by the way, CARES Act money was available last year that we benefited from, and it's available through the end of this year that we're benefiting from. I would say that the results we've printed so far largely don't even include the stimulus money that I just articulated, which is $350 billion of state and local, $170 billion in education, $38 billion in airport in transit, et cetera. But those conversations, to your question, Paul, are absolutely beginning to take hold with our go-to-market sales organization for both this year and multiyear planning. Next question will come from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Greg, can you talk about the prevalence of the access control market for the education vertical specifically? It seems that you've invested a lot for the education vertical with Avigilon and that security with access control has increased in importance with the multitude of gun-related incidents. Is this a major opportunity for Motorola? And do you plan to continue to be acquisitive in order to grow your share of the access control market? Louie, it's Jack. I'll start, and I think Mahesh will have some things to add in to my comments. So first of all, education is one of our top -- it's our second largest vertical in terms of growth right now in video security and access control. Front and center to what every school superintendents, school safety directors thinking about is safety of their kids. We talk about the convergence of video security and access control, but there's also the ability to converge 2-way radio through our Safety Reimagined platform that we're selling to schools. Greg just talked about the federal monies that have been pointed to schools. It's historic in terms of schools. One of the biggest problems they always had, there's interest, but there isn't funding. And now we've got interest married with funding. We also put together a specialized sales team that just talks to school superintendents every day, and we think that overlay team has helped us kind of accelerate opportunities. Mahesh, from a technology standpoint, is there anything you want to add? I think the only other thing I'd add there is we just launched our Motorola Solutions Concealed Weapons Detection Solution, which is a key part of the story. When you think about it in the context of access control, it's not just who are you, are you authorized to be there, but also what risk you pose. So this complements our access control solution really well. Our next question will come from Trevor Bowers with Northcoast Research. You mentioned on the last call and also earlier today that it looks like you're taking share in the body-worn camera market. What would you say is driving the success in that space? So I think, first of all, customers want an alternative. It's been a market primarily led by one company. They want an alternative. But I think in public safety, trusted relationships matter. We've been in business for, as you know, over 90 years. We've got trusted relationships throughout the state and local market. We also bear the advantage of having a very large international footprint. And we think that's obviously been beneficial to us as well. We've got things we're working on in terms of new products, both in terms of body-worn cameras in terms of in-car solutions. But again, we think it's an area around police transparency and accountability that will continue to get focus and funding. And we think there's an opportunity for 2 players in the market, and we're capitalizing accordingly. Maybe the one other thing I would add that I would add is Jack mentioned this previously, we meet our customers' needs where they are. And so having both an on-premises solution along with a cloud solution really matters here as well. And that's the other reason we win. Okay. Great. And then what sort of long-term impact would you say the pandemic has had on Motorola's go-to-market approach? For example, do you expect there to be less travel and entertainment spending in the future or maybe more efficiencies as a result of new sales and delivery methods? How should we think about that going forward? Great question. We've pivoted to digital. I think digital marketing and our spend to try to get customers, particularly customers that have latent needs that we may be unaware of, that's one. We've pivoted to continue to grow our inside sales force, not only in the U.S. but abroad. We think that's critically important. And we've also just become more efficient in terms of not only our frontline selling teams, but are all powerful sales engineers. How do you get more leverage and get more tactical acumen in the moments that matter with our customers? And that's truly been something that we've pivoted to.
With all that said, what we do are fairly large-scale enterprise or government sales, and it's going to take some face-to-face engagement. So we're still going out and seeing customers. But we've just driven to be more efficient, and we don't think it is much about time traveling and selling time. That was a legacy way to think about it. We think about and I measure our teams in terms of engagement and time now. And so that's really where we've seen the pivot. Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Greg, you've talked about the framing for the American Rescue Plan Act and the amount of money there. What's your perspective on when you see the sweet spot of that spending, if you think about your sales cycles and how it typically flows? And do you have any thoughts on how it might be influencing customer behavior in the different segments, radio, surveillance, command center? So Ben, first of all, thanks for the question. I think the sweet spot starts, and I mean just very early innings, in the back half of this year, and it's a multiyear run. So state and local funding, the $350 billion runs through December of '24, the $38 billion or $40 billion for airports and transit run through '24. There's $7 billion plus for broadband connectivity that runs through September of '30. It's a long runway. So I don't necessarily think there's going to be a pop the clutch quarter for a multi-month period. I think it's going to be strong and reasonable reasonably consistent over the next few years.
I think it helps -- I actually think it helps across the suite of what we provide. It helps LMR, public safety LMR, primarily P25 and the sustainability of multiyear service contracts that elongate these platforms that allow us to do subscriber and radio refresh like APX NEXT over a multiyear period. I think it clearly helps video, whether it's fixed video or body-worn for state and local county municipalities. We talked about the benefits around education. And quite frankly, I think money can flow around 911 PSAP and command center software as well. So I think it's a lift for all 3. Hard to dimensionalize which one is more of a benefit, but it's clearly favorably to the products and solutions that we have and like to position. And then a follow-up, Jason, if I could. You gave the disaggregation of the revenue on Slide 13. Could you talk a little bit about the way to think about how much of this is being recurring. And also interested if there's any variation in either average contract duration or how customers are invoicing the recurring business versus the traditional product type businesses? Sure. Thanks, Ben. So in terms of recurring, our proxy for recurring is the segment that is software and services, which I believe this quarter was 38% of total revenues. That includes a lot of different varieties of recurring business, including service renewals, subscriptions, et cetera, and that was up significantly and has been growing, as you know, even during the pandemic and is growing at a rate that's very positive. With earnings expansion at OE this year, we believe now at 170 bps of OE expansion within the services -- software and services segment. So not only growing but expanding profitability.
On the technology side, from that same disaggregation, you can see that the video is a strong driver as well as command center software and that LMR is performing well -- as well with up mid-single digits. Our next question will come from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. So given the very favorable backdrop that you just highlighted. I if I understood you correctly, Greg, that some of the funding from 2020 is beginning to flow through right now for some programs like the AFG program, getting funding from bills that were passed in calendar 2020. So yet to see the benefit of all the ARA and the stimulus spending. Why not take the opportunity to update us on the long-term model? It clearly looks like your 9 10 model is a little bit conservative. You probably can make it 8 10 now, given the expansion in operating margins from favorable software sales. Fahad, thank you. So look, this is a strong environment. Demand is strong and the environment is generally favorable, but we are still in a pandemic. And we see that, by the way, popping up, not just with the Delta variant and different policies within the U.S., but we've seen it in supply chain. We've seen it in factories. We've seen it in other countries, and we want to be prudent and mindful around the current environment that we're in. And while demand is strong and funding is good, and there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic and encouraged, we just want to be very mindful and aware of what we don't know and the uncertainty that I think is informing and incorporated into the remainder of the full year.
I do think that there'll be time, Fahad, over time to update all of you in 2022. By the way, I think that we're likely going to have an Analyst Day. We're targeting doing that in Q1 of next year, as we get through this fiscal year, as we get through the large implications of the pandemic, as we get to a point where hopefully the FDA gives general approval for the vaccine, as we get to where many more populations in countries are vaccinated and herd immunity is achieved. And we do think that's a better environment to give an update at that point in time.
So I'm not going to -- I appreciate your interest and not going to update the model per se yet, but I like we're positioned for the back half of the year, and I think we've got some good momentum to build on. All right. I appreciate the answer. I have a follow-up question on video. Thank you for disclosing that fixed government video is about $300 million. Can you give us a sense on how big mobile is and how fast could that be growing in general? It seems like it's growing even faster than your fixed video access control business? Yes, just 2 things. Video, first of all, Fahad, on the $300 million, we're now updating that today where we expect the video revenue to government customers now to be about $30 million to $340 million. We talk about the addressable market of video security and access control of being about $15 billion. By the way, that's a 2021 addressable market number. That grows next year. That's inclusive of fixed video. It's inclusive of body-worn video. It's inclusive of in-car video and the commensurate VMS software and cloud-based revenues. So it's an all-in number. Remember, with the acquisition of Avigilon, which is fixed video, the acquisition of Pelco, fixed video, the acquisition of IndigoVision fixed video, that fixed video is the predominant amount of revenue contribution within the technology disaggregation that we characterize, just to give you a reminder. Yes. So at the total level of all video the rough split between what is fixed video and what is mobile video at the $1 billion plus. The part of our business that this year is growing, we believe, at 30% this year, and that's our increased expectations is 70% fixed and 30% mobile. Both are growing nicely. Okay. Can you care share with us how fast is mobile going? Is it like -- in the quarter, how fast was it? Is it high 50%? Yes, I would just say this in terms of data points. Remember, Q2 was, I know 66% all-in, 40%, a little bit more, was organic. And Jack talked about strong double-digit, 60%, 65% orders growth for body worn. So that's strong growth, which has driven us taking share in the first half. And given that the market is looking for a viable alternative and our product performance continues to improve. And when I look at the body-worn video book of business, and things like Malta or the U.K. or the French MOI, it's pretty strong growth. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Great job really executing through such a turmoil time of COVID, supply chain issues and things like that. Looking ahead, is it possible that as hopefully we get mass immunity and COVID hopefully dies down and people return back to the office and meetings in person. Is it possible that your command center business and installations could actually accelerate, just because it's been so hard to meet with people and do testing and show all the bells and whistles of your solutions? And also with the government stimulus is coming in? Or is that just not the way to think about how things could roll out in the, say, the next year or 2? Jim, I would think about it that as we printed the first half of the year in Q2 and look at the second half and basically, what you're describing is the trends. I really see video security and access control leading the way, which is why we're raising the technology view from what we thought would be a full year 20% plus performance to approximately 30% and that's driving the segment guide products in SI from mid to mid to high.
So I think if you're thinking about an anchor tenant of incremental growth from current expectations of where we were, I think it's led by video security and then the second area I'd actually say is LMR. And those 2 areas are driving the increased momentum. With command center software, while it's our smallest component, we're still growing at greater the industry rate. So I'm pleased about that. But we also are offering both on-prem and cloud, and we've got organic work to do on the internal development on cloud. But I think, Jim, looking forward, I think of video security, access control and LMR as being more of an incremental drivers from a trend standpoint. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO, for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, everybody. Listen, I'm really pleased with Q2's results and the execution we were able to achieve. And I just want to take the opportunity to thank my team and to thank all the people in Motorola Solutions. You delivered, you produced, you were on flinching, you're resilient, and I'm super proud of you. I think the other thing I'm proud of is we've continued to invest in this business. We did it in the throes of COVID last year. Jack referenced it. We continue to do that. I think in part some of the benefits we're able to demonstrate and the second raise of the year is driven by ongoing investment decisions we've made.
And last 2 thoughts are I like our momentum. I like the momentum as we enter this back half of the year, particularly pleased with the increased strength of video security. But I'm also proud of the fact that now approximately half of our revenue for the full year will be derived from video security and software and services. And that's a much different composition and disposition than where we were several years ago. So I just want to thank everybody. To my team, I'm proud of you, and we got a lot of work to do, and we know what we need to do in the back half. So thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] You will have the opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Products, Sales & Services; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Senior Vice President and CTO, Software Enterprise & Mobile Video. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter. In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment.
In video security and access control revenue was up 26% driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings. And in command center software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing install base and win new customers. And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS.
I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Greg. Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3% of sales up from 24.8% driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments. OpEx in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion up $225 million compared with last year and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year. The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year. Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of CapEx.
Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million. We invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers are concealed weapons detection solution, and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash.
Moving next to our segment results, Q3 products and system integration sales were $1.3 billion up 14% driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million. Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro São Paulo in Brazil. And also during the quarter, we grew our video security and access control product revenue by 23%.
Moving to the software and services segment, Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million. Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved OpEx leverage.
Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multi-year extension with a customer in North America, a $17 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million CommandCentral suite and video security order with the City of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%. Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence.
Moving next to our regional results. Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10% also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year driven primarily by growth in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million also driven primarily by growth in North America. Software and services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year driven by a $479 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on AirWave and ESN over the last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million driven primarily by revenue recognition for AirWave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America. The products in SI backlog would up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.
Turning next to our outlook. We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to our prior guide of 9.5% to 10%. And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share. This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%. It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5% along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. And finally, we now expect full year OpEx to be $1.95 billion inclusive of our two latest acquisitions Openpath and Envysion. And we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate.
With that I'd like to now turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions. But first, our results for the quarter were outstanding and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment. We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog.
Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the two segments. In products in SI demand for both our LMR and video security solutions remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business, and in particularly our PCR business, as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3 and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4. In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improve profitability.
In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment. Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services and in software, while we now expect command center software revenue growth to be low double digits. Our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio.
Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned. Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility. We're expanding our relationships within our existing install base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as I've seen it, and our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions, and while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue earnings and cash flow growth in 2022.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please your mind our callers on the line how to ask a question? Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Thank you. Maybe just one on the video and access control, obviously, 30% plus really strong this year, can you talk a little bit about sustainability as we look into next year? And what do you think some of the real guideposts we should be watching as far as drivers, NDAA, FCC, any other things that could lead to market share gains there? And then the follow-up on the command center software side, low double digits. I think, there have been some views, it could be better than that. So maybe can you talk a little bit about, what needs to be done for that business to reaccelerate from these levels? Is it winning new customers? Is it more stimulus? Is it more the bundle sales? If you could give us some color on that too. That'd be great. Thank you. Yes, Tim, on video, it's just -- it's phenomenal execution by Molloy and the entire management team. As you know, it's our largest addressable market now expected to grow over 30%, by the way, organically, it's probably a little over 20%, so still really a strong, robust growth. We've rounded out the portfolio. We've refreshed the product portfolio. I think Jack and team had done a great job investing in go-to-market and increasing our R&D in a downturn market. I think video continues to be more -- and access control continues to be more and more important with our customers and more of a need to have than a nice to have.
As you referenced, the NDAA is helpful for sure around federal procurement, as well as the eligibility for federal grant money. And look with the FCC, as you know, and as you referenced, there's pending legislation has been done. It's awaiting Biden's signature. If President Biden signs it when and if he does that authorizes the FCC to proceed with the rulemaking they've undertaken which would evaluate Chinese vendors in the entire enterprise market. So that clearly would be significant as well. Don't know the timing for that. But that would be a tailwind if that were to materialize.
I don't know if Jack, you want to add anything about the overall demand profile. Just the only other thing, I think, first of all, new product introduction, both in terms of cameras, but also moving pivoting the capability for the move to the cloud. I think also you look at it from an acquisition standpoint. We've acquired Openpath, who's really quite frankly, a game changer from the access control standpoint. This week, Tim, we announced the acquisition of Envysion. So you can look at that as a way for us to get more vertically focused in terms of our solution. And as Greg talked about in the past, one of the reasons we acquired Pelco and IndigoVision was to add greater international scale. We've invested heavily in go-to-market North America. I think the next frontier will be in Europe, Middle East, and Africa. And as it relates to command center software, candidly, Tim, in retrospect that the target was maybe a little overly ambitious, but having said that we're still growing at 1.5x the market, so we're taking share it's growing double digits. Q3 was particularly good on orders and the backlog composition is a little bit longer in duration incorporating some things around next-gen 911 and annual recurring revenue. And just in terms of specific things that we're doing a core tenet for us is always to meet customers where they are. That's a part of our product strategy. Many of our customers have invested in some sophisticated IT infrastructure on-premises, and they would like to continue to benefit from those investments, but they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud, and we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own timeline. And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing three specific things there.
One, we're offering our on-prem solutions, inclusive of CAD and Records on a subscription basis. We're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in command central cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, cybersecurity is a very important consideration, regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud or integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both the solutions as a whole. I think all of that combined really accelerates the adoption of cloud capabilities across all our customers. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. First around this time of every single year, you should give us out year initial takes or views. Greg, I was hoping you'd give us any kind of guideposts for revenue or EPS growth or even margin. And then the second question, I have is actually on just U.S. federal on what percentage of revenue that was in the quarter? And what the expectation is for U.S. federal revenues to be for the full year. That's it. Thank you. Yes. So we're not going to obviously Sami guide 2022 per se, but I will tell you that kind of, as we sit here today we're thinking, tough supply chain environment, by the way, Q3 was a tough, I'm proud of the quarter. I'm proud of the print, but it was tough and Q4 is tough as well. So I think that Q3, Q4 from a supply chain standpoint is the toughest we've experienced. We still expect it to be difficult and challenging first half of '22 at least -- first half of '22, so that's kind of the backdrop having said that. I think about revenue growth at this point high level of about 7% and maybe further dimensionalization of software and services, revenue growth of around 10% that's high level. Our current thinking obviously details to follow in a quarter from now, it would also be our expectation and goal to expand operating margins. But in '22 in the face of higher input costs as well, that's kind of some high level color. And Sami, to mention the second part of your question with respect to Fed, it's roughly 8% of our revenues. Well, we're having another strong year in Fed like last year. So 8% of revenues is, is its contribution to us. It's one in totality. It's one of our largest customers. Perfect. And actually I had one follow-up and maybe this is for Mahesh. It's about the M500 in-car video system enabled by AI. Do you guys have any competitors that actually do this right now, at least with an install-based like yours and even a rollout or even go-to-market product like yours? No. WatchGuard for the past 10 years has been the leader in in-car video of body-worn and the M500 is really a product of all the insights and the excellent feedback we've gotten from those customers. And candidly, I think the M500 improves upon the core features of the four RE, which is the current in-car video solution from WatchGuard. We improve on our synchronized playback capability, which is something that is that tight integration with our body-worn camera and our in-car video solution, so that you can get a perspective of what's happening in the incident in a time synchronized manner. This is something that is very unique to what we do. Record after the fact is a very unique capability that we have within the WatchGuard portfolio. And we have a dedicated display capability in the product, which is something that we've got an excellent feedback from our customers on.
It allows you to both record review and tag a video with a dedicated display. In addition to that, what M500 brings to the table is ALPR capabilities. ALPR capabilities, not just with watch lists, but also integrated with our learn platform, which has the largest database of play treats out there. That's time and location stamped, which allows for great real-time forensics and investigation capability. And to the rear camera in the M500 platform, we have added passenger analytics capabilities so that when a passenger is detected, we can actually effectively trigger recordings as an option, configurable within the system. The platform itself is AI-enabled to the point where now we can add new capabilities in the future via simple firmware upgrade. So it's actually future-proof for customers as well. So all in, this is a very unique and a powerful in-car video platform, that's a product of all the experience that we've gained over the past 10 years. And Greg, perhaps if I could elaborate on this about 7% growth. Yes, Sure. As we look at next year and plan for it, the linearity we're looking at for Q1 is more consistent with 2019, about 21%. In fact, the 2019 first half, or the entirety of the linearity of that year looks to be a better indicator for what we see in terms of supply chain and the planning we're doing for the business. Got it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi guys. Thanks very much for the question. I'm on here for George Notter. This was a really strong result for a product backlog coming out of the quarter. It looks like you've had a good quarter for the number of larger LMR deals and that seems to be driving. And you had a good portion from U.S. and international. So I'm wondering if you can comment on what's driving the volume of larger deals, like, is there something specific or a trend that's kind of going on in the near term? Or is this general continued macro recovery after the pandemic eases worldwide? And I'm also wondering if you could expect that momentum to continue based on your view of the pipeline. Thanks. Yes, Kyle. So to your point it's been a very good first three quarters of the year. We actually expect that performance to continue. We're sitting on record backlog of $631 million year-over-year, and that's not only historically. We'd look at that and say, that's North America phenomenon. I think the strength of the story here, it's North America performance. So it's large scale device refresh. It's statewide infrastructure upgrades. Some of which were in further discussions through ARP funding, which will play out over the course of the next few years, but also internationally, we've been in receipt of two large orders from the German defense as well as a Romanian upgrade as well. So again, we've been really pleased the performance to date. We expect that performance to continue. Yes, demand is definitely exceeding supply. And the other thing about our backlog, particularly in products is approximately half of it's expected to turn into revenue within 12 months. So there's a longer duration impact of some of the deals Jack mentioned where we're deploying, implementing, and they benefit the revenue stream over a longer period. Yes. And Kyle, just the last thing I'd say is, as I said, in my prepared remarks, demand is strong and our demand visibility is good. In addition to the backlog that Jack articulated and the linearity that Jason just said, taking a step back, this is more than just pent-up demand. It's a reflection of what we do is a need to have versus a nice to have the funding environment, as I referenced both budgets and stimulus is strong. We've refreshed a lot of the portfolio on the product side. We've made a conscious investment in go-to-market channels and feet on The Street we've continued to acquire. We've got the benefit of the National Defense Authorization Act. More revenue is software and services oriented. So I think there's a lot of different positive ingredients in the blender here that continue to fuel our growth going forward. Okay, great. Thanks very much. And one follow-up, do you – I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but do you have an update on the run rate of the PCR business now and maybe an outlook for the continued recovery and the outlook for PCR? Yes, I think PCR is where the supply chain challenges most acute. It grew in Q3. It will grow for the full year, Kyle probably as we match supply and demand and it's fluid, it will, we expect it to end up about mid to high-single-digit growth with a reasonable chunk of delinquent backlog for us to execute against in 2022. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start on the product and system integration margin expansion. Operating profit grew at double the rate of revenue basically, and had nice margin expansion in that segment. I wouldn't consider this an industry where you'd get short-term pricing power benefit to hit margins positively, so just maybe looking for some more color on the PSI margin expansion? And then as an extension to that question, I look at that segment, before COVID, it was a low to mid-20s operating margin, clearly not going to finish there in 2021 based on your guidance, but maybe some of the gating factors to getting back to those historical operating margins in that segment would be helpful. Sure. So thanks for the question. So one thing that's we're pleased with the operating margin expansion in products. One thing that we are benefiting from is the prioritization of our portfolio to public safety. So that's a favorable mix element around margins and ASP's. As Greg mentioned and Jack we're constrained more so in PCR, which is a bit on the lower tier. So favorable mix is definitely improving what you see in Q3, we're pleased with the OE performance on the year.
I would also remind you that as we began the year and plan this year at the OE line for the company, we were facing $100 million dollar year-over-year increase in incentives, as we reset the plans to 100% coming off of last year where we only paid half. So the bulk of that $100 million for the year is in the product segment. So we're expanding, operating margins despite overcoming that additional P&L burden. In terms of its outlook, we're continuing to manage through higher input costs, higher freight, but our plans with the growth that we've talked about, we will continue even in the face of higher supply costs to expand operating margins in that segment. Got it. And maybe as a follow-up Greg, I'm going to take a stab since it's been in the public domain on Airwave, any potential comments you could make on developments, investors have long considered you kind of double hedged because of both Airwave and ESN, but wondering if they should be considering the potential risk of losing that hedge? And secondly, you're not afraid to get creative. I'm just wondering if there's maybe any sort of alternative ownership structures, like a JV or something like that, that you're considering. So I know it's a tough topic, but anything that you can give us would be helpful. Thank you. I appreciate the question. So just to remind you, I think, Adam, that the contract for Airwave runs through all of next year through 2022. ESN under its current construct runs through all of 2024. We've been in active conversations with the UK home office. They have expressed the desire to extend the Airwave contract. That's underpinned the ongoing conversations we've had. We also obviously are involved with the CMA and are adhering to the process that they've outlined. I think the process will take several months. It will go into well into 2022.
There's really nothing more to say on it, on that front, other than we continue to make the investments in the network as well, to keep it current, to keep it reliable, the service levels to the end user customer, and no disruption to that are the absolute utmost importance. And we'll continue the dialogue with both the UK home office and the CMA, and, I am hopeful that we'll have constructive outcomes, but we'll see how it plays out over the next several months. But I do appreciate you bringing it up. Understood. Very helpful. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Adam. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Trevor filling in for Keith. Have a couple of questions about this supply chain. So how have the supply chain challenges evolved since the last quarter? Do you expect them to worsen before improving or would -- from your perspective, would you say the supply chain challenges are peaked? It's a great question, Trevor. I think the most acute challenges we've had year-to-date were undoubtedly in Q3. I think they're continuing in Q4. So if I look at 2021, definitely the most pain on supply chain we've experienced is in Q3. And we expect to experience in Q4. I think the environment will be rugged and challenging through the first half, at least the first half of 2022. And that's informing obviously the guide for the remainder of the year, although we're raising top and bottom, and it informs the linearity that Jason referred to earlier around Q1. And I'd also add in terms of what we're doing to manage through a difficult environment. Number one, we're prioritizing our customer needs, and that starts with public safety. Additionally, Motorola has world-class engineering across the organization. Jack's team is helping think through alternative designs where engineers very quickly find parts that are available when one part is constrained. So our teams are doing a good job there. Each one of us here on the call have supplier relationships that we have C level dialogues going on so that we can get our allocations. And finally, we're carrying higher inventory as well to manage the environment. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thanks Trevor. Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead. Greg, Jason, Mahesh, Jack, and Tim, good evening. Excellent. LMR product revenue increased by a healthy 12% this quarter after an 18% increase last quarter, despite the referenced supply chain issues, can you give us a sense on what you think your penetration is for your APX NEXT radio, your MXP600 Tetra. And you were recently announced MOTOTRBO. I think you launched the APX next in the fall of 2019. So a lot of investors are just wondering, like, what inning are we in for the respective upgrade cycles for these different product refreshes that you have had over the past couple of years? So Louie, first let's attack the APX NEXT piece. It's very early days. We're really, really pleased. So we announced it in '19, obviously last year during the COVID year, I would say, we had -- the market was somewhat stalled in the first and second quarter. We've seen a significant ramp up in terms of orders since then. But all day long we've talked about, you've heard me make mentioned before. This is typically a three to five-year cycle where we start getting some material, a refresh within our customers base U.S. about an inning. I'd say we're in the top of the second inning potentially. We have room to run here in terms of APX NEXT.
The second question was related to the MXP600 in Europe and it's again, very early days. We've had some market success. But the interesting thing to point out for both the APX NEXT, as well as the MXP is those were designed for very high tier part of the market. So that's attractive, but the reality is we're going to be feathering in mid-tier and entry tier on both the APX NEXT line, as well as the MXP line. So we're really encouraged by that because that starts to get to the need of the market, so to speak. So I think that answers your question. Great. And you spoke about the supply chain headwind persisting through the first half of 2022. Do you think these issues results in a deceleration in the recent revenue rate or should we forecast for like sustained revenue growth for the next three quarters? No, Louie, I think our comments or my comments around the linearity that we're planning for reflect our views of the supply chain, particularly for Q1 in the first half of next year, limiting our ability to fulfill the very good demand that's there and yes, for things to improve in the second half and to have a good year that Greg mentioned of planning for about 7% in total revenue growth. Great. Thanks. Thanks, Louie. Next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Thanks guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. First off, if I miss it, I apologize. But what was the supply chain impact in Q3 and what do you expect it to be in Q4 in terms of quantifying it, both the revenue impact and the margin impact? So in terms of Q3 our results and the growth that we had except for PCR which was limited in its ability we were able to match the supply with the demand pretty well in Q3, as we look to Q4 and the constraints that we have in embedded in our guidance for the year and therefore Q4 about $100 million of revenue is limited. That could have been there we had the requisite supply, that's our current estimate. In terms of an impact to Q4 that said, we're still growing greater than we thought and guided to last time now, 10 to 10.25. But that $100 million is our current estimate as to have we had a better supply, what more we could have done in Q4? Jason, am I doing the math, right? That's about if I translate that to an EPS, it's about an -- it's about $0.10 impact. Depends on the mix, obviously. It depends on the mix and a large part of that's PCR. So it's probably a little left of center. But in general, you can do the math as you've done around, what does contribution could be at? I'd add further color around the supply chain costs that we are seeing in order to get the requisite supply. There are increasing costs. I mentioned freight before many companies like us are facing higher freight costs, the number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year was a lot of that in the second half.
And then as I looked at Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4 having to buy and get these materials, not only through expedited freight, but also through other means through brokers and distribution and the like is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for Q4. So those things are in the mix too. We're doing what's necessary to get the supply that we can get. Jason, I apologize. You're expecting $20 million pressure in Q4 from freight costs or from elevated component costs? The components' is the $20 million number in Q4. Freight is an annual number. Paul that we've been bearing all along and on its annual basis, it's $45 million, about $20 million in the first half and $25 million in the second half, that's the freight higher costs. The ocean and air both are exorbitant prices right now. And we're having to mix two more faster delivery methods, which is causing a higher freight cost as well. All right. But it sounds like it's a 1% to 1.5%, if I assume a $10 million to $15 million impact in Q4 from freight, it's about $30 million, $35 million all in, it looks like it's about 1.5 percentage point adverse impact, if I did the math, right? Those are the numbers that we've shared are our estimates within what we were facing. So I think you've got correctly captured, yes. Yes. I think you're in the zip code. All right. I appreciate it. It sounds pretty meaningful between revenue margins, not surprisingly? My other questions is also clarifications, you always said that if I remember correctly, I think you said public sector video in Q2 had hit a $330 plus million run rate, annual run rate of from $300 million previously. I'm hoping you could update us. And I think similarly you'd said mobile cameras, body-worn cameras in 2Q was up 80% year-over-year, that was an acceleration over 60% previously. I was hoping you could update that growth, right? Yeah. I think, and Jack can jump in. I think the $330 million you referenced was an estimate for 2021 for public sector contribution. And I think we're holding to that number. So I don't think we have an update on that front and on body-worn, Jack if you want to. Paul, with body-worn so record unit shipments in Q3, really pleased with that. We've talked about as active customers, our customers want that alternative. We think we filled that really well. The other thing I'd say is, we're uniquely positioned internationally, given our scale and global presence. We talked about the French NOI they've actually put subsequent orders into Q3. Mahesh just referenced M500. So we think we're in a good position right now in body-worn car. All right. Just one -- last quick one for me. In terms of pricing environment in supply constraints, I'd be surprised, if it got worse and it won't be a surprise, it got better, but any insight you can set and what you're seeing competitively? Yes. We've been looking carefully at our portfolio throughout the year. We've made a few surgical adjustments in LMR primarily in North America and also in fixed video. We'll continue to look at that. Another opportunity for us is we have constant new product releases and oftentimes as Jack mentioned, APX NEXT, for example. We typically release at the higher part of the portfolio. And with that presents a mix opportunity to offset some of the costs that we discussed earlier. So we'll continue to look at it carefully, and of course, monitoring, what is a very competitive in market that we're in both LMR and fixed video. Great. I appreciate the responses. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. Next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, Greg or Jack, I was hoping you could take us through a little bit about what you're seeing with America rescue plan funding to date, how you think it might've manifested thus far. And then the second part of the question is, I'd be interested in any thoughts you have about how customers are looking at this money within each piece of your business. So within surveillance radio and even command center, how you think it's influencing their behavior. That's it for me. Thank you. Okay. So first of all, Greg said it earlier and I think it's always important to point out, but we're in a unique position because really what we do is all need to have, it's not nice to have. So I'd kind of decompose the American rescue plan conversation to a few different things. We have public safety and that's everything from P25 statewide and local networks to command center software. We're in pretty consistent dialogue with our customers regularly in public safety who had what we call shovel ready projects or things that maybe would have been a mid-tier kind of midterm need. And we're in conversations on how they may fund those things. Now, the other benefit is state and local receipts actually particular at the state level revenues are up as well. So Greg made a comment earlier about funding environment, the funding environment, I would say, doing business in public safety in 28 years, it's the best I've ever seen as well.
So I would say, we're in a really good position there both on the P25 landscape, infrastructure upgrades and devices, as well as command center software. Our teams, the one thing our sales team does, we think they're really good at technology. We think they're better and they're experts at getting deals funded. So we think that's going to benefit us there. The second thing, I would say the other technology sleeve, that's going to benefit significantly as video security and access control. If you think about education alone, school funding, $170 billion pointed to that market, and really when kids have come back to school, the first thing they're talking about is they're talking about, how do we bring them back in a safe manner? One of the things our team did over the COVID we talked about this was to write COVID dashboard. So if you connect to a Avigilon cloud services, you get our COVID dashboard gives social distancing who went through what door. This is all really pertinent information. And we think our school superintendent, security directors are really interested in our technology here.
The last thing, I would say is, there's money being pointed at airports and transit $35 billion as they reopen, many of them are upgrading both the radio networks. So we've got opportunities for PCR with all the major airlines, as well as our consoles in the command center space. And then ultimately also video security, how do they protect the perimeter security? How do they get better information? So I would say across all three of our technology continuums, as well as our services business, the money, the environment we're in a good spot. We think our sales team is poised to execute. And Ben when you total up those buckets within the rescue plan that Jack just described, it's over a $0.5 trillion that is available to our end users, $350 billion in state and local, by the way, that's multi-year and goes through the end of '24. So hence why we both see and believe that the environment multi-year and what we're seeing in the pipeline is pretty good. Thanks guys. Thank you, Ben. Our next question comes from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking my question. First, a clarification, can you remind me what revenue was from acquisitions in the quarter? Yes. In total, I'll give it to you by a segment real quick. It was -- in products, it was $12 million and in services and software, it was only $3 million. Appreciate it. Thank you. Now to my question, if I look at your LMR business overall, well, PSI sales, if we accelerated the software and services and tax rate coming and remains in the $550 million, $545 million quarterly run rate, should we see kind of like an increase in the software services from the increased product from the increased PSI sales in future quarters? Is it just because you're selling new equipment and the software services hasn't quite attached to it yet? So we should expect some meaningful acceleration in software and services revenue for LMR in fiscal '22? So Fahad, this year for products, for example, we're expecting mid to high, probably closer to high-single-digit growth services and software is low double digits. There is some leading indicator as products grow you're right. There's some services attached to it that come after the sale, the bulk, however, of our services and software growth is around not product attacks, task, but rather command center software, video software and things like software upgrade programs and the likes that are on existing install bases. So those are the key drivers within S&S. It's less product attached. It's more the unique offerings we have in the value propositions around services and software that are driving the low double digit growth in services and software. Got it. And then same question on the video surveillance there the software services portion of the video surveillance market is clearly growing a lot faster? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. What's driving the software attach rates or services in video versus PSI sales? I just kind of try to help us understand the dynamics there, please. So with respect to video in the disaggregation within services and software, the video number within services and software is largely software. It's a minimally services business because we go through distribution partners, integrators and the likes. So think of that video software number within S&S as being predominantly software, things like our video management system, BMS ACC and others are offers within in-car video. Our -- what's -- more in that case, it's real pure software and a terrific business, somewhat product detached, but also standalone in terms of how we sell it. It's the analytics, it's the AI at the edge. It's all the things we do. I made mention earlier that we've invested into our Avigilon cloud services. We've now got meaningful connections on that, and that'll be another way for customers to get upgrades. And I think make they keeping current on software, software maintenance more dynamic as well. Yes. And particularly that connections to the clouds and the work that Jack's doing with his team are leading to many new business opportunities hundreds of thousands of cameras, thousands of sites. And the business is really moving in that direction to cloud enabled. And the last thing Fahad, I'd say on that is, you hear Greg talk a lot about acquisitions. I'll hit again on Envysion. That's approximately $25 million in recurring revenue. There you think about Openpath which is an access control recurring revenue model access control. And so there were re-envisioning that business as well. So I just -- those are other things that really are more software driven, recurring revenue model business, and that's really where we're pushing the business. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi team. This is Erik on for Meta. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on another great quarter. You understand this is a small dealer relative to everything else, but maybe if we could dive in a little bit on the command center deal, you saw with the City of Yonkers, I'm wondering like what drove their upgrade to command central was that timing of refresh with what they already had. Were they looking to integrate their body-camera deployment? And then you also noted to fix the video portion of that. Are they integrating fixed a video into the command central deployment? And are there other similar deals in the pipeline that you're looking at that you can work with customers maybe as they take advantage of some of their funding? I'll take a first stab at this, but at the customer level, Yonkers is a very progressive technologically savvy police, chief and command staff. This started I want to say this probably started nine. The discussion started probably sometime mid last year originally around a mobile video. And they've added obviously to that in the command center space. And I think what they're thinking about is they're leveraging how is information sharing so everything from digital evidence management to how that's shared seamlessly through the rest of the command center. I don't know if Mahesh has anything else you'd add onto that but? Yes, I think you can think about this -- across the incident life cycle. We have products today that touch on every aspect of that incident lifecycle, a fixed video from Avigilon really gives you that pre-incident view, but also gives you that view during the incident integrated into or being management solution, but also coming into our command central aware platform as well. Then you have CommandCentral suite products across the board. Then you have vigilant ALPR solution. That was part of that equation as well, to enable fast investigations. Leveraging both the fixed camera solution, but also ALPR cameras as well, body-worn cameras feeding into that same evidence platform adding to the mix and then mass notification was also part of the story there. So all that together, it really gives you a view of an integration between those products really enabling effective incident response. And I think that was the value to Yonkers. Thank you. And I mean, when you just see the market and those types of deals, do you expect more of a consolidation that way? It seems that it would make sense, but also understand not everyone is tech. Is that tech savvy as maybe their police chief? What can you do from a sales motion perspective to kind of bring in more deals like that? So, two things Mahesh used this -- made a comment, and this is something that Mahesh and I talk about all the time. It's meet customers, where they are. So some customers have a different -- they're on different investment journey. Some may want to buy from different vendors, what we're incenting our sales team to do. And this is really important. And this actually started in 2020 is incenting them, and they have a chance to make some pretty significant incentives to sell full suite integrated networks, where they're using all pieces of our command center software technology. That's the goal. We think they've got the right relationships and what they'll need to do is go continue to execute on that and find more and more Yonkers. I'll just add to that. Just after that so 75% of our orders in Q3 were either new customers' ordering more than one of our platforms or adding to existing Motorola Solutions, really leveraging that tight integration between them all. It's a great start. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Thank you. Mine will be pretty easy. The first one is Greg, you said something in my ears, didn't quite catch it. So maybe you can clarify, you said really preliminary, preliminary, really early looks for next year. I heard a 7% then I think I heard a 10%, but I wasn't sure if you're breaking down product services or company-wide, if you could just clarify that, then I have one other little clarification. Sure. Jim. Yes, no. I was talking about 7% revenue growth in 2022 full company view and then software and services being around 10% revenue growth within that envelope. That's kind of what we see at this point in time. And then the details and more color we'd give a quarter from now. So that was easy. My second easy part is, and then I'll be done. Your outlook, you raised your revenues for the full year and for Q4, but then the EPS you raised it, but not as much as the EPS beat, is that all attributed to additional shipping costs? Or is there something else in Q4 as to why earnings wouldn't be as much as the beat that just we had in Q3? Thank you. Jim, it's Jason. It's some of what I discussed earlier with Paul around supply chain costs, but additionally, it is higher OpEx in Q4 for funding the two acquisitions that we just brought into the fold of Openpath exactly and Envysion, which is driving our envelope to 1950 for the year. Those are -- we're very happy to fund those within the OpEx line, great companies. That's also a factoring into the math that you're doing. Thank you. And thanks so much for the details on the calls. Thank you, Jim. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you. Listen, I just want to say thank you to the whole management team, but also to all the employees in MSI. I mean, there's so many good things going on, but it's a tough environment. I want to thank the people on the frontline, the sales organization, that's really executing well and contributing to Q3 record backlogs supply. You hear it with every company. You hear it all the time, but the supply chain environment, as we said, challenging in Q3, remains challenging in Q4. And I just think the team here in mixing and matching and there's more fluidity and uncertainty in supply chain in Q3 and Q4 than we've had in prior periods. And I think the adaptability staying in touch and close touch with key suppliers. I appreciate all that.
Everybody on the support teams and back office and support functions in particularly HR and Karen Dunning and Terry Bell, because we have, it's a tough environment. We have vaccine mandate compliance requirements. We're always following rules and regulations by facility and by state and Karen and Terry, Mark Hacker phenomenal. I'm thrilled with Q3 and the results across the board. I'm proud that we're able to for three consecutive quarters' raise top and bottom line. And I think we're really well positioned going into 2022, despite the challenges we have, but we'll stick together, like we always do. We'll be flexible and will continue to be steadfast and focused. And I appreciate everybody's contribution onward and upward. And thank you everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after the conclusion of the call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter and, in particular, our ability to navigate the current supply chain environment to deliver the critical solutions that our customers rely on every day. We achieved revenue at the higher end of our guidance and earnings per share above our guidance, ended the year with record backlog of $13.6 billion, up 19% versus last year, and generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and a record $1.8 billion for the full year.
Second, our full year results exemplify the strength and durability of our business and highlight our ability to leverage our large installed base to sell more value-add software and services. For the year, the Software and Services segment grew 13%, expanded operating margins by 210 basis points and accounted for 38% of total sales and 54% of total operating earnings for the company. Additionally, revenue was up double digits in all 3 technologies in the segment, led by 39% growth in video security and access control software, which resulted in approximately $400 million for that category of revenue for the year.
And finally, looking ahead to this year, our record backlog and continued demand are informing our expectations for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth, with growth in both segments despite the ongoing and fluid supply chain challenges.
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, including $10 million from acquisitions and $6 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $549 million and operating margins of 23.7% compared to 24.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $670 million, up $3 million. And non-GAAP operating margins of 28.9%, down 40 basis points due to higher operating expenses for employee incentive compensation and acquisitions.
Operating margin in Products and Systems Integration was down 170 basis points due to lower sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in the Software and Services segment. GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 compared to $2.37 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.85 versus $2.86 last year with higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services, offset by, within the Products and Systems Integration segment, higher OpEx related to incentives and acquisitions, along with lower sales. OpEx in Q4 was $518 million, up $26 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 21% in the prior year.
For the full year of 2021, revenue was $8.2 billion, up 10%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $120 million and the FX impact was $130 million favorable during the year. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 20.4% of sales versus 18.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.1 billion, up $282 million. And non-GAAP operating margins were 25.9% of sales, up from 24.8% of sales in the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. This increase in profitability also includes $100 million of higher employee incentive compensation earned in 2021.
GAAP earnings per share was $7.17 compared to $5.45 in the prior year, driven by higher sales, improved leverage, higher other income and lower reorganization charges in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $9.15, up 19% from $7.69 in 2020 on higher sales, higher operating earnings, higher other income, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate.
For the full year, OpEx was $1.9 billion, up $123 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2021 was 21% compared to 20% in the prior year on higher benefits from discrete items, including the benefits of stock comp expense booked in the prior year.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million, flat versus the prior year. And free cash flow was $635 million versus $637 million in the prior year. And for the full year, OCF was a record $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow was a record $1.6 billion versus $1.4 billion in the prior year. The increase in cash flow was driven by higher sales, higher earnings and partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Capital allocation for 2021 included $528 million of share repurchases at an average price of $208.41, $482 million in cash dividends and $457 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt, redeemed $324 million of outstanding debt, entered into a new upsized $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of only 1.6. We also increased our dividend 11%, our 11th consecutive year of a double-digit increase, and we announced a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program in the second quarter.
Moving to our segment results. Q4 Products and System Integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 1%, which was impacted by the supply constraints we discussed on the last call. Growth in video security and public safety LMR was offset by a decline in PCR. And revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $4 million. Operating earnings were $378 million or 25.3% of sales, down from 27% in the prior year, driven by higher employee incentive compensation and lower sales.
Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $98 million P25 upgrade for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, $94 million of APX NEXT device orders in North America, a $68 million P25 device upgrade for the District of Columbia, a $28 million P25 upgrade for a large U.S. customer, a $21 million fixed video security order for a large North America utility customer, a $19 million additional TETRA order from the German MOD and a $17 million TETRA device upgrade for a customer in Asia Pacific. And for the full year, revenue was $5 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and higher sales of video security.
Revenue from acquisitions was $89 million. Operating earnings were $976 million or 19.4% of sales, up from 19% in the prior year on higher sales, partially offset by higher OpEx.
Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $824 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security software and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $6 million. Operating earnings were $292 million or 35.4% of sales, up 150 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.
Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $25 million P25 multiyear services contract with Cook County, Illinois, a $17 million P25 multiyear software upgrade agreement for ICI Systems Authority in California, a $17 million body-worn camera as a service order for the City of Houston, Texas police department, a $15 million P25 multiyear software upgrade for Orange County, California and a $14 million additional body-worn camera order for the French MOI, a $11 million command center software hybrid cloud order for North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and we saw a 27% growth in software for video security and access control.
For the full year, revenue was $3.1 billion, up 13% on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $31 million. Operating earnings were $1.1 billion or 36.4% of sales, up 210 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.
Looking at regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 4% on growth in video security and LMR products and services. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.6 billion, up 11%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. International Q4 was $705 million, down 3% due to a decline in LMR, partially offset with growth in video security and command center software. We saw growth in Latin America during the quarter, while EMEA was flat and Asia Pac declined. For the full year, international revenue was $2.6 billion, up 9%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue was up in EMEA and Latin America, offset by a slight decline in Asia Pac.
Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record $13.6 billion, up $2.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the U.K. Home Office's exercise of their contractual right to extend the Airwave network 4 years through 2026, along with record LMR product orders and growth in Software and Services contracts in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $2.2 billion, driven by the Airwave extension and record LMR product orders in North America during the fourth quarter.
Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially, driven by the Airwave extension and growth in Software and Services agreements in North America. Products and SI backlog was up $886 million compared to last year, driven by record LMR orders. Sequentially, backlog was up $417 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter.
Turning next to our outlook for 2022. For the full year, we expect sales to be up approximately 7%, with mid-single-digit growth in products and systems integration and approximately 10% growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $9.80 and $9.95. This outlook assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. It also assumes $120 million of higher material costs, largely driven by the current semiconductor market dynamics of limited supply and us procuring available parts at a premium from other secondary markets. Additionally, we expect pricing adjustments to our portfolio, which we've recently made to take effect as we progress in fulfilling existing backlog.
For Q1, we expect sales to be up approximately 3%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.53 and $1.59 per share, inclusive of $50 million of the incremental material costs I referenced for the year. It also assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count between 173 million and 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.
We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. This OCF outlook include $75 million of higher employee incentive payments earned in 2021 and $150 million of higher cash taxes, half of which is driven by the U.S. federal tax requirement to capitalize R&D beginning in 2022. And for the full year, we will continue to be diligent in our cost management. We expect OpEx to be up approximately $100 million from last year, driven by investments in video security and command center software, inclusive of $40 million related to recent acquisitions.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. Let me just end this piece with a few additional thoughts. First, 2021 was an outstanding year for our company. We achieved record orders, sales, earnings and cash flow. We increased backlog, $2.2 billion. And we returned approximately $1 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we continue to invest in our video security and command center software offerings with the acquisitions of Openpath, Envysion and 911 Data Master.
Second, I'd like to provide you with a little bit more color on what we're currently seeing with supply and demand and how that impacts our current 2022 expectations. Demand across all 3 technologies was incredibly strong in 2021. In fact, it even accelerated in Q4. Like many companies, procuring semiconductor supply to meet our increasing demand has been challenging, and the environment in Q4 was even further impacted with supplier delays and the impact of the Omicron variant. In particular, delays from some semiconductor suppliers required us, as Jason just referenced, to substitute parts from alternative sources at higher costs, and this will impact margins for Q1 and Q2.
For the full year, we still expect solid revenue growth in the Products segment, driven by both video security and LMR products, inclusive of PCR. We've taken a careful look at our portfolio and made further pricing adjustments that we anticipate will take effect in the second half of the year and lead to 2022 full year gross margins that will be comparable and operating margins that will be slightly higher year-over-year.
Third, I'm really pleased with our position for growth. The funding environment for our customers continues to remain exceptionally strong. Our APX NEXT refresh cycle is gaining traction with our public safety customers with almost $100 million in Q4 orders alone. We continue to capture market share in our video security and command center software businesses and our recurring revenues continue to grow. And our balance sheet is stronger than ever, which allows us to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital in this current environment.
And finally, I'd like to just recognize all of the Motorola employees around the world who, despite the pandemic, have never wavered in their commitment to our customers and also in giving back. Last year, our foundation donated more than $12 million to charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered a record 65,000 hours in more than 40 countries. I'm incredibly proud of their efforts and of the recognition we continue to receive. We were recently named again to Fortune's Most Admired Companies and as one of the 100 Best ESG companies by Investor's Business Daily.
I'm also really pleased with our recent announcement that Dr. Ayanna Howard will be joining our Board. Her perspective and experience in AI and robotics will be invaluable as we continue advancing these technologies that deliver public safety and enterprise security.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions. Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?
Question-and-Answer Session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. I've got 1 question, and afterwards, I'll come back with a follow-up. Greg, can you talk a little bit about Airwave? Nice to see that signed for the 4-year extension. Could you talk a little bit at a high level about how we should think about economics of that deal pricing or anything relevant? And were there any other incremental opportunities potentially that -- or a part of that and any impact on the government kind of investigating your position in those networks? And then I've got a follow-up after that. Sure. Thanks, Tim. We were pleased about the extension of Airwave. The U.K. Home Office exercised their contractual right in December to extend it by 4 years to the end of 2026. Obviously, we welcome that. We think that's good news. We also think that's a continuing reflection of the criticality and the importance of what that network does for British first responders.
It was extended at contractual existing pricing. And having said that, we also, in parallel, continue to work with the Competition Markets Authority as they continue to progress with their investigation. We're actively engaged with them. And I think by their own time line, the CMA expects to conclude their work by, I think, sometime in the summer or the mid or end of summer, and we would update you accordingly. But we obviously feel good about this development, and we're very proud of the resilience and the investment we continue to make in Airwave. Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on the video end market. Numbers were good for the year, very good for the year. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the outlook there? You did 30%-plus growth this year. And also if you could weave into that kind of what you're seeing from some of these other -- whether it's NDAA and the potential for FCC involvement with Chinese players and how that could impact the growth profile for that business. Yes, Tim. I'm really pleased with the execution by Jack Molloy and John Kedzierski and Mahesh in our full Video Security and Access Control business. For the year, the category -- the technology category grew 32%, 21% organic, which I think is great. And for 2022, our outlook is and expectation is for video security and access control to grow approximately 20%.
When we look at the category in total, we think that market in the main is probably growing 7% or 8%. So the good news is we continue to take share. We've taken share in 2021. We can -- I believe we'll take share again in 2022. We're getting really good traction in the government vertical, which Avigilon had a very nascent presence in. We're updating and refreshing the product portfolio, both on fixed video, and of course, we acquired Pelco and Indigo Vision. We've refreshed the camera portfolio. We're doing more investment in software and analytics. Mahesh is leading the refresh around in-car and body-worn camera. And I'm also very pleased with the Openpath acquisition we did earlier.
I like our execution. The addressable market in 2022 is now, we believe, $18 billion, $3 billion larger than last year. We're taking share. We're growing and I like our outlook. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe to follow up on some of the comments on the video side and specific to the deal you announced at the Houston police department on body cameras. I guess, I know they had paused their deployment a couple of years ago and cited concerns around technology as the reason. I'm wondering if you could give some color on maybe some of the development or improvements you made there in light of the refreshes you mentioned and like just what the lift was from a tech perspective and if that's mostly done. Sure, Erik. It's Jack. So you're correct. When we originally acquired WatchGuard a few years back, they had had some quality issues with Houston. We put the full team's focus on improving the quality, both from a back-end standpoint as well as from a device standpoint. We've also pivoting our offer in the body-worn space to an as a service offer, and we think that was compelling for the City of Houston.
At the end of the day, we've got long-standing and broad relationships with the City of Houston. I think they trusted us as MSI, as Motorola Solutions to come and fix the appropriate quality issues as we have throughout our history. And I think we're going to have a real happy customer there.
As it relates to body worn in general, it's probably also important to highlight that for the full year, our orders more than doubled. Q4 '21 was a record orders quarter for us. And I'd also highlight that moving forward, we're really well positioned for growth internationally. We think that, in general, the market has wanted an alternative. And as Greg said, we believe we're taking share both domestically and internationally in the body-worn space. Awesome. And then maybe just on the supply chain side. It seems like you're mostly seeing headwinds in PCR just based on growth rates. But are you also seeing them kind of across the board in video as well, just less severe? If anything kind of from product-wise you could give color on would be helpful. Yes, Erik, we -- the incremental material semiconductor costs of $120 million for all of '22 is primarily LMR, which is inclusive of PCR. There's also some video in there as well, but we expect the incremental material semiconductor cost to be about $50 million in Q1, $50 million in Q2 and $20 million in the back half as we make progress fulfilling backlog and we have taken additional pricing increases. As the year progresses, our leverage will improve from a P&L and operating earnings standpoint. And on PCR, even with the supply constraints on the year that it had, it grew in 2021 9% to just over $800 million. So despite the supply chain and backlog in that PCR space that were yet to deliver, it grew 9%. Our next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Greg, I wanted to start on the record backlog. Just to be clear, is that something that you can reprice? Or is that locked in? Because the concern would be that margin compression might last a little bit longer if prices are locked in and costs remain elevated. So maybe you could touch on the dynamics there. Yes. I think pricing and backlog is largely fixed and cannot be repriced. I think that's informing the guide we're giving you both for the full year and the linearity of the impact of margins of Q1 and Q2 primarily. But the backlog is as strong as I've ever seen it. And even if you take the extension of Airwave out, it also was still really strong in LMR and PCR as well. I'd also point to the services of our backlog is -- as the largest part of our backlog. And within it, our multiyear services contracts, many of them do have a pricing mechanism around price escalation. So Services and Software has a little bit of a hedge there on parts of the business. Good point, Jason. Got it. And maybe just a quick clarification on that. Some investors might be concerned that we have price increases coming in the back half of the year and maybe some of this record backlog that we're seeing as some pull forward of demand ahead of those price increases. What would you say to those investors? I'm sure you thought about that. So the bulk of our backlog, again, is direct customers, their public safety in nature. They order when they need things, and we're prioritizing them. We do have a channels business as well, record low inventory levels among the channel. And we're prioritizing the demand signal from them, which we believe to be very clean. So in terms of pull forward and pricing strategies, we've been adjusting price for a number of quarters, and our backlog has been largely unaffected. And Jason, we obviously track canceled orders, and canceled orders have been de minimis throughout the 2021. Got it. If I could just get a quick clarification for Jason. It's so unusual for us to deal with the $50 million hit in Q1 and the implied margin. Is there any way for you to help us with margin by segment? Because I'm trying to understand if there's also a step down in Services and Software margin implied in this guidance. The bulk of the $50 million is related to our supply lines around semiconductor, which are embedded in the products, primarily LMR. So the bulk of that $50 million or that $50 million is within the Products segment. Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Just a follow-up on the supply chain questions here. Obviously, it's going to get a lot of attention. We're hearing from other people as well that it's just not semiconductors that we're seeing supply chain issues on. Are you guys seeing issues on any other of the components of [indiscernible] materials? And is that perhaps popping up with some frequency over the past few months? And do you have any idea about how it looks for the next few months? The supply chain environment is challenging on the front, Keith, of freight being elevated, which we talked about and most companies are having to navigate those higher prices. The material cost drivers that we've highlighted as incremental this year are entirely around obtaining supply for semiconductors. There are other general price pressures within supply chain, but we are mitigating those. They are not the key challenge that we have. We've navigated those. It's really freight and it's semiconductors.
We have a higher inventory position, too, Keith, I'll point you to on the balance sheet, nearing $800 million of inventory. So we're creating a buffer for the other categories of parts beyond semiconductors so that when the available semiconductors are delivered, that we have the right matching of componentry. So I'd say our key challenges and continuing are around supply chain of semis. And just following up on that. Is the issue here just the fact that you guys are -- either demand is greater than you perhaps originally forecasted for or just that your original suppliers are unable to meet your demand and others? It's both. Our demand has increased, but our original demand signal has not been delivered. We've had delivery delays from a handful of semiconductor suppliers. That's in part what we pointed to and what's driving the incremental costs of $120 million this year. Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. I guess I wanted to ask about stimulus. If I go back to 2020, if memory serves, I think you said you got $150 million in incremental benefit from the CARES Act on revenue. And I was wondering if you have a comparable number for 2021. Obviously, ARPA might be more of the benefit there. And then also, as you look at your guidance for 2022, what kind of stimulus benefit do you think you have baked into that guidance? Sure, George. So maybe to start, from a CARES perspective, in 2021, we had about $50 million last year in CARES. And really, the conversations have pivoted to the American rescue plan. As we highlighted, $350 billion available to state and local and then $170 billion available to schools, which is, interestingly enough, one of our biggest vertical solutions for video security and access control. So the funding environment, not only from a stimulus perspective, but actually from a state and local budgets and receipts perspective, has been as good as we've ever seen in my -- really in the history of my business.
But probably more importantly, Jason highlighted it, Greg highlighted it, it's making sure that we've got the attractive portfolio to meet to do that. And so things like APX NEXT and device refresh from an LMR perspective, things like driving new camera portfolio, investing in analytics and AI and the video security, I think, have positioned and married well with the stimulus opportunities, which is what you're seeing in backlog and I think future demand. Yes. The other thing to note is, as you know, this ARPA money is multiyear in duration. So the $350 billion that Jack talked about, the $170 billion, and there's more, some of this multiyear funding goes all the way out to the end of 2024. When you take that visibility of funding, in addition to state and local tax receipts being robust, and then you combine some of the other regulatory things around NDAA, but also more recently, the Secure Equipment Act where the FCC has been directed to direct certain Chinese companies and prevent them from competing like Hytera in LMR or Hikvision in Dahua for fixed video for state and local opportunities in the U.S., that's an incremental benefit as well. So the environment is strong. Got it. And then any sense for what you've got embedded in your revenue guidance for this year from stimulus? Jack, maybe you can talk about the funnel development. But in terms of it -- it's implied in the both products growth and SNS growth for the year. Yes. And I think we look at -- we track our ARP funding as well and the pipeline to start '22 just to mentalize it over '21 is up. But again, I think it's more important -- I think equally as important as the stimulus funding is just the condition of state and local budgets in general. Our next question will come from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Greg, I believe you mentioned in your scripted remarks how government demand has been elevated, particularly for the Avigilon video solutions. Is that primarily driven by the Secure Equipment Act from the federal government that you just mentioned? And like how big of an opportunity do you have to take share from some of the Chinese vendors such as Hikvision that are deployed across the federal government and for local government accounts? Yes, Louie, thank you. I think our growth is coming for a variety of reasons. I think it's the portfolio we have, the investment Molloy has made in go-to-market, the refresh that Mahesh is doing on mobile video. Yes, I do think NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, for the federal government is a beneficial tailwind. Jack talked about on the last call, we were targeting $330 million of the overall fixed video and access control category to be yielded from government customers. We actually exceeded that. It was closer to slightly above $350 million. So yes, I think we will continue to take share and grow our business in the government vertical. But I also think we'll take it -- continue to take share in commercial enterprise as well. One other thing I'd feather in, Greg, just is we talked about our Pelco acquisition and what that meant in terms of bringing federal government contracts, and we actually have invested in a refresh of that portfolio, which I think will be critically important for our federal government business. It dovetails with all things NDAA Secure Communications Act in 2022 and beyond. And Greg, just to clarify, the $350 million number you mentioned is both mobile and fixed video... Total. That's right. Into government. It serves all of the great portfolio. Mahesh has around mobile and in-car, complemented by fixed video, a market that was nascent for Avigilon just 3 years ago. So it's been a good market for us and continue to be. Great. And Greg, you also mentioned accelerating demand like during the fourth quarter. Was there any particular end customer for which the demand was the most pronounced? Such as -- like are you seeing the most demand from like local and state, like law enforcement customers? Or is it from the federal government or commercial? I was just wondering if you could parse out where you're seeing the strongest demand. I think we entered Q4 with strong demand. And then it got -- it did accelerate in Q4. The end user that I would highlight is probably the public safety customers for APX NEXT. We had high expectations. We've spent a lot of time improving, refreshing the APX NEXT that Jack has referenced. Orders and demand increased. It was outstanding in Q4. And we also introduced the APX XN fire radio. We have plans to introduce a mid-tier APX NEXT. And if I were to highlight, Louie, 1 area, although demand was fairly broad, I would highlight the APX NEXT public safety users in North America. And as Jack's already referenced, I think we're in the early innings of that APX NEXT refresh cycle. Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. I don't think I heard you all say it. I apologize if you did, but Greg, Jason, can you tell us what growth -- how much of growth is being taken away by supply chain? What would growth look like in '22 buffer supply chain? Well, I would say this. So we talked about overall demand being strong. It accelerated in Q4. Paul, you know we ended the year with record backlog. We're providing full year revenue guidance of 7%. That is in the context of semiconductor constraints that we think will be throughout most of 2022. It also is guidance that incorporates a $60 million headwind for FX. So we certainly don't have any demand problem in this environment. It's a supply-constrained environment.
And when I think about, look, how much better could it be, look, I think if supply was more free flowing, I think we could have growth in 2022 that wouldn't be too much dissimilar from the year we just completed. So demand is strong. And we're navigating it, and we're -- I'm pleased with the execution that the team is doing.
As we look at supply, yes, we're buying broker parts at higher cost. We're looking for substitute alternatives. Molloy and Scott Mottonen on the engineering side are doing real-time product design, redesign work. That takes a little bit of time. We're carrying longer, higher inventory. We are entering into longer-term supply agreements where we can with certain semiconductor providers. So I think we're doing a lot in parallel, but demand is strong. Greg, to be clear, I'm not questioning that demand is strong. I was just hoping you get quantification. But I hear you saying that growth this year could look like 10% buffer supply constraints. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think that's what I just heard you say. I would say not too dissimilar from last year. So you could take that within the contours of that. But clearly, it's stronger than 7% and the $60 million of headwind with FX. But yes, Paul, I think you're absolutely directionally on it. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, I apologize if you [indiscernible] previously. But on the Hytera question specifically, and I know I'm asking to speculate here, but given that it's now a criminal action and a thought arises that I suspect that could shut them down or effectively shut them down throughout the U.S. and perhaps in other regions outside of China as well. Any thoughts on how good the -- and I recognize it's going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight. But if that criminal action proceeds, it ends up in the same place as civil action did, what could be the impact to your business from a revenue growth and profitability standpoint? Well, first of all, I was happy to see the DOJ earlier this week announced 21 count criminal indictment of Hytera for conspiracy. It is separate than our civil actions. It doesn't change our strategy on the pending civil litigation, Paul. And now as a result of a series of judgments, they owe us in excess of $670 million, separate from the criminal actions that the DOJ just announced. They are effectively shut down in the U.S. and Australia and Germany. I think this will put incrementally more pressure on them.
Look, we're in a multiyear campaign. There's nothing more important, nothing, Paul, than our intellectual property and the innovation that we invest in. We will continue to defend it. We will fiercely continue to pursue collection. I don't mind spending the money and we'll do what we need to do to get appropriate remuneration back from Hytera. It was a very concerted multiyear campaign where they stole, and we're going to get them to pay for it.
I like the fact that the DOJ announced their criminal indictment, but I look at that as kind of 2 different parallel streams and doesn't interfere with our focus and perseverance and determination around our civil litigation. Greg, just to be clear to your comment, you're saying independent of the criminal action, based on the outcome of the civil litigation, if I recall, I think the damages were reduced to $545 million, but you've got a very hefty royalty stream in perpetuity. You're telling us that, that royalty stream and the damages will effectively shut Hytera down, including the PCR market, whether or not that criminal investigation yields a verdict against Hytera. I think that our actual judgments are over $670 million when you add in attorney's fees and prejudgment interest and trial costs and so on. I think -- I'm just saying in the main, Paul, I think the pressure on this company is so great. In the U.S., I'd be surprised if they're able to continue to operate going forward. We'll see, but we're going to pursue all of our collections. And if it includes asset seizure, we'll do that, too. But we're not going to let people, anybody, steal our product or trade secrets or intellectual property. As it should be. Good for you. Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Thank you, by the way, for all the color on the various elements on the questions that were asked earlier. The couple of questions I have is, when you think about pricing for your products, and I'm referring mainly to LMR, what is the average price increase that you guys are thinking about to put into the actual list pricing of LMR products? So maybe we'll start off there. Sure. So we've been looking at the portfolio and implementing surgical adjustments through Q3 and Q4. It really depends on the portfolio and how we stack up competitively. We've been adjusting not only list prices, but also discount management and programs, which can also yield higher sales and lower discounts. It's tough to put a number on it in aggregate. It's going to be an improvement and a real help to offset the costs that we talked about in the second half. So the series of actions in aggregate that we put together will offset a large part of the pricing of the cost increases that we mentioned incrementally. That's why the bulk of the $120 million of increased semiconductor costs is in the first half, $100 million of it. $20 million of it is in the second half, and that's in part because of the actions we put in place. So just safe to assume that the minimum price increases will offset the increases in costs, the surgical costs. That's like your -- that's the standard base case, right, the floor. And then this doesn't take into account if customers are opting into order in APX NEXT, which is technically a much higher ASP radio compared to the rest of the portfolio. Is that the right way to think about what's going on? So mix changes in the portfolio enhancements we make, like APX NEXT, are contemplated as we plan any given year, right? And in the mid-tier APX NEXT that Greg mentioned that's coming into the portfolio, that may come at a price premium to its successor, is factored into our base case. The price increases that we're referring to are in the -- incremental to that around prices of products that perhaps are more aged and not new products, but rather products that have been in the market for a bit. We've looked at that across the portfolio with Jack's team around the elasticity of our entire portfolio. Got it. Got it. So 1 last question. When I think about the 7% number you're guiding to for 2022, how much of that is price increases? And how much of that is units and volume being shipped? The majority of that, of the 7% growth is volume increases. Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Greg, I wanted to start with a question around America Rescue Plan Act. And specifically, I'm curious your thoughts about how you look at the incrementality of that funding versus maybe what was already a strong steady state budget? And then the second part, maybe for Jack, also America Rescue Plan Act-related, any behavior you're seeing from customers where you think they are in figuring out where they're going to spend this money, how much they've got, relative size of projects? Any color around that would be helpful. Yes, Ben, I would actually say, and I think Jack referenced this earlier, I think there is a strong steady state to begin with around these budgets before you get to Recovery Act money. I think that the narrative a year ago was deep on the police. I think we've seen a reversal of that hyperbole politically, but we're also seeing more and more investment. People know that they need investment and more modern and secure infrastructure to protect these communities. And we're seeing that across the board. So I think steady state is stronger. I think the sentiment around police investment is different than it was several quarters ago, and then you layer on ARPA. And so, Ben, as we talked about, ARPA is a multiyear -- it's multiyear in terms of how we'll draw down that money. I want to point out, there was important clarification that was directed by the United States Treasury Department in early January. They issued a final guidance, which was actually a few hundred pages long. That guidance, and this is really important, they made several references to how that money was to be used, namely law enforcement equipment technology and there are various different caveats, but that was very important. Pointed to things like P25 infrastructure, P25 devices that those funding were able to be pointed towards, obviously, the products that we make.
So I think that was very beneficial. But again, as I said, I think it's one thing to have the funding, but it's more important to have the portfolio that resonates to them. And I think as we've said across the 3 technology segments, we're the market leader, and we believe we're taking share. Our next question will come from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. So just a quick one from me on gross margin. So nice performance here to end the year kind of despite some freight costs. You mentioned kind of flattish '22 margin performance maybe on some of these lingering freight. But as we look out to '23, hopefully, these costs come down, some product mix benefits kind of continue and then these price increases hold. So can we see a gross margin step-up in '23 based on those trends? Sure. So the $120 million that is incremental that we've been talking about on this call regarding supply lines for semiconductors is not a structural. It's temporary. We're having to pay a premium because the available supply from the committed suppliers isn't necessarily there. And so as a result, we're paying a premium, a markup, if you will, competing in the open market for other manufacturers who need the same part.
So as we think about what happens to those costs over time, hence, the market and semiconductor manufacturers, all of whom are working to increase capacity, all of whom are working to fulfill our needs, and we have excellent relationships with the suppliers that we're navigating through this journey with, as those things improve, those costs get mitigated. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Greg, you mentioned that kind of steady state or continual demand remains pretty strong. And then when we add in the additional government stimulus like AARP, the American Rescue Plan and such, I'm wondering, are we reaching a point now where first responders are looking at some major changes like to their command centers? It seems like from a lot of the work that we do, that the command centers are pretty antiquated, out of date and could be a lot more technologically advanced, informative and helpful. And I'm just wondering, those are big decisions to make, almost like new whiteboard stuff and put in completely new systems. I'm wondering, does this give us kind of over that hump or over that worry or concern to where now they can actually implement even more effective tools in command centers? I think, Jim, the high-level answer is yes because it fuels overall demand and funds for those changes. But you also know that command center is software and their existing tools is one that embeds existing inertia and workflows. And it's actually -- yes, it's available funding that can fund those transitions, but it's also the reinvention on transformation of employee, public habits and workflow that's more embedded.
So I still think it will take time. Sales cycles are a little bit longer. And as we do that, as Mahesh and Jack talked about last time, we're looking to move more sales along a hybrid strategy of meeting customers where they are so it could be a prem solution. It could be a SaaS subscription solution. But as we sell more of those transitions, we expect it to be more of a annual recurring revenue and less of a CapEx purchase, which will elongate kind of the revenue recognition over time. And clearly, it's a positive, though.
Mahesh, did you want to add something? No. Okay. Jack? No. Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. For all of the Motorola people listening, I want to thank you for not just your perseverance during a challenging Q4 with Omicron and additional supply constraints, but for the whole year. You've been unwavering, and you've allowed us and fueled our capability to achieve a lot of the record results that we talked about this afternoon.
Demand is strong. As I mentioned, it got stronger in Q4, and we're very proud of the fact that we ended the year with record backlog. The funding environment, which we just talked about, again, it just remains exceptional. We're growing and taking share in all 3 technologies. By the way, our total Software business in 2021 is approaching $1 billion, if you count all software. And we expect it to exceed $1 billion in 2022. And even with the $120 million of incremental material semiconductor costs and $60 million of FX headwinds, we still expect to grow approximately 7% and expand operating margins as well.
Conditions like this, while challenging, also present great opportunities, inorganic and organic. And with our balance sheet, our firepower, we have every intention of deploying capital strategically, surgically, but to continue to drive significant shareholder value creation.
I appreciate everybody on the call. And to all the Motorolans, I'm really proud of you and grateful for everything you're doing. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

I would now like to pass the conference over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, may begin your conference. Welcome to our 2022 first quarter earnings call. With me today are, Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during the during the conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, I'm really pleased with our strong start to the year, as we achieved sales and earnings per share above our guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic and supply chain environment that we continue to navigate. During the quarter we saw a record Q1 orders and record Q1 sales, highlighted by our video security and access control business, which grew 21% in revenue with even higher growth in orders. We also finished the quarter with a record Q1 ending backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year.
Second, we continue to see strong demand across all three technologies, driven in part by a robust funding environment for our customers. In land mobile radio, we're seeing continued investment in regional, statewide and even countrywide networks that further reinforces the longevity and criticality of this technology. And in our higher growth areas of video and command center software, our investments in cloud and artificial intelligence are differentiating us from our competitors. Total software revenue was up 17% during the quarter, including 28% growth in software for our video security and access control business and 9% growth in command center software.
And finally, our expectation for full-year guidance remains unchanged. As the years progressed -- as this year has progressed, we've seen incremental headwinds related to higher freight costs, a stronger dollar and the dilutive impact to be Ava Security acquisition. However, these headwinds are being offset by further pricing actions, stronger demand, favorable mix and targeted cost reductions.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.9 billion, up 7% and above our guidance, driven primarily by better than anticipated supply for LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $17 million and currency headwinds were $18 million. GAAP operating earnings of $239 million and operating margins of 12.6% compared to 16.8% of sales in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $374 million, down $37 million or 9% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 19.8% of sales, down from 23%. This decline in operating earnings was primarily due to the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs that we outlined on our last call, related to the acquiring critical supply in the secondary market for semiconductors. Additionally, we saw higher freight costs driven by elevated air freight rates and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.
GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.41 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a deferred tax benefit in the current quarter related to the reorganization of intellectual property. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 per share compared to a $1.87 last year, a decrease primarily due to the operating earnings impact I described related to higher semiconductor and freight costs and increased operating expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales and a lower tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $492 million, up $37 million versus last year, primarily due to higher expenses related to M&A, investments in video and higher selling costs commensurate with our higher sales.
Turning next to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $152 million, compared with $370 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $98 million compared to $318 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to our planned increase in inventory as we invest to meet the strong product demand we're seeing from our customers in video and LMR.
Capital allocation for Q1 included $493 million in share repurchases, $134 million paid in cash dividends and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter we closed the acquisitions of Ava Security for $387 million and TETRA Ireland for $120 million. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Calipsa, a leader in cloud-based advanced video analytics for $40 million. And just earlier today, we announced the acquisition of Videotec, a global supplier of pan-tilt-zoom and explosion proof cameras for $22 million. Videotec enhances our portfolio of NDAA compliant fixed video cameras.
Moving next to our segment results. Q1 Products and System Integration sales were $1.1 billion, up 9%, driven by anticipated strong growth in video and better supply availability in LMR. Revenue acquisition from acquisitions in the quarter was $7 million and currency headwinds were $8 million. Operating earnings were $96 million or 8.7% of sales, down from 12.9% in the prior year, driven by the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.
Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include an over $60 million nationwide P25 order for Taiwan National Police, $20 million of P25 upgrade orders for Los Angeles, Unified School District, a $14 million TETRA upgrade for the Israeli railways, $11 million P25 expansion for a large US customer and a $5 million video order for a large US public school system.
Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $789 million, up 4% from last year. Revenue from acquisitions was $10 million and currency headwinds were also $10 million. Growth in this segment was driven by video security and command center software, while LMR services was approximately flat as expected due to the impact of a tough comp related to customers P25 system upgrades that were concentrated in the first quarter of 2021 due to the COVID delays throughout 2020 and the impact of unfavorable FX.
Operating earnings were $278 million or 35% of sales, down 170 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales. For the full year we still expect software and services revenue growth of 10% and we expect operating margins that are comparable to last year with the dilutive impact of recent M&A offset by pricing and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include $27 million command center software order for a customer in Latin America, a $20 million US federal multi-year service contract orders, $8 million command center software record management order for the City of Phoenix and an $8 million services agreement with the City of Chicago. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 28%. And subsequent to the quarter end, we launched the Public Safety Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information sharing and intelligence hub for the public safety community.
Looking next at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% and growth across all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $587 million, flat versus last year with growth in video security and command center software, offset by a decline in LMR due to FX. We saw growth in Latin America and Asia-Pac, while Europe was slightly down, primarily due to FX.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of ‘21 and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was down $115 million driven primarily by the Airwave and ESN revenue burn during the quarter, partially offset by growth in LMR and video products.
Software and -- Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $320 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $221 million or 2%, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter and typical order seasonality in North America. Products and SI backlog was $852 million compared to last year and up $106 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR and video demand in both regions.
We entered the year with a record backlog position and approximately $2.2 billion of our beginning backlog in the product segment was scheduled to be delivered in 2022 with over two-thirds of this amount expected to be delivered in the first half. We saw continued strong demand for new orders during the quarter with a record Q1 orders total that included comprehensive pricing actions we implemented across our portfolio in January. We expect these new orders at higher prices together with higher volumes in the second half to lead to a significant profitability ramp throughout the year.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 4% and 5% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.83 and $1.88 per share. This assumes approximately $50 million of FX headwinds, a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. It also includes $50 million of year-over-year increased cost that we described on our last earnings call related to elevated material cost for semiconductor supply from secondary markets.
For the full year, we are maintaining our prior revenue guidance of 7% growth and non-GAAP EPS guidance between $9.80 and $9.95 per share despite the significant strengthening of the US dollar since our last call. We now expect FX to be a headwind of $170 million for the year, up $110 million from our prior guidance. This outlook now assumes a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares based on the timing of our share repurchases in the year and an effective tax rate of 21% to 21.5%.
Additionally, our full year operating cash flow guidance for approximately $1.9 billion and full year OpEx expectations of approximately $100 million increase over last year are also unchanged, inclusive of the new acquisitions we announced, offset by targeted reductions we're making.
Before I turn the call back to Greg I wanted to reiterate some of the proactive measures we've been taking to navigate this dynamic environment. First, amid strong demand we've taken further pricing actions across various parts of our portfolio, which we expect to benefit our second half of the year. We remain cost disciplined with targeted OpEx cost planned, while funding our recent acquisitions. We are strategically investing in inventory to maximize the parts availability to fulfill the strong demand that we're seeing. And finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, maintaining a strong balance sheet to be opportunistic and deploying capital on acquisitions and shareholder returns.
I would now like to turn the call back to Greg. Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, business remains really strong despite the ongoing macroeconomic and semiconductor challenges. We had record Q1 orders and sales that drove results above our expectations. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever and our higher growth businesses in video security and command center software continue to grow at a multiple of their overall markets.
Second, our healthy balance sheet and durable cash flow provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital. During the quarter we closed two additional acquisitions I'm excited about TETRA Ireland, the provider of Ireland's nationwide digital radio service for first responders is a business. We've had our eye on for a while actually and it adds to our strong LMR managed services business, and Ava Security, a scalable, secure and flexible cloud solution provides customers with the benefits of an enterprise grade video security solution, while minimizing the physical footprint of their security infrastructure. Ava complements our on-prem offerings in fixed video security and provides us with the flexibility to meet our customers where they are with options for both cloud or on-prem solutions.
And finally, while the macroeconomic environment remains turbulent, I like our position. We're a leader in the markets we serve. We provide need to have solutions that are critical for customers. We continue to invest heavily in R&D, and all of this provides us with the ability to take continued pricing actions to manage higher cost pressures. Additionally, we have strong predictable cash flows that allows us to continue to invest in our growth businesses, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, guys. I appreciate the opportunity here. It sounds like you guys have been able to navigate the supply chain challenges fairly well. I know you got $50 million in extra cost for the first quarter, but can you guys talk about the supply visibility into supply for the rest of the year. Obviously [indiscernible] things going on at Shanghai recently, but any updated thoughts on where supply chain stands today? Hey, Keith. I think our view of supply chain is, it's pretty much unchanged from where it was a quarter ago. It's still very challenging, we go through week by week negotiations and discussions with critical suppliers on allocations. On the good news side, I think we were more successful in Q1 getting some critical parts sooner than expected. And I think that drove an informed our over performance in Q1. The overall environment around semiconductor constraints remains challenging. I think, Keith, realistically we expect those challenges to exist throughout the rest of 2022. And Keith, you mentioned the %50 million in Q1, it's another $50 million in Q2. So as we set out the year and described in the last call $100 million is elevated cost that we're incurring to buy these parts at a premium in the first half, but the second half is only $20 million, that's in part driven by the elevated costs that we faced last year with comp. But secondly, in terms of our supply and what our teams are doing to increase the number of substitutable parts, the engineering and quality teams are doing a good job in finding alternative parts and doing well in that. And we've also shifted to air as our primary means of freight, that's what's elevating our freight costs a little bit to get the parts in a timely fashion. [Multiple Speakers] semiconductor constraint is largely unchanged. As Jason dimensionalize although freight is incrementally gotten worse as we shift more ocean to air and the overall cost is higher than was anticipated on our last call, but anticipated and included in our full year guidance. Got you. Just as a follow-up, you guys had a really strong first quarter for bookings, is there the capability -- despite the challenges are you able to get enough supply to get over and above your guidance if the demand was there? Our guidance for the quarter and the year is compilation of the demand and the match to the supply that we have and foresee in terms of delivery. So nothing has changed there. We overperformed in Q1, largely because we were able to get the supply and allocate it purposely to parts of the portfolio, like public safety that are important to customers, they also happen to have slightly higher ASPs. Got you. Thanks guys. Good luck. Thanks, Keith. Thank you, Keith. The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. You may proceed. Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to just quiz you on the full year guidance. You're keeping the 7%, but it seems like there is a lot of moving parts in there. And I'm just wondering how it all kind of nets out. So you have $110 million of additional FX headwinds, you've got a bunch of new M&A deals in here, pricing has gone up. I guess I'm wondering what it looks like when you kind of peel all that back? Is your guidance better or worse than maybe you thought three months ago? You mentioned $110 million I FX, that's absolutely correct. The incremental M&A that's -- that we've acquired since we last talked is $60 million. Additionally – Of net new revenue in the period. Additionally, in terms of -- you mentioned price, we're absolutely looking at that and have made some changes across the portfolio. And the third item is, favorable mix. So what we -- where we prioritize and allocate our supply to. We acquired Ava and Ava is about $0.10 dilutive to EPS for the full year. So net-net, we've got incremental headwinds as you talked about George of FX, incremental headwinds with freight, some M&A higher costs than our last call. But that's balanced out by favorable mix, particularly as we index toward higher tier shipments. We continue to take pricing actions. I think tax rate will be a little bit better and share count will be lower. So all in all -- and by the way, at the end of the day I think demand is as strong or maybe even stronger today than it was back in February. Got it. And then just continuing on that. Could you give us a sense for the magnitude of the pricing increases and I think you said January was the time you institutes those. Is that correct? And then, when do you think those will be fully in the model? So we've been looking at price for a number of quarters, the most recent ones where January. I mentioned on the call that the backlog that we began the year with was $2.2 billion, that's largely going to fuel the first half. So the orders January onwards are going to fuel the second half and that's where our most recent pricing actions are. When I think about products, the segment in terms of what's driving the growth we expect this year for our product segment of mid-single digit growth. Within LMR the driver is largely price and mix favorability. And then within video, which is the higher growth part, it's price and volume that are driving the growth we expect there. Got it. All right. Super. Thank you very much. Thanks, George. Thank you, George. The next question is from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is now open. Paul, please check the issue, you are now muted. My apologies. Guys, I apologize if you answered this in your prepared remarks, but with the improvement in some of your key sectors in your professional inter-PCR business. Are you seeing that translates to an improved outlook. Hospitality has obviously improved significantly, oil and gas prices are up, albeit I'm not sure how much that's improved that industry, but are you seeing any improvement there? So with PCR, we expect it to grow this year mid-single digits. it was flat in Q1. The demand for PCR is very robust, the limiting or gating item is supply around PCR. So Jack, if you want to talk about markets. Paul, I think that -- the two markets that we've seen the most profound rebound kind of post COVID have been air transportation and hospitalities. I think the next to follow will be commercial real estate as we get people back to work in major cities. We're starting to see upgrade even in our building. We'll see upgrades on the communications front there, but it's really been air and hospitality this year. Yeah. For my follow-up, I appreciate you just increased prices, but everybody is citing stepped up component costs, any thoughts you can share on longer-term margins where they go and in what timeframe on the gross line. Sure. So headline inflation we’re navigating it like all companies and have been planning for a significant inflation number that we've been seeing. We have two cost inflation items that we believe are temporal. One, we're paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available directly from the manufacturer and getting them through alternative secondary markets, that's a $120 million that is in the P&L this year as we get after that critical supply. Secondly, the freight levels that we're incurring this year, also air rates are frankly high, they got higher after the Ukraine invasion and they remain high. So those are two temporary items that we’re navigating around, as well as general inflation. Yeah. And Paul, I would also say that taking all those things into account, we still expect full year gross margins to be comparable for MSI and operating margins to be slightly up for full year 2022. Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great, thanks. Maybe starting, I noticed you guys talked about strong order activity kind of across the board, but just wanted to get a sense of was there any changes by region. So anything notable in the Europe region, maybe more specifically. Maybe I start with that and then I have a follow-up question. Sure, Mata. I think as it replies to Europe. First of all, I just want to remind you, half of our revenue in Europe is actually recurring revenue, so think large scale managed service businesses. In Q1, internationally, we have been up 3% -- were up 3% in constant currency, so really the FX headwind that Jason alluded to really impacted Europe to the greatest extent. But I would say this, our challenges in Europe and really quite frankly in international are not demand related. Demand remains very robust, it remains very robust in Europe, not only in video security and access control, but our command center software as well as our land mobile business. So I think the biggest challenge I would say is really currency right now. And Meta, just as a footnote, as it relates to Russia, contextually we've exited that market. It was pretty de minimis for us to begin with. Full year revenue on Russia last year was $25 million. So we've exited that market. We don't have Motorola Solutions employees in that theater any longer. So just as a footnote, I thought that could be helpful as well. Perfect. Very helpful. And then maybe just on the -- I just wanted to get a sense of you guys obviously spoke to growing backlog, just how much of the growing backlog is a result of supply chain challenges and inability to ship versus just some longer-term contracts coming in. Thanks. And that's it for me. Majority of our backlog is from direct customers, governments, agencies, thousands of customers who order as their procurement cycles permit them. And so we believe that to be a very strong signal for their demand. We also have a channels business where channel inventories are very low and our channel partners are placing orders on us to replenish that inventory. So our demand signal from our -- both our direct customers and our indirect customers is pretty clean. And as Jack mentioned it is growing in both sides of the business. Perfect. Thanks. Congrats guys. Thanks, Meta. Thank you, Meta. The next question is from the line of Sam Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Great, thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate on our ARPA contribution. I know you guys put a couple of senses or sense in your press release, can you just walk us through contribution from explicitly ARPA that you guys are estimating. Hey, Sam, it's Jack. First of all, I want to -- we said it before, but it's important to first of all point out this, ARPA will be a multi-year phenomenon. So our team is actually -- whey we look at our pipeline, which is our sales funnel, we've actually seen the three time increase over this period last year. So that's great. And a lot of that is really directed at the $350 billion in state and local, which really -- we've never had a problem as it relates to where we needs to have business, but what it really does, it draws clarity to how those deals get funded. And so we'll be in that for the next 2.5, three years.
The second area where it's been very helpful is with our fixed video security and access control business, particularly around the education vertical where people are really trying to -- as they bring kids back to school, trying to make sure those places are safe. Actually investing in things like concealed weapons technology with our evolved partnership as well. So we think the money [indiscernible] which is $170 billion there will also be -- will benefit us over the course of the next three years as well. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, maybe for you Jack again. Any update on body worn camera or fixed cameras that go on to the vehicles like first responder vehicles. Could you give us an update on that and growth rates or any kind of comments on market share? Absolutely. So first of all, as it relates to -- as it relates to the body worn. I talked about last year from a market share context, last year we doubled our orders, in 2021 doubled our orders in a market that certainly didn't double. So we felt like we took share. As it relates to Q1 2022, our orders were up double-digit. And I think most importantly there were up double-digit against a comp, whereby last year we grew 65% in orders in Q2.
And I think the only thing I'd add is, we announced our as a service offer last year, we've actually seen acceleration in customers' willingness to choose the cloud there. So, we've said before, we think that the market wants an alternative. We've got good relationships internationally and in North America our team continues to fight for their fair share. Let me just add to that [Multiple Speakers] we launched the M500 last year, it started shipping a few months ago, a little bit earlier this year. The M500 we consider to be a significant leap up from our prior generation [Ferrari] (ph). And it builds upon a lot of the goodness that the Ferrari had and Ferrari from the WatchGuard legacy really has evolved with a lot of customer feedback. Critically for the M500 we have added some significant new AI capabilities. This is a platform that's really meant to deliver AI capabilities. At launch we launched it with two capabilities effectively officer and passenger safety, but in addition ALPR as well. And the ALPR stream actually contributes to the other sets of ALPR cameras we have in our portfolio. These feed into one of the largest -- the industry's largest license plate databases that we have. Right now we're exceeding $50 billion of plate rates.
And to give you an idea of, like the rate at which it gets refreshed, in Q1 of this year we accounted for about $2.4 billion plate rate and to give you understanding of the frequency at which we are growing here compared to the previous year, we doubled the plate rate. So overall from a mobile video standpoint and in ALPR standpoint we're doing fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, Sami. The next question is from the line of Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. The first question, I was hoping you could share any thoughts around customer priorities with respect to command center software and refresh? And just talk to any execution you're seeing. How you think you're doing? How it's developing? Kind of where it's going? And then I had a follow-up to Greg. Sure. So the first point is that, we are growing fast then the market, we're taking market share. Over half of our orders last quarter in Q1 were suite orders, effectively we either added on to existing bundles for we -- customers bought more than one. And Jason mentioned two of our larger opportunities, it is bit. The LA Unified School District they bought our CAD and record solution, but not only are we seeing synergies now with our software suite, but one of the key reasons to buy there was location data integration from our LMR side as well. And that had a profound impact in that opportunity.
The City of Phoenix opportunity that Jason mentioned was driven by the national Incident based reporting criteria that the city needed to comply with. And that along with the fact that we are now integrating with the Aware solution for real-time situational awareness, that added a lot of synergy to that opportunity as well. We had our Summits in April and the summit was the largest Software Summit we have ever had in Motorola history. 1,600 attendees, over 300 classes and user group sessions, we had representation across all user types going from call to case closure. There is some important themes that we hit there. The first with the fortification team and really what resonated there was cybersecurity.
We talked about the public safety threat alliance that we launched quite recently and as a consequence of us talking about the public safety threat alliance, within the first two weeks of the creation of it we've had over 50 members sign up to be part of that and we expect that to rapidly increase. We also talked extensively about our innovations in user experience given the theses, given the user that were represented there and some of the -- as an example, some of the AI capabilities that we talked about there really resonated with our customers.
Smart transcription is something that we have talked about previously, but smart transcription has become more than just a transcription -- speech to text transcription, but it really has become and application platform for us that we have built alongside our customers. So not only is transcription a second pair of ears that make sure that the call taker doesn't miss anything. We have now been able to add capabilities where smart transcription allows the call taker to benefit from the experience of other callers who have responded to similar sorts of events.
So, to be able to search for similar calls that they have -- others have responded to and for them to be better informed in responding to new types of event, so smart transcription has actually become an experienced base for existing customers. On top of that, based upon customer feedback we've added capabilities for supervisors to know when to support a call taker during the call as well.
And lastly, we're also extending this to now recognizing when call takers are under stress. So these smart transcription has the capability, it has really expanded our capacity to add applications for our command center software suite. And the last part that I'll mention here is that, mobile has become a significant part of what we have talked about as well. We've invested heavily in mobile CC responder, command center responder has now both in iOS and Android instance supporting our on-prem and our cloud installs, hybrid being a key priority there. And with our customer in Western Australia, we recently launched a CarPlay application that was done in collaboration with Apple and the Western Australia police and this is the very first public safety application to be launched for CarPlay. All of this, by the way very much consistent with our hybrid strategy and we're seeing a fair amount of traction there. That's great. Thanks for that color that. Follow-up for you, Greg. When you step back and kind of look at the world and clearly we are is a surplus demand environment. And at some point supply starts to catch up, but I'm interested in how you think about monitoring the inbound orders and ensuring that customers are running out there and placing a lot of orders, may be with multiple vendors, perhaps ordering more than they need and just kind of taking what comes first. How do you think about that? Obviously, I think it's more PCR related, but just curious, any thoughts you have there? And that’s it from me. Thank you. Ben, I was just going to say the last part that you said. I think it is more PCR related. I think the way we do that is, I think Molloy and John Zidar during this time work really closely with the channel partners, particularly in North America on prioritization, on active conversations, on transparency, on what they really need versus what they may think they want, to try to eliminate any kind of artificial forecasting. So I think it's a reflection of the relationships we have with the channel partners. And I have to tip my hat to John Zidar who runs that organization under Molloy.
I think the way you sort through that is the efficacy and the authenticity of the conversations with the partners during these tough times. And I think Molloy and his team are doing that. Correct. The only thing I'd add to that is, I mean, you're right, the PCR channel -- by the way, it's also important to note that a lot of our partners carry one brand. So they're not putting orders against the second one. The second thing is government customers don't have the wherewithal, meaning, they have a limited budget, they're not able to cut multiple purchase orders against the same budget line item. So we wouldn't have any inflation in orders on there, there is an end customer within, for instance, Cook County. If it's a highway department or the sheriff's department, they've got line item 32, it’s $1 million, they can spend that twice. So we know that there is clarity of funding there. Thanks. Thanks, Ben. Thank you, Ben. The next question is from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. I had two clarifications first, before I can get to my question. What was the FX headwind in the quarter? And also you highlighted, about $170 million in FX headwinds in the revenue, but what's the -- I'm assuming there is a benefit to the OpEx line. So can you maybe tell us what benefit you're seeing on the OpEx from the FX. So the answer to the first question is, within the quarter it was $18 million in FX and on FX in general, we have some offsets within OpEx to mitigate the effects of the gross margin dollars lost. So there is some relief, if you will, on OpEx. But in total, $110 million degradation in -- from last call to this call comes with an OE impact that we are mitigating through price, through cost targets and through allocation to higher mix. Got it. I wanted to ask you on the component shortages, maybe if you can double click on that and maybe provide us a color on what has improved, what has not improved, what gotten worse? Maybe you could give us a bit of clarity on what your line of sight is. You are clearly thinking that things will improve, but can you just give us a color on what portfolio is getting most impacted by component shortages? Yeah. Fahad, I would say as it relates to semiconductor constraints, because that's really what we're referring to. I don't think we see it improving. I think we see it as a constant challenge throughout the remainder of 2022. What improved in Q1 was successfully navigating and negotiating and get some -- getting some increased allocation on some key parts with some key suppliers that moved it from Q2 into Q1. That allowed us to over perform the way we did top and bottom in Q1. I would say that semiconductor constraint environment remains unchanged, i.e., still challenging. We think it will be through the remainder of the year. It is primarily around land mobile radio, but quite frankly video security is not immune completely either, but we are managing those accordingly. Within the LMR portfolio are you seeing more adverse impact on your higher margin PCR and LMR -- APX NEXT portfolio, just kind of color on what within your LMR portfolio is been more adversely impact or what is all universal. I think the, part of the LMR, that's the most challenge with PCR, because we have a lot of common semiconductor parts that go into all types of radios. So we are working closely with customers around favorable mix, in particular, North America and oftentimes higher tier devices that allow us to ship those and fulfill those orders quicker than others. So the main part of the LMR portfolio. I think that feels it the most acutely is probably PCR. The only thing I'd add on the high tier and APX. APX NEXT is the complexity of those products and the joint engineering we do, and the supply lines we have for semiconductors are unique to those products and we're doing a good job in getting the security of that supply lines. So there are some commonalities, but also some uniqueness in our key suppliers and public safety LMR are doing a good job of getting us what we need. I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Thank you. Fahad. Thank you, Fahad. The next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is now open. Greg, Jason, Jack and Mahesh, good afternoon from sunny Chicago. Louie, how you doing? Doing great. Thank you for taking my question. The William Blair team heard very positive commentary about Openpath solutions at the Commercial Real Estate Tech Conference in San Diego. So I was wondering, can you discuss your growth strategy for access control in general? And also I wanted to note that during the quarter it seem that Stanley saw that access technologies division for $900 million and related to your strategy do you expect to be as active with access control and acquisitions as you have been with video acquisitions? Thanks. Okay. Louie, I'll start and Mahesh may want to color in some lines. I think first of all, as it relates to fixed video, security and access control, we've taken a premise and a look at the market to say we want to make sure we meet our customers' for where they are. So it started with Avigilon, which is an on-prem end-to-end solution. We've invested in Avigilon cloud services, but they had a legacy Access Control business as well. Actually that business was actually the highest growth within the Avigilon portfolio one point in time, but we really saw a move to cloud and mobility, particularly as people want -- they want smartphones capability to access a building at 70 [indiscernible]. I would also tell you that Openpath is seen -- it's been -- it outkicked it business case due to the fact that there is a shortage on card readers right now, like a lot of things in the heart. So that's really accelerated the growth into the cloud for Openpath. So I think you will hear a lot of good things.
The other piece with Openpath as I said is its cloud. native, which is different to the most. So we think we've got a pretty good strategy as it relates to both in terms of a buyer wants to cloud solution or Openpath. I mean, now the cloud solution are an on-prem solution. Mahesh, anything you want to add to that. Yeah. I think the Openpath team launched a video intercom reader in Q1 as well and that's sort of is a signal in terms of the convergence between video and access control more broadly. If you look at the architecture of Openpath cloud native with endpoints on friend like readers, but also the ability to tackle existing leaders, support that migration from on-prem to cloud. Ava is a very similar model as well where it can be either entirely cloud native or support a mix in between as well. The combination of Ava and Openpath gives us the opportunity to convert many of the security and access control use cases and expand that ecosystem. So we see a strong solution there that's end to end for security needs. Great. That's perfect. That's it from me. Thanks everyone. Thanks, Louis. Thank you, Louie. The next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Thank you. A question for Greg. Greg, on your prepared comments you mentioned improved funding, is that coming from the stimulus plans or from property taxes? And the reason why I ask is, a lot of property taxes or at least while I am here in Silicon Valley, California they reassessed each year. So people are kind of bracing for a big property tax inflow maybe in six or nine months from -- a big property tax hit in six or 12 months from now. So I would assume that a lot of your budgets are more to stimulus but -- or maybe travel and tourism improving as opposed to real estate property taxes. And if so, does that mean that there is still kind of a second round of improved funding that's coming in. Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Jack. Maybe I'll take that one. So we look at -- if you remember, there's really three primary budgets excluding federal stimulus and those are operating expense budgets that our annualized. So those things pay for things like maintenance, replacement of radios, those kinds of things. That's the first piece of it. The second of which is actually 911 funding. So a lot of the portfolio are command center software budgets, those get set and those monies are allocated in a different way. So it's a different funding stream. The third, as you said, our real estate and property taxes. There is more of an ebb and flow to those things and quite frankly, historically, we don't see a big uptick in those things, because public safety [indiscernible] nice to have, those are prioritized in annual basis and it's really capital or operating expense and it's 911. Now what's really benefited us, as I pointed out earlier and you heard Greg and his prepared remarks is a $350 billion for state and local and $170 billion directed at schools. Those are new funding that's created new opportunities in all aspects of our portfolio. In terms of state and local budget cycles. I'll remind everyone we have thousands of customers in North America. A common changeover in year is around July 1. So they will look at available funds and as well as stimulus and set their priorities. So we'll see what those budgets look like, but all indications are with the backstop of funding that will continue. To get real technical, there is also something -- there is also spot taxes, which are specialized purchase things and they do special taxes and raise money per county wide systems as well, that’s the only kind of one-off. Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. Congratulations.
Thank you, Jim. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Yeah. I just want to close -- Thank you for that opportunity. I want to close by thanking all of the Motorola Solutions people around the world for their commitment, perseverance in what was a strong Q1. Despite the fluid and dynamic environment demand, it just remains exceptionally strong. The customer funding environment remains robust. We continue to make investments in software and video. And as Jason and others outlined in this call, we continue to take action to offset higher costs.
I would just say this, macroeconomic turbulence and uncertainty presents opportunity and we will continue to deploy capital against the backdrop of those opportunities that present themselves. Thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again in a few months. And again to all the Motorola people, thank you, thank you, thank you. Much appreciated. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately two hours.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. The presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website.
In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2022 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
I'll turn the call over to Greg. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through the results and our outlook.
First, Q2 was exceptional across the board with revenue and earnings per share both coming in above our expectations. In Software and Services, revenue was up 11%, highlighted by strong software growth. And in Products and SI, continued record demand across both land mobile radio and video, led to 7% revenue growth and 17% orders growth, driving increased backlog.
Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable currency impact. Second, our portfolio and go-to-market investments are continuing to drive meaningful growth across all 3 technologies. During the quarter, revenue was up 21% in both video and command Center Software, and we saw record Q2 orders in both of those technologies as well. And in LMR, demand is growing for our high Tier P25 APX NEXT device with customers embracing its unique ability to offer the must-have reliability of LMR while seamlessly leveraging broadband features such as remote programming, network extension and location services.
And finally, based on our Q2 record ending backlog and continued strong operational execution, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Jason, who will take you through our results and outlook and then return for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter was up 9% and above our guidance with record second quarter revenue in both segments. We saw strong growth across all 3 technologies, led by over 20% growth in both Video and Command Center Software. In LMR, which grew 5%, we were able to secure more critical parts, particularly later in the quarter, which enabled us to ship more product.
Acquisitions during the quarter added $34 million and FX headwinds were $44 million. GAAP operating earnings were $358 million, and operating margins were 16.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $497 million, up $15 million or 3% from the year ago quarter, and non-GAAP operating margins were 23.2%, down from 24.4%. The decline in operating margins was due to the higher semiconductor costs we outlined on our prior calls related to acquiring critical supply in the secondary market, together with higher freight costs and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.
GAAP earnings per share was $1.33 compared to $1.69 per share in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized in the prior year and higher direct material costs in the current year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.07, flat versus last year. The higher sales and operating earnings generated in the current quarter were offset by the higher direct material costs I mentioned previously, along with higher operating expenses related to acquisitions.
OpEx in Q2 was $502 million, up $25 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $10 million compared with $388 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was a usage of $49 million compared to $326 million generated in the prior year. In Q2 and the first half of the year, our cash flow has been primarily impacted by 2 items: first, our planned investments in inventory to navigate the dynamic supply chain environment and position us to fulfill the record demand we're seeing in Video and LMR; second, higher employee incentive payments that were tied to 2021's performance and paid out this year.
We expect our cash flow conversion to accelerate in the second half, driven by higher profitability and a reduction in our current inventory levels in addition to the normal seasonality of our cash conversion. Capital allocation for Q2 included $162 million in share repurchases, $132 million in cash dividends and $59 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the video acquisitions of Calipsa for $40 million and Videotec for $22 million. We also issued $600 million of long-term debt, used a portion of the proceeds to retire $275 million, resulting in approximately $320 million of incremental debt net of fees on our balance sheet.
In the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter were up 7% versus last year and orders were up 17%, including record Q2 orders for both LMR and video. Revenue from acquisitions for this segment in the quarter was $14 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Operating earnings for Products and SI were $188 million or 14.6%, down from 16.2% of sales in the prior year, driven primarily by the higher material costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.
We continue to expect full year operating margins for this segment to be slightly higher than 2021 as the impact from pricing actions accelerates in the second half. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment include several large P25 orders in the U.S., including $32 million for a state of California agency, $27 million for Dutchess County, New York and $22 million order for the Georgia Department of Corrections. We also had a $26 million order for a P25 solution with LTE integration for an international customer, a $15 million TETRA order for a customer in Argentina. And finally, we received 2 large fixed video orders, a $9 million order for a customer in the health care vertical and an $8 million order for a large retail customer.
In the Software and Services segment, revenue was up 11%, with revenue from acquisitions of $20 million and currency headwinds of $25 million during the quarter. Total software revenue was up 25%, driven by strong demand in video and a large deployment in Command Center Software, while in LMR services, revenue was up 5%. Operating earnings in the segment were $309 million or 36.1% of sales, down 110 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A expenses, partially offset by higher sales.
We continue to expect segment operating margins for Software and Services for the full year to be comparable to last year, inclusive of the additional OpEx spend from our recent acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include 2 large multiyear LMR service renewals, $43 million with the state of South Australia and $35 million with the state of Mississippi. We also had 3 large Command Center Softwares in the U.S. -- orders in the U.S., $35 million from a large metropolitan city, $14 million from the Los Angeles Police Department and $11 million from Frederick County, Maryland. We were also awarded an $8 million body-worn camera order from the Detroit Police Department.
Moving next to our regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 13% on growth in all 3 technologies. International Q2 revenue was $656 million, flat versus last year, with growth in all 3 technologies, offset by unfavorable FX.
Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record -- Q2 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.2 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable FX. The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of '21 and increased demand across all 3 technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $21 million, driven primarily by a $397 million movement in unfavorable FX and the quarterly revenue burn related to the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record Q2 orders in LMR products, video and Command Center Software.
In the Products and SI segment, continued robust order demand in both LMR and Video is driving record backlog, which was up $986 million or 30% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $206 million, which was our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in the products segment. Additionally, our product backlog increasingly reflects new pricing, which we expect to contribute to the profitability ramp for the second half.
In Software and Services, backlog was $1.2 billion compared to last year, driven also by the Airwave extension and a $380 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially, backlog was down $227 million or 2%, driven primarily by unfavorable FX and revenue recognition for the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record second quarter orders in Command Center Software.
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 10%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.85 and $2.90 per share. This assumes approximately $60 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.03 and $10.13 per share up from our prior guide of $9.80 to $9.95 per share. This updated guidance includes FX headwinds of approximately $170 million, a diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5%.
Before I turn the call back to Greg, I would like to highlight some of the priorities we are driving for the remainder of the year. First, we remain focused on supply chain execution, both tactically and strategically, including rapid redesigns by our engineering teams to substitute to available semiconductors, alternatives, strategic inventory investments that we are making, securing high-demand discrete semiconductors from brokers when necessary and entering into long-term supply agreements where possible.
Second, our pricing actions across the portfolio have been effective to date, and we'll continue to look at pricing opportunities and maintain cost discipline as we manage through a higher cost environment. And finally, we are balancing the benefits of higher inventory with cash conversion, and we'll continue to optimize our working capital and balance sheet to drive increased cash flow in the second half.
I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Jason, thanks. I'd like to end with a few thoughts as we conclude this call. First, I'm really pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We achieved Q2 record sales, including 21% growth in both video and Command Center Software. We strengthened our video portfolio with the acquisitions of Calipsa, which brings us advanced cloud native video analytics, and Videotec, which broadens our ruggedized camera portfolio to serve the critical infrastructure market.
We had record Q2 product orders at higher prices, including our single largest quarter ever for PCR orders, and we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog. The pricing actions we've taken to offset higher input costs position us well for margin expansion for the back half of this year.
Second, our investments in AI and cloud continue to drive robust software growth for the company. Customers like Greenville County schools in South Carolina depend on our video security and access control solution to help keep students safe. And the city of Houston is deploying more than 3,000 body-worn cameras with cloud-based evidence management to help provide greater accountability and transparency.
And with the acquisitions such as AVA Security and Calipsa, we're well positioned to accelerate the deployment of cloud video software solutions with customers around the world. And finally, as we enter the second half of this year, I am very encouraged by our momentum. The multiyear funding environment for our customers continues to be as strong as it's ever been, our solutions for both public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. Our strong execution has allowed us to effectively navigate this dynamic environment.
And finally, the resilience of our business, our durable cash flows and our strong balance sheet provide us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our future deployment of capital.
And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions. Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask the question. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from George Notter of Jefferies. Congratulations on the strong results and backlog. I guess I wanted to ask about a comment you made about the funding environment. What's your perspective now on state and local government budgets? Obviously, many of those budgets began on July 1. Many of those budgets were reset looking forward. Just be curious on what your perspective is on the funding environment and how you're seeing those budgets?
And then also related to that is a question of ARPA. I'm wondering if you're seeing ARPA money right now. I think last quarter, you told us you were seeing a 3x improvement in the sales funnel. What does that look like right now? Any more detail you can provide would be great? Sure, George. So when you think about state and local budgets, I mean, I think, first of all, we hear us say it time and time again, what we do, what we provide is a need to have, not a nice to have. But as it relates to the inflationary environment we're dealing in, self-funding alone for states, they're in a very beneficial period of time. Because if you look at it, they derive their budgets from personal income tax, from sales tax and from corporate income tax, all of which stand the benefit to drive more money into their coffers and thereby, improve their general fund situation.
So it's that piece of it. We also look at the second rail of this, and that's the monies that are being made available through ARPA. And I would just simply say that we've talked about it, it's generally beneficial, and we think it's a general tailwind. But the most important thing is it's not a 2022 phenomenon. It's one that's multiyear.
And in fact, these won't expire until 2024, and all likelihood we know is those will likely be extended. So you've heard Greg said it. I think he said in the script, but we're in a really unique situation because we are in a good funding environment. But I think it also is timely because we're going through product refresh investments. We're seeing that here in the United States with the APX NEXT platform. And later this year, we're going to be announcing the mid-tier APX NEXT devices, which we're really excited about. The next question comes from Erik Lapinski of Morgan Stanley. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just following up on the comment you just made on kind of LMR and the APX NEXT. Can you give us any update on just with some of the P25 deals you're seeing? What the uptake is of APX NEXT and some of those upgrades? Is it skewing towards being most? Or I guess, just legs on that cycle and how we should think about that? Yes. So as I've said before, we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle. I used the baseball metaphor. And our -- I believe it was our February call in second inning, I think we're largely still in that period of time. But just a couple of updates, $190 million of orders. Interestingly, we're seeing a lot of interest from non-Motorola customers, and it's not only the better basics, the ergonomics and the audio performance of the APX NEXT, but it's really the Smart Connect.
And so what our customers saw during COVID, particularly people like health departments, was the capability to expand their coverage outside of the P25 networks. It's also things like smart mapping. We think about accountability, we think about officer and firefighter safety, location is paramount to that. And then we're also looking at messaging as we have more and more young officers in the field, they need ways, different modalities like text and video and the capability to share those. That type of data and they're using the LTE collaborative aspect of the APX NEXT.
So again, really excited. But I would note that we've -- the $190 million has all been targeted at the highest tier, which is the original APX NEXT with subsequent releases in the second half of this year with the mid-tier portfolio, which we're starting to engage in customer discussions on. And Erik, the $190 million of orders is since the APX NEXT product was introduced, but I'd also add that just, in general, Q2 was a record for P25 public safety devices, which is more broad than APX NEXT as well. So APX NEXT continues to fire away. And just to -- I think the team did a superb job in product introduction. Molloy's team has sold it, but also more broadly beyond APX NEXT, Q2 was a record for 25 public safety orders, which I'm quite happy about as well. Awesome. If I could sneak in another one just on Command Center Software. You had a few larger deals there to this quarter. Just in terms of progress and maybe uptake of some of the cloud-based offerings you have there, were any of those upgrades more on cloud-based? And then did any maybe expand beyond the PSAP presence you have into other capabilities? Yes. So maybe just a quick overview. Jason mentioned 2 specific deals, LVMPD, Frederick County. If you look at both of those, LVMPD was on-premises records deal, but really a hybrid element to it, and that was the CommandCentral Responder piece, which is really driven by mobile access to records information. We're seeing more and more of that, and that hybrid element was key to that particular deal.
With Frederick, we added CommandCentral Aware in addition to PremierOne CAD. Aware is a cloud hosted a SaaS solution for us. And Aware gives the county a single plane of glass to understand where unit locations are, both from radios and also from incident information. It is as Jack said previously location information being paramount -- accurate location information being paramount in that case. We continue to invest in our hybrid strategy. We're executing on our hybrid strategy.
And a key point there is that our SaaS growth rate is actually faster than the overall Command Center Software growth rate, which itself was quite strong in this quarter. And the last thing that I'll say is we're continuing to innovate and invest in innovations. And we had 2 significant firsts this quarter. One is, we introduced the world's first public safety Carplay application, one that we developed with Western Australia Police and with Apple. And the second is along with Prince Georges County in Maryland, we won the Thomas O'Reilly Innovation Award for being the first in the country to introduce location-based routing -- NENA i3 compliant location-based routing. So together, I think we are executing well on our hybrid strategy. The next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. I just wanted to ask about them between calls, so hopefully it hasn't been asked. But Greg, could you maybe give us any updates on ESN and Airwave? In particular, if you could review any financial implications? I think there's significant differences in the different outcomes and probabilities based on what happens and just that might make sense to level set with investors? Yes. I think things remain engaged and in progress, Adam, really. We are in close contact with the customer, in this case, the U.K. home office. We've maintained very close contact with the CMA and have regularly provided them with information over the last several weeks and months as we educate them on our role in both Airwave and ESN. As you've seen, the time line has been updated by the CMA panel, and they now expect a provisional decision in September with a final decision in December. And there's really not much more I can add at this point because I just don't know. I think it will play out in the back half of the year, but I think the engagement has been quite strong. And in the meantime, we continue to invest both in Airwave actively and providing that mission-critical service as well as ESN. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up. It looked like at a glance backlog trends remain very, very healthy. What does this say about elasticity in core products? I know you've been implementing some price increases understandably as your costs have increased. If you can maybe recap some of the price increases and talk about the elasticity that you're seeing given backlog trends, that would be helpful? Sure. So when I think about the first half growth for the company, which is about 8%, the price contributions on the actions that Jack's sales team have implemented was less than half of the contributor to growth. And with the actions that Jack can describe, we will continue to do, we think it will be even more of an opportunity in the second half as most of the orders that come to us in the second half were not -- from a more recent backlog as opposed to aged pricing. No, I think you're right. And the other piece of that is just -- it's one thing to raise the price. And I think one of the things that our team has done a really nice job at is actually discount management. And so an example, we've raised prices in all 3 sleeves, all 3 technology groups, but also we've ushered in price increases in our services business as well. And we're seeing net retention increases there as well. So we're really proud and pleased with the services team on that aspect as well. The next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Congratulations on a great quarter. I guess I just want to follow up on the supply chain. Much has been talked about the semiconductors and the $120 million will be spent through the end of the year. But can you talk about are there any other issues that have kind of popped up? Or are you guys looking to enter into 2023 is like a clean slate as you sit now? Keith, $120 million you mentioned, which was our year-over-year expected increase largely for finding the semiconductor supply. We remain on target for that. It was a little higher than $100 million in the first half and might be a little higher than the $20 million in the second half. But as you know, with our increased guide, that's supporting a higher volume. So we're pleased with the allocation of that budget, if you will, to find semiconductors, which sometimes come into premium, I should note that that's not our primary method.
Our primary method is the rapid redesigns that our engineering teams are doing, and they're finding available alternatives if the part is constrained. And they're doing an amazing job there. We'll continue to look at that inventory investments and long-term supply agreements. So generally, it remains -- semiconductor is our largest-gated item, particularly in LMR. Great. Appreciate it. This is a follow-up. In terms of the backlog, backlog has been record numbers for a while now, and this is impressive growth. But are we looking at an apples-to-apples comparison? Or is the backlog getting older in terms of the contracts that you're entering into are getting longer? Is there an apple-to-apples comparison we need to go through? The duration of the backlog, if that's what you're getting at, Keith, is largely consistent with where we've been over time. if anything, the products backlog, which we continue to print sequential increases in, tends to be, as you know, a more quicker turning than the associated software and services. So we're pleased with the backlog growth in both segments. And it continues -- product's backlog increases continues even with some price increases that customers are accepting and value our products. Next question comes from Fahad Najam of Loop Capital. Greg, in the 8 years that I've been listening to you on the earnings call, I think I was -- I feel like you sounded the most confident and positive that I've ever heard us. So am I correct in my understanding? And if it is, can you just walk me through what is driving your confidence and your positive look in terms of your top drivers? Yes, Fahad, thanks for the question. I'm smiling because -- and we were talking about it, we have been talking about it. The fact of the matter is this is as good in an environment as I've seen. And I don't mean that just externally, as Jack and Jason have talked about multiyear funding here, particularly in North America, for state and local customers and at the federal level, but it's the position of the firm overall.
Demand is extremely high for public safety and enterprise security. We also see, at the same time, concerns, which I think are legitimate around deploying Chinese equipment in critical infrastructure or highly confidential or secure areas. Backlog is at record levels. Product backlog, as we talked about in Q2. Orders were 17% against the revenue print of 7%. So we're building it.
Jason just mentioned that the backlog comparison is largely apples-to-apples. We're performing and raising the full year from approximately 7% to 8% against continued FX headwinds. We're managing difficult semiconductor supply chain environment. And while it's very modestly better, I think the tip of the hat goes to the supply chain, financial and operational teams here at Motorola that are learning to do product redesign and manage inventory in a way that's constructive and productive to meet demand.
I love the deployment of capital that we've done. Organically, where Jack and Mahesh continue to emphasize innovation and move things to the cloud and do product refresh on devices. We've made, I think, pretty thoughtful and accretive and strategically important acquisitions, and our addressable market continues to grow as well. So when I look at execution, when I look at demand, when I look at R&D, when I look at innovation, when I look at multiyear funding, when I look at the overall factors that I think contribute enable and facilitate demand for our product, it's quite strong.
And as a final note, the ability for us to demonstrate multiple price increases and still grow backlog and still drive robust revenue growth speaks to the criticality of what we do and the ability for our customers to absorb that and our ability to pass on higher input costs. So it is a very good environment. It's why we beat both top and bottom in Q2, why we're raising the full year and why I feel very good about the momentum in the back half. That's really insightful. So how does that translate into your model? Because last time when you gave up your long-term model, it was 9%, 10%. Clearly, you're exceeding that now. So what are you thinking about your new model? No, I -- we were talking about that. I gave 9% and 10% in 2021, obviously, because I believed in it, we had COVID. COVID delayed things for a year, but here we are. We're not going to talk about any long-term model, Fahad, at this point, but we still believe that the product segment will grow mid-single digits, although our increase for the year from 7% to 8% is largely LMR and video. So actually, that increase from a segment standpoint is primarily in the product.
So it's maybe mid-single digits, nudging slightly higher. We still believe Software and Services will be approximately 10%. We agree with the -- we still are maintaining the guidance on the 3 technologies: LMR, mid-single digits; video security, approximately 20%; Command Center Software, low double digits as we continue to contribute to backlog and we like the momentum in the back half, I think it positions us well as we head into 2023. As we print more of the year and get more execution behind us, we'll update you accordingly on future thoughts for 2023 and beyond. The next question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. First, congrats on the quarter. I'm not sure many people are actually expecting an increase on the top line. But presenting the question that I had for you guys is, I wanted to know within products and systems integration. If we were just to look at radios and radio handsets, have you been prioritizing LMR public safety over PCR? Have you managed to ship and prioritize both essentially at the same level, right? Trying to get an idea on just mix. And then maybe just a clarification. Did you say that PCR is growing mid-single digits to slightly better in 2022? Or if you didn't actually clarify that, maybe you could just clarify it now? Yes, Sami, I'll take the second one first. The product segment color is to continue to grow Product and SI at mid-single digit, maybe a little bit higher than that because the flow-through is in that segment. For PCR, last quarter, we said it would grow mid-single digit. We now expect it to grow at 10% or even slightly higher for the full year, given the strong performance in Q2 that will flow through in the back half. And Sami, to answer your question on prioritization and balance, we continue to be focused on public safety. Q1, we have prioritized public safety. In Q2, with some of the breakthroughs the team was able to make around supply, we were able to fulfill more demand for PCR in Q2 and grew at double digits. So in Q2, given the supply environment, we were able to fulfill both public safety and PCR. Got it. And then I was hoping we could hear from Jack a little bit on body-worn camera and dash cam regarding license plate reading and some of the other kind of features that you guys have released. Can you give us an update on market share momentum? What's really going on from that side? Sure, Sami. So as it relates to Q2, our orders were up 13%. I think when you can textualize that over the fact that 13% over the previous quarter, that was up 80%, 8-0 percent, the previous year. We think we had a relatively strong order. You heard Jason reference the Detroit PD win. And I think that's a test point to what we've been saying is that the market wants an alternative.
I think the other piece of it is we're starting to see, late last year, we came out with as a service offer, and we're seeing an acceleration in our customers wanting to choose cloud. We've said before and I said at the end of 2021, we doubled our orders. We knew the market didn't grow that fast. We knew we took share in 2021.
I'd simply say for the first half of this year, given our performance kind of in the mid-teens growth over 68% and 80% orders growth comps, we think we're performing relatively well. And as I said, we think we're a very viable alternative in the marketplace right now. I have one quick one for Jason. Sorry, go ahead. Just on the technology investments side that you also asked about, we continue to invest in a closer integration between our body-warn cameras and our radios as well, specifically with APX and APX NEXT devices. So for example, if you press the emergency button on an APX or an APX NEXT radio, it turns on recording as an option as well. And there are more features there to come as well.
This quarter, we also released live streaming capability going from the V300s and our in-car video solution to Aware. And Aware also integrates real-time location information from our APX and APX NEXT radios. So location information coming from both body-worn cameras and our radios together gives accurate information, again, location being a key necessity for our customers.
And lastly, we also introduced new advanced AI-driven reduction capability to CommandCentral evidence, which is a key capability that our customers have been asking for. And I think we're very proud of what we were able to put in.
Q2 also was our first shipping quarter for our M500 solution. The M500 started shipping in February of this year. We have seen great growth in the M500.
And just as a reminder, we released the M500 with 2 key AI capabilities, ALPR being one of them, and backseat passenger analytics being the second. This is a true AI platform, the M500 is, and we're going to be introducing more capabilities we have firmware upgrade into that platform as well. We think there's great potential there. Jason, one quick one on your FX guidance -- your FX headwind guidance for the year. Is that including international currencies improve relative to the U.S. dollar? Or does that assume everything equal from this point forward on FX rates? Current spot rates going forward relative to last year. So the $170 million of headwinds on the year is about consistent with where it was the last quarter we were together. It's certainly been volatile. But today, it's at approximately $170 million of top line degradation related to FX this year. Next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. One clarification. What was the level of PCR in the quarter? And can you remind us -- I think it peaked out at $1 billion before the pandemic hit. But can you remind us of where you're at in the recovery of that business? For Q2, Paul, PCR revenue growth was 15%. And it's base last year, Paul, was $800-and-something million. And so it's on -- as we told you earlier, 10%, maybe slightly higher this year, which will put it still short of the 2019 reference point you just made. All right. So the real question is -- I'm sorry, go ahead. Paul, I was just going to add one other point is that Q2 was a record orders quarter for PCR as well. Exactly. Okay. And notwithstanding the macro, obviously, it sounds like the business has been given all the different variables that seem to be so positive, where is the greatest opportunity for greatest improvement from here going forward over the next 12 to 36 months? And in connection with that, I saw was not able to pay you cash in respect of the litigation. Where does that -- are they being effectively shut out of the market? Where does that go from here? And finally, where is video penetration and in the public sector? Well, let's start with Hytera. I'm kind of not surprised that they missed the deadline, the court order deadline to pay cash into escrow by July 31. They've had a pattern of denied, deflect, distract and no action. They owe us about $680 million all in. By the way, the guidance and color we give you on the full year of 2022 and cash and cash flow assume nothing from Hytera.
We filed a motion this morning that they are in contempt of court. And we'll see what the judge rules and remedies -- further remedies that they apply, but I can't say I'm particularly surprised. Paul, I think you had a question as well on video, and I would just simply say that, our video and access control business is growing approximately 20% this year in 2022. We continue to invest in the portfolio extensively, both by way of our edge devices or camera. But also in the -- on our software and analytics side of the things, cloud and mobile become increasingly important when you think about our 3 big acquisitions: Openpath, who has fundamentally changed the game for us in the access control market; Ava and Calipsa as well.
The AI that Calipsa bring and its ability to proliferate into our Pelco camera line is also a game changer. And I think you asked a question about verticals. But when we think about our top verticals, it's really government, education, health care and commercial. If you remember, when we acquired Avigilon in February of 2018, their government business was nascent. And now it's one of our top ones. And we think that's the benefit of the scale and the revenue synergies that our sales force around the globe has been able to bring. Okay. The real question was, I assume it's still preciously early in the government, public sector in terms of video penetration. Yes. So I think we talked about, first of all, just a baseline and government, it's early days. But to eventualize that business, it's approximately $430 million is our expectation this year. Think of that as 2/3 mobile video, 1/3 fixed video. Next question comes from Louie DiPalma of William Blair. Greg, on previous calls, you referenced how you are seeing robust demand from the education vertical. Is demand from education customers for your artificial intelligence solutions getting even stronger with this exceptionally strong guidance for this upcoming school year following several different security incidents nationwide? Yes, Louie, Education has been a very key vertical, along with government for fixed video and access control. It has been and continues to be because of what you referenced the need for video security, perimeter detection, anomaly detection, access control, automation alerts. And I think that the demand for that broad portfolio continues to be strong and maybe perhaps is even getting stronger. And I don't know if Jack or Mahesh want to complement on that as well. Greg, I think you hit it. The other one is we made a significant investment to evolve technologies. And I would say stadiums and schools are the big driver for concealed weapons detection. We know the horrific things that happened at Uvalde just earlier in the summer. And I think that's driving a converged experience to make sure that they've got the video and access control, but they also have a way to temper and test for weapons as they approach campus as well. The other point I'd make is that our Q2 results and our increased guide for the year were driven largely by our expectations for LMR, which is about 2/3 of the increase in video and then the other 1/3, both of which are serving education and many other verticals. And for Jack, these past 2 quarters, it appears that you won your 2 largest Command Center Software orders in company history. And I think you mentioned in a prior answer that you are seeing traction with hybrid deployments on-premise and the cloud. Were any of your recent orders for your next-gen 911 solution and your 911 call taking and CAD solution in the cloud? Or are these more for your traditional modules that you're seeing the success? This is Mahesh. I'd say that there's still stronger demand for the on-premises solution for 911 and CAD. Availability and reliability being some key factors that are involved there. That said, our call handling solutions combined with our heavy investment in smart transcription, which is a cloud-hosted AI solution; Citizen Input, which is also a cloud-hosted way of allowing citizens to have over-the-top video input and text input into PSAP as well for call handling, we're seeing significant traction in that space.
On CAD, hybrid capabilities become very important. We are seeing Aware -- CommandCentral Aware frequently attached with our CAD sales. And the other thing is emphasis on mobile. For LAPD, I mentioned CommandCentral Responder. The need for smartphone access to information in the field is becoming more and more important. And CommandCentral Responder, along with its many capabilities, really complements both our on-premise CAD and record solutions as well. So we see that hybrid really driving adoption for the key features that are best delivered in the cloud, along with the high available solutions that our 911 and CAD customers want. The next question comes from Paul Chung of JPMorgan. So just on the guide, how do we think about kind of the gross margin ramp in the second half? Do you still expect to be kind of flat for the year? And then same kind of question on OpEx. I may have missed it, but still up kind of $100 million for the year. And then as we think about '23, how much of kind of the gross margin pressure this year do you see as somewhat temporary in your expectations of how those margins rebound and particularly in the first half? You also have some benefits from price increases as well and how that kind of factors in? Just your early thoughts on '23. Well, I'll start with the biggest driver of our gross margin trend this year is the higher semiconductor costs year-over-year. We had planned for about $100 million of year-over-year increase, which you're seeing in the P&L through the first half. It was actually a little higher than that. And we had planned for $20 million of incremental year-over-year cost for semiconductors in the second half, it will probably be slightly higher than that, given the higher volumes that we just guided to.
So those items, again, are related to us paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available from primary sources. So as the semiconductor market stabilizes, normalizes, there's opportunity on that as we continue to get more and more supply into the future directly from the manufacturers, which is something we're working on.
In terms of gross margin trend, for the year, yes. The second half will be certainly better, and we'll get to approximately similar and OE slightly up for the year, which will cover the $100 million of OpEx, you're right, of increase that we're expecting for the year-over-year, $75 million of which from the OpEx side is related to M&A. So that's how to think about it from a P&L perspective. Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on video. You're seeing some relative strength in the Software and Services for quite some time. So talk about the demand trends and specific solutions you're kind of most excited about? And how do we think about that relative pace as we look further out? Yes. Paul, I think so we've talked about we expect 20% for fixed video and really for the video segment as well, approximately 20% for the full year. We've dimensionalized some of the verticals. We're having some success. I think it's a story about cloud, mobile analytics.
The other piece of it that we probably didn't talk are some of the vertical specific things that we're doing. We acquired a company called Envision. That gives us a space into quick-service retail. And investments like that as well as cloud put us on a path where we're starting to build a recurring revenue business within our video security segment as well, which is exciting. The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Congratulations to you and your team. Greg, when we think about strategy, and you mentioned you had your biggest LMR contract ever, which is great. Are you now at a point where the majority of your new wins are including multiple cross-sell Motorola Solutions, product solutions, services, command centers and things like that? Or are we still at the very early part of not much is be connected? That was kind of my strategy question.
Then for finance -- Chief Financial Officer question. Did you say how much impacted gross margins decommits or go into a broker market was for components? And I assume when you get these big contracts, you're securing the parts right away, so you don't have future price escalation as chip companies have increased pricing? Well, on the first part, Jim, I think we're in the early innings overall. I mean you take a step back and think about this firm and our addressable market now given the industries we play in and the acquisitions we've made, it's just under $50 billion. And the guidance this year for full year informs approximately 9%. So there's a lot of room to run here.
While we are growing fixed video and access control at 20%, we are not the leader yet, either globally or in North America. And I think there's every opportunity for us to continue to take share and make up ground given the width and breadth of the portfolio, which I believe from an industry standpoint is unmatched. Our ability to play in fixed video and mobile video, layer on analytics, license plate recognition and all the things that Mahesh and the technical team are doing an artificial intelligence.
On LMR, the installed base gets larger. You think about roughly 13,000 different LMR networks, by which we fill the footprint of infrastructure, sell devices, monetize services, upsell, refresh the device portfolio, integrate LTE into LMR for network extension and software over-the-air reprogramming and location services. And then all the things Mahesh is doing in Command Center Software, which is premises-based, cloud-based, hybrid and the overall backdrop of more and more criticality around public safety, enterprise security and not having key China vendors in any of that critical infrastructure, I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us. The only thing I'd add, Greg, is I think, Jim, I think I heard you ask a question on cross-sell. It's very important. We've attacked that by way of sales specific incentives around Command Center Software around fixed and mobile video as well. Our North America sales leader, Jim, here is, has come up with -- first of all, we have a tool, a 3-dimensional tool by account that gives us kind of the lay of the land where we're doing well and where we're not and where we should focus our time. And we've inserted a sales around specific technology escalators. And that, I think, served us fairly well. And Jim, to answer your question on securing semiconductor components, we're doing so in many different ways, directly from the manufacturer through us and purchase orders all the way through long-term supply agreements. And then finally, brokers when necessary, and therefore, have a constant flow of parts. I think it's important to note that Motorola and our engineering abilities, over 40% of our company are engineers. And we continually give them challenges, including if a part we know to be in constraint, they are helping find alternatives. And that alternative, then the supply chain organization can go out and procure. So it's a constant battle, and we're proud of the way the teams are collaborating and working through the environment. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional comments or closing remarks. Yes. Thank you, everybody. Most especially, thank you for all the Motorolans on the call and listening. Exceptional performance, couldn't be more proud of you. I'm proud of this company, proud of you and proud of the purpose that we serve. I think -- look, I think these results amplify and reinforce the criticality of public safety and enterprise security and the fact that in this environment, quite frankly, it's never been more important.
I want to add to something Jason just said and tip my hat to everybody involved on supply chain execution and navigating this very dynamic environment. I do think part of the overperformance in Q2 and what we're passing on for the full year is strong execution in supply chain. I think it's largely done by the engineers that Jason referenced and others on product redesign, surgical acquisition of inventory, appropriate purchases in the open market for broker parts and a modestly slightly better environment in Q2.
But the supply chain, specifically semiconductor environment remains challenging. Having said all that, there's more work to be done, but I do like our position and I like our momentum for the second half. We have to continue to execute.
I appreciate you listening, and I look forward to talking to you and joining you in a few months. Thanks, everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within two hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.
All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]
I will now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2022 third quarter earnings call. With me today or Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President, CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary; and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. Statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factor section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K or any other quarterly report on Form-10Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thank you, Tim. And good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. First, our Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand and robust funding environment that we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, EPS 28%, and expanded operating margins by 220 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q3 ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19% from last year, inclusive of over $800 million of unfavorable currency impact.
Second, we achieved record Q3 revenue in both segments in Products and Systems Integration, increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies and continued solid execution in our supply chain led to revenue growth of 15% during the quarter. And in Software and Services revenue was up 8% and 13% when normalized for FX.
And finally, based on our exceptionally strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS for the second consecutive time, despite full year FX headwinds that now total about $220 million up $50 million from our expectations last quarter.
So at this point, I will now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 13% and was above our guidance with record third quarter revenue in both segments. We also saw growth across all three technologies led by 33% growth in video security and access control.
In LMR, which grew 9%, our supply chain execution during the quarter enabled us to ship additional product revenue. FX headwinds during the quarter were $66 million, while acquisitions added $32 million.
GAAP operating earnings were $373 million inclusive of $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment charge recognized during the quarter related to the now planned exit from the ESN contract. GAAP operating margins were 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $676 million, up 22% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%, up from 26.3%. This increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, and improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment.
GAAP earnings per share were a $1.63 compared to a $1.76 per share in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the impairment charge related to the expected early exit of the ESN contract.
Non-GAAP EPS was $3 per share, up 28% from $2.35 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales in margins, as well as a lower affected tax rate related to higher benefits from stock comp recognized in the current year.
OpEx in Q3 was $521 million up $25 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow Q3 operating cash flow was $388 million, up $12 million compared with the prior year. And free cash flow was $318 million up $3 million. For the full year we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $100 million lower than our prior guidance, primarily due to our continued investment in inventory, which is helping us execute in a dynamic supply chain environment and deliver against the continued record demand we're seeing in video security and LMR.
Capital allocation for Q3 included $132 million in cash dividends, $94 million in share repurchases and $70 million of CapEx.
Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Barrett Communications, a specialty supplier of high frequency and tactical communications equipment for $18 million net of cash.
Moving to segment results in the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter, were up 15% versus last year and orders were up 29%, including record Q3 orders for both LMR and video.
Currency headwinds were $28 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter contributed $13 million.
Operating earnings were $375 million or 24.5% of sales up from 20.6% in the prior year, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. The impact from our pricing actions increased in Q3 as expected, and we continue to expect full year operating margins in this segment to be higher than last year.
Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include an order in Israel valued at over $400 million for a duration of 25 years. This unique system integration project also includes over $30 million of fixed video equipment and software, and is our single largest order ever for Avigilon.
$165 million P25 System and APX NEXT devices award received from Miami-Dade County that includes a new customer for us in the state of Florida; a $67 million P25 order from Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority; a $45 million P25 order from a customer in Africa; a $29 million P25 devices order from a U.S. federal customer, an $18 million TETRA order from a customer in Europe, and a $5 million fixed video order from a major transportation company in North Africa.
In Software and Services revenue was up 8%, which includes $38 million of FX headwinds and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% driven by strong demand in video, while in LMR services revenue was up 4% after $33 million of FX headwinds. Operating earnings in the segment were $301 million or 35.7% of sales, down 30 basis points from last year driven by higher acquisition expenses.
Some notable Q3 highlights in the segment include two large multi-year LMR service renewals, a $43 million won with the State of Maryland and $15 million with the City of Phoenix. Also, a $17 million push-to-talk over broadband order from a customer in the Middle East, a $7 million command center software renewal with Will County, Illinois, a $4 million body-worn camera order for the Texas Department of Public Safety, and a $4 million command center software suite order for Ellis County, Texas.
Looking at regional results, North America Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 16% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $686 million, up 4% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX.
Moving to our backlog, ending backlog was a Q3 record of $13.5 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $826 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million orders reduction related to the planned exit from the ESN contract.
The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021, and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was up $87 million driven by several large orders received during the quarter, partially offset by $411 million of unfavorable FX and the $99 million adjustment for ESN.
In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $1.2 billion or 35% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $513 million, which was our ninth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment.
In Software and Services backlog was up $876 million compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $288 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts in North America, partially offset by $722 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to ESN. So sequentially backlog was down $426 million or 5% driven primarily by unfavorable FX, the ESN adjustment and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter.
Turning now to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 9% with non-GAAP earnings per share, between $3.40 and $3.45 per share. This assumes $90 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.
For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance again. We now expect revenue growth between 9.25% and 9.5% up from our prior guidance of 8%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.17 and $10.22 per share, up from our prior guidance of $10.03 to $10.13 per share. This updated guidance now includes full year FX headwinds of $220 million, up $50 million from our prior guidance, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This now also assumes $150 million of higher costs for the full year related to the procurement of semiconductors from secondary markets at a premium. This is a $30 million increase over what we indicated earlier in the year and supports the increased revenue included in our updated guidance today.
And finally, as I reflect on where we stand today with just two months left in another dynamic year, I'm encouraged with how our teams have been navigating the supply chain environment and overcoming the impact of a historically strong U.S. dollar. At the beginning of the year, we expected currency headwinds to have a $60 million translation impact on our full year revenues. The full year FX headwind has increased by $160 million since then. The decisions we've made to carry higher inventory pay premiums for semiconductors and the pricing actions we implemented have enabled us to drive higher product revenues that not only offset these significant FX headwinds and but have materially increased our revenue and EPS expectations during the year.
I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. I'm really pleased with our Q3 results, and I'm extremely proud of the people here at Motorola and how our team continues to execute across all areas of the business. We achieved record Q3 sales in both segments, EPS is up by 28%. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points, and we ended the quarter with a record ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19%. And again, that's in the face of some significant FX headwinds.
Second, we continue to deliver these strong results while also continuing to invest in both new products and strengthening our ecosystem. During the quarter, we extended our successful APX NEXT device portfolio with three additional radios that support agencies of all sizes, personnel needs and budgets. We announced several new video integrations into CommandCentral Aware, bringing body-worn in car and emergency drone video feeds into the command center and we expanded our suite of cloud-connected cameras with the Ava Quad, a cloud-native forehead camera with built-in analytics.
And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business is strong. Our investments in the portfolio, combined with a robust funding environment are driving increased demand for our solutions, our supply chain execution and higher inventory is helping us navigate a continually challenging environment to meet this record demand and our record Q3 backlog positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth into 2023.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll open it up for your questions. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open. This is [indiscernible] on for Tim Long. I have two questions, if I may. You guys had mentioned in your release and prepared remarks about exiting your ESN contract. And just kind of trying to get a little bit more color there, is that just managing the contract? Or would that also be inclusive of the Kodiak revenue? And is there anything more you think you'll need to kind of concede in negotiations with the home office? And then just kind of given the raised guidance now, how should we kind of high level think about 2023 expectations? Thank you. Yes, in terms of ESN, Lisa, I think it's a result of ongoing conversations with the customer. I think more recently, they reached an advanced stage, kind of a late-stage negotiation where at this point, we think it's more likely than not that we will be exiting ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. We don't have an agreement signed with them at this point. But I think there's mutual interest in reaching that conclusion and we continue to work toward that end.
So I think we both think it's the right thing to do and a reasonable way forward. Look, in terms of 2023, and I know we have a lot of good news for the Q3 print. It's a little bit – a little bit early to think about. There's still a lot of moving parts. I think at this point in time, we think about revenue of about $9.5 billion in 2023. We expect at that level, we could grow within all three technologies. But it's also worth noting that there's still some things that we'll be dealing with into 2023.
I think that the supply chain constraints around semiconductor, which we're still experiencing, which is one example of why Jason referenced, we're carrying higher inventory purposely and carrying and paying more higher PPV premiums. But I think that those semiconductor supply chain challenges continue into next year and therefore, I think our higher inventory levels will continue well into 2023.
I also think, again, at the moment, we have FX headwinds that look about $150 million, of which, by the way, more than half of that would be actually in Q1 alone. And then one other just thing to think about for all of us in terms of 2023 is we expect about 200 to 300 basis points of higher tax rate headwinds in 2023 that will inform our thinking. But those are high-level chalk to field thoughts at this moment, and we would – we'll obviously give you the specifics in February. Lisa, if I could also add color to your question around ESN. So the revenues this year for ESN are going to be approximately $65 million. That includes some of the MCPTT as well as the integration and the project. As Greg mentioned, with the exit of the contract, that will go to zero in 2024. We're working through as part of the negotiation, what transition services and what that looks like in terms of revenue for next year. So we'll update you on that as it concludes. But $65 million in this year's top line results from ESN. Thank you so much. Thanks Lisa. We now turn to George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, guys, thanks very much and congratulations on all the growth and crisp execution here. I guess, I wanted to just keep going on the same line of questioning. Does the exit of the ESN contract help you in the renegotiation with Airwave? Obviously, you're negotiating with the home office and the CMA. I presume about a revised contract extension, but is this a negotiating point in that negotiation? How do you see it? Yes. I think just to remind you, look, the CMA investigation was undertaken with two tenants. One is our returns on Airwave and the evaluation of that. And secondarily, the apparent potential structural dual role of us being both in Airwave and ESN, we talked about the decision working with the customer to exit ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. I think the Airwave return issue obviously remains on the table. And while it's related to ESN, it's separate.
Now having said that, around the provisional decision that came out more recently, we disagree with the CMA's provisional decision and their findings, we still are convicted in our position. I think we feel the CMA's provisional decision is legally and economically flawed. I think it's not proportional.
It's unprecedented and overreaching. That said, we continue to stay in close conversation with the CMA and with the UK home office. It's kind of also ironic that as we are in the middle of this on Airwave, we coincidentally had the highest customer satisfaction score we've ever had for network performance of Airwave in the month of September, which included and incorporated all the planning around the Queen's funeral. So look, we'll continue to work it, and we will defend our position and pursue all legal avenues that are available to us, including appeals, if we think that's the right thing to do. Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Erik Lapinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to go back a little bit to the supply chain piece and just to make sure I fully understand some of the dynamics. It sounds like maybe things haven't really improved, but you did see a pretty good ramp in hardware sales during the quarter and maybe you're able to at least get supply but at a higher price.
So maybe if you could just give us a bit of an update on exactly kind of where you feel like we are in the supply environment. And then as we think about that in the context of backlog, just trying to understand a little bit better, we just hardware backlog ramped a lot. Was that due to supply constraints? Is that due to just a factor of kind of the growth you're seeing in shipping times? And just maybe some more details there would be really helpful. Thank you. Yes. Sure. I think we'll tag team this. But as I mentioned, I think the semiconductor supply constraints remain. Now there's a lot that's been said and written about softening demand and we're heading towards a recession, laptops, smartphones and PCs, that doesn't apply to us. The more legacy silicon and semiconductor supply that we embed into our solutions is more analogous to the automotive industry.
And as you've seen there, the automotive industry continues to be supply constrained. So we don't see a lot of relief. The progress we're making in satisfying this record demand is the decision to carry higher inventory to meet this record demand, pay more in PPV premiums, we had said we thought we'd spend $120 million for the full year. Jason just referenced, we're going to spend $150 million, that incremental $30 million is paying PPV premiums to satisfy demand.
And the third leg of the stool is product redesign. So I think the environment on supply is on the margins very slightly better but still challenging and stiff for us. We're doing the inventory, higher inventory, increased PPV spend and continued product redesign I've referenced in earlier calls to satisfy this record demand. I would add, Greg, that on the automotive front, most of the LMR componentry that we are looking to get is in 40 nanometers and greater that supports what's going on in automotive and heavy industry. And we’re having success in getting what we need. The $30 million incremental is not only a good business decision, it also aligns to customer prioritization and us needing to fulfill backlog that customers have been waiting for. So in particular, this quarter in Q3 and again in Q4, we anticipate strong PCR shipments where we’re getting to parts of the portfolio that had been delayed in getting componentry for. So PCR, for example, this year, while we thought it could grow here or would grow with constraints of 15% last quarter for the year. We now anticipate it’s going to grow 20%. So we’re getting access to the components necessary to unlock some of that PCR backlog as an example. By the way, it also has helped the higher inventory decisions, has also helped in video security and access control as well. We now expect that growth annually to be 25% for this year, up from 20%. And the higher inventory has afforded us a position to take some incremental share both in video and PCR because of the available product. It can be a competitive advantage in this market for sure. Awesome. Thanks, guys. Well, congrats on the execution. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Hi. This is Ryan Cui on for Sami. Thanks for taking the question. So I have two questions. First is, can you remind us how many round of price increase have been done so far? And is there another round of price increase should we like expected considering the alike inflation level of tax. So our results for the year are going to be driven by both volume and price. The second half of this year will be even more supported by price because many of the actions we put into place earlier in the year have begun to impact the second half as we churn through prior backlog. So we’ve done a variety of value-based pricing across the portfolio. They’re helping enable as we expected, our growth and our results in the second half. We’ll continue to look at that, Jack and team around the near $800 million of R&D that we spend per year does differentiate our solutions and the work the team is doing on pricing to price to value. Got you. I appreciate that. If I can squeeze in another one. So are you seeing any like signs of like potential slowdown, especially in the EU market considering the broad like concern from macroeconomic risk? We’re not seeing that. I think that the Q3 print, I think, speaks for itself. And again, I can’t thank the people across Motorola Solutions enough. I think the execution and focus has been superb. And there’s a lot of moving parts, right? The historical pressure on the dollar, continued supply challenges, a lot of moving parts, but we’re not. And also further reinforced by ending the quarter with record Q3 backlog, so I think demand remains strong. Right, just to piggyback on that, when you really – when you think about our business outside of public safety, our next biggest vertical is education, which obviously given the initiatives around safe schools, around access control, analytics, that’s been a hot market and there’s not only funding through the American Rescue Plan, there’s also funding being pointed at that through the Bipartisan Safe Cities Act, which directly addresses access, egress, ingress issues at schools. Got you. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. We now turn to Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you. I wanted to, Greg, return to the ESN conversation on the exit. I think a lot of investors view that as kind of the hedge to Airwave potentially going away at some point, kind of like having both LTE and LMR, so I wanted to understand why the strategic business decision to exit given it seemed like a hedge that you had? And then what does that mean for ESN? Is that network retired? Does it change hands? What becomes the Airwave alternative after this? And Jason, if you can talk about $65 million – go ahead, Greg. I don’t mean to throw too much out there. No, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, keep going on. We want to get everything to the other. Go ahead. I’m sorry. I was just going to sneak in for Jason. He said $65 million of revenue, but my understanding was this wasn’t the highest profitability. So I just wanted to understand the profitability impact of this. Yes. On the first question, I don’t think we ever looked at ESN as a hedge. We were asked way back when to bid on it. We did. I think we’ve fulfilled our deliverables. We’ve been fully committed to this project. And we’ve worked closely with the customer. And again, what I said, they’re – obviously, they’re interrelated Airwave and ESN. They’re the same customer and ESN has plans to be a certain network by the UK home office. But I never viewed ESN as a hedge. I viewed it as building a lot to from MSI and delivering on the expectations they had for us.
As the discussions advance this year and more recently in the past quarter, I think there’s a mutual agreement. It’s the right thing to do to exit. Now the original contract, it was expiring at the end of 2024 anyway. So I think we both felt it was the right thing to do. As Jason said $65 million of revenue about this year and goes to zero in 2024. And for next year, it’s obviously less than $65 million, but that has to be worked out in a final agreement with transition terms that predicate exactly what that looks like for next year. And in terms of margin, you’re right; it’s lower than the rest of S&S. You think of it as a custom integration project in addition to us supplying them to MCPTT. So it’s an integration like margin profile on that $65 million. And Adam, I’d point to you to the U.S. where we are a subcontractor to AT&T for all things FirstNet, which is a 4G now evolving to 5G, high-speed LTE network, and we participate in that. And at the same time, we continue to grow and build LMR here domestically in the states. And in fact, we see record demand for LMR here in the U.S., while simultaneously participating in FirstNet. So I don’t see it as a hedge, and I don’t see it as a trade-off per se. Got it. Okay. And then the other subject, I wanted to talk about the price cost equation in your business model. I mean we can debate when the $150 million of cost comes out of the model from a timing perspective, but I think we can all agree that’s probably not permanent. It’s going to come out at some point. And I’m wondering when that happens, what’s your intention with price at that point? You’ve implemented all these price increases. Would there be a need to reduce price at that point? Or do you think price sticks $150 million comes out and we might be looking at a structurally different level of margin in your business? We view the price increases on our products as stickier than the $150 million of temporary market conditions that really are driven by brokers and third-parties extracting maximum value in a scarce commodity play right now. So we’ve had good success in looking through the portfolio and engaging with our customers, and we’ll continue to procure the parts that we need to at the parts – at the prices that are market driven right now. But as we look forward, there’s opportunity there. Yes. The other thing I would remind you, when you think about 2023 is, as we said, we expect inventory to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. And second, we’ve prioritized public safety shipments this year, so we have some lower tier PCR sitting in backlog that will have to flush through in Q4 and also into next year being a little bit of a counterweight to just a peel off of that $150 million. Is there a simple way to think about the price spend? I mean the $150 million is really easy for us to understand. Is there a way to think of price was x dollars in 2022 and an incremental x dollars in 2023? Or is it just too complicated to do that? No, I would say this. For 2022, the growth we’ve had is both volume and price. Year-to-date, for the full year, Adam, we expect the growth to be volume and price increases, but with volumes still being a little bit more than half, it would be maybe appropriate to dimensionalize some further thoughts around pricing in February, but that’s the best we could give you at this point in time. Understood. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. We now turn to Fahad Najam from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you first the fuller clarification. Also, your S&S backlog, how much of it is from ESN? Is that about $100 million? $99 million of contract value was reduced. So that’s a reduction in backlog. Yes. Okay. So that’s the entirety of the ESN backlog you were carrying in the S&S. There’s no additional related projects from that, right, in that $99 million. That’s right. Yes, the decision to exit the ESN contract as most probable reduced our backlog by $99 million for future contracts as well as we had a non-cash charge of $147 million off the balance sheet, corresponding to our project and the delivery. Those are the two numbers that I think are most relevant to financially what we’ve decided is the most likely outcome. Got it. Thank you. Now to my questions. Greg, in terms of how much of your revenue you’re being benefited from stimulus funds? Are you still expecting the majority of funds to show up next year? Just kind of take us through how you’re thinking about calendar 2023. I appreciate the initial outlook, you said with us. But maybe if you could double click maybe what’s driving that? Sure. So it’s always important to probably take it back and point out that what we do, it’s a need to have and not a nice to have. But with that said, we’ve got $200 million year-to-date through Q3 in revenue that’s tied in some way to the American Rescue Plan. The bigger thing to point to is this is a multiyear phenomenon, the ARP funds run through 2024 in all likelihood, some element of that will be extended as well. I think it’s actually $200 million year-to-date quarter. You’re right. Yes. Good clarification. All right. Appreciate the answers. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We now turn to Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So you mentioned you feel comfortable with that $9.5 billion in 2023 initially. Can you kind of expand on the pace of growth you expect between segments? Can we still see that 20% type growth and video and as we start to think about gross margins for next year, can you kind of quantify the uplift, we should kind of expect it? Hopefully you start to see some component pricing come down and supply chain costs also come down? Yes. I think Paul; the color I'm giving in the $9.5 billion is really that, it meant to be more directional than specific. I think we will reserve the individual specifics around segments and technologies when we have the next earnings call in February. I would say though, it has been our ongoing goal and history from a margin standpoint anyway and I'd say operating margins that aspirationally we would look to expand operating margins again in 2023, but we want to see the Q4 print, the disposition of the backlog that will inform us better on the specifics in February around more detail from a segment and technology view. Got it. Appreciate that. And then to follow-up on free cash flow guide that kind of implies a record ramp here in 4Q. What are some risks here across working cap to hitting that guide and your visibility into cast flows and are you starting to see some component pricing even a bit helping in 2023? Thank you. Our Q4 cash flow call is supported by almost $900 million of higher sales in the second half; tremendous AR opportunity. We've had better linearity we did in Q3 and we'll have it again in Q4 anticipate so around getting products out the door sooner in the quarter such that they can turn to cash within the quarter, we call it quick turn. And then of course we are anticipating lower payments and slightly lower inventory to end the year. Half of our current elevated $1.157 billion inventory level, so we anticipate we had a good Q3 operating cash flow and we anticipate having another very good Q4 in getting to the 1,775 [ph] that we talked about during my portion of the call. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Good afternoon guys, I appreciate it. Greg, you talk mentioned that the Airwave perhaps the appeals process, can you provide little color about what options actually Motorola will have if the CMA does is successful coming through with this proposal, adjustments for the Airwave? Yes. Thank you Keith. Again decision that came out was provisional. We don't expect a final decision until early next year. To your question, it's worth mentioning that after a final decision there is then a remedy implementation phase that actually takes a few more months to sort out what the final ruling is in terms of how to implement. I think, I think statutorily that has to be done no later than I think it's nine or 10 months after the final decision. So that takes time to do that.
I told you that we are convicted in our position and while we are obviously going to continue to work with the CMA and the customer. We think the founding's in the provisional are unfounded and overreaching and unprecedented. By the way it's worth also mentioning there is a notation in the actual provisional decision that includes an potential invitation for the home office and us to agree to a different arrangement than what the CMA has proposed. That's explicit and referenced embedded in the provisional. We would certainly be open to that conversation, and so we'll see how things develop, but there's several more months to go here. Appreciate it. And then I'm going to actually get – I'll ask a different question from my follow-up if I could. The video surveillance going from 20% to 25% growth for the year, I goes could you guess by a bit of color about some of that strength there? Obviously it's been notable that some of your Chinese competitors are getting some more challenges, I guess, for lack of a better word around the country – around the world. Is that contributing to that growth? I think you were clipping in and out, but I think that the direction of your question is the kind of the inertia against some Chinese suppliers adding to our growth this year? I think the answer is yes, but actually it's kind of measured because remember under the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act at the fed level it prohibits future procurement from Huawei, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua, ZTE it is not a rip and replace. So I don't think there's the pop the clutch moment of big growth there, which is the same thing in terms of the NDAA provision around grant money.
The other positive move that could help as a potential tailwind kind of circumstantially will be the Secure Equipment Act at the FCC level, which by the way could be as early as November, but it also could take more time. But if the FCC follows along the lines or contours of the NDAA, that could potentially prohibit in the case of LMR, Hytera procurement. And in the case of video security Hikvision and Dahua future procurement for the enterprise, that would be favorable. So clearly it’s a favorable trend, but – and I think it's a contributor but I don't think it's an overwhelming driver to the results we're printing to date. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Keith. My final question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Education, you highlighted great on your comments, which is great to hear. Can you give us a little bit of insights about like percent of sales now versus an importantly outlook? It seems like that's a growing area. I mean, just recently our school PTA had a meeting talking about the situation of putting in technology and I actually recommended your type of products and – but it's a long discussion. And so can you talk about kind of the timeline there of what you're seeing? And the profitability, I assume continues to increase as certain other school districts start to seed solutions to other school districts. And it kind of starts to self market itself at some point, but the initial kickoff seems pretty hard? Thank you so much. Jim, you nailed it. It is a game of inertia, but just to di-mensionalize it, think of it as around 25% of our fixed video security and access control business. The one thing that we've been very thoughtful around the investments we've made not only organically, it started with the Avigilon and the investments we've made organically there, but the acquisitions by way of Ava and Openpath because what we're seeing, and as you pointed out, larger school districts may want an on-prem solution, and a lot of the money that are being directed now are actually at a private and smaller schools, and they might want a cloud-based solution. So we feel like we've got – obviously we've got the ability to meet the customers depending on their needs for where they are. In terms of growth rate, you've seen the print we have 33% growth. Education is growing in that category so it's roughly a quarter of our fixed video security business growing approximately 30% this year. And this is also an area of investment as we further integrate all of our portfolio in and around Safer Schools. Mahesh, maybe you could talk about some of the things we're doing to integrate the portfolio, so to better position our portfolio to keep schools safe. Introduced this program called Safety Reimagined not just long ago; and a key element – a technology element of Safety Reimagined was a solution called Orchestrate and one of the things that Orchestrate enables us to do is to really coordinate the detection capabilities of our AI enabled fixed cameras to actions that are possible within the school, including notifications to radios as well and all of this enables effective public private partnership even during a response timeframe. So when you put it all together it actually takes advantage of the entirety of the Motorola Solutions portfolio, and we are uniquely positioned to go in and solve specific problems for schools. Thank you so much for the details and congratulations. Thank you, Jim. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll not turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining us Thursday afternoon. Look, I just want to summarize and just say thank you to everybody. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, significant FX headwinds increasing inflation and the fed raising interest rates, despite all of that we continue to grow. We continue to grow based on volume and some pricing power. We're raising expectations on top and bottom for the full year. We've delivered on capital allocation strategy year-to-date investing more than $1.3 billion, but most importantly we continue to meet the needs of our customers.
I mean, the environment is strong, exceptionally strong, strong funding, record orders, record backlog and while we're really proud of the Print, I'm also equally proud of that we're printing these results while still investing in the business and in the portfolio to differentiate ourselves accordingly. Like our position heading into 2023 and I am deeply grateful and thankful to everybody at Motorola Solutions. A hell of a quarter and by the way particularly all of those you – of you in Florida, the systems integration team, the services team during Hurricane Ian the strength of our LMR networks shown through but even more importantly the courage and the pride of our people showed through two time and time again. I'm grateful and I'm proud of you.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
I'll now turn it over to Greg. Thanks, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and the outlook. First, our record Q4 results highlight the continued robust demand we're seeing for our public safety and enterprise security solutions. During the quarter we grew revenue 17%, earnings per share of 26%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points, and generated a record $1.3 billion of operating cash flow.
Additionally, orders remained strong, which led to record ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up $800 million versus last year. Second, 2022 was an outstanding year across the board. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we grew revenue 14% driven by strong growth in both LMR and video security and we ended the year with record backlog, up 22% versus last year.
We also expanded operating margins in the segment by 110 basis points despite higher costs related to semiconductors. In Software and Services, revenue was up 8% and 12% when normalized for FX headwinds, highlighted by double-digit growth in both video security and Command Center. And finally, as I look to 2023 [Technical Difficulty] positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 17% with record fourth quarter revenue in both segments and in all three technologies. Revenue exceeded our guidance and was driven by supply chain execution during the quarter, enabling higher product revenues in LMR. FX headwinds during the quarter were $87 million, while acquisitions added $39 million.
GAAP operating earnings were $692 million, up 26% versus last year and GAAP operating margins were 25.6% compared with 23.7% in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $822 million [Technical Difficulty] GAAP operating margin was 30.4%, up from 28.9%. This was Motorola Solutions' first ever quarter of over 30% operating margin and was driven by the higher sales in both segments and the improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment.
GAAP earnings per share was $3.43, up from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter on higher sales and on a lower effective tax rate driven primarily by a $47 million or $0.27 per share tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against U.S. foreign tax credits. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.60, up 26% from $2.85 last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. OpEx in Q4 was $541 million, up $21 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives. For the full-year 2022, revenue was $9.1 billion, up 12% with strong growth in both segments and across all three technologies. The impact from unfavorable currency was $216 million and revenue from acquisitions was $121 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 18.2% of sales versus 20.4% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by the $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment recognized in the current year related to our exit of ESN.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.4 billion, up $251 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 26% of sales, up from 25.9% in the year prior, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs, and higher expenses from acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share was $7.93, up 11% compared to the $7.17 in the year prior, driven by higher sales, a lower effective tax rate and partially offset by the asset impairment charge related to the ESN exit and higher material costs.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.36, up 13% from $9.15 in 2021 on higher sales, improved -- and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. For the full year, our operating expenses were $2.1 billion, up $107 million from 2021, primarily driven by acquisitions and investments into our video business. And the effective tax rate for 2022 was 20% compared to 21% in the year prior, due to higher benefits from stock based compensation in the current year.
Turning next to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was a record $1.3 billion, up $570 million compared with the prior year, and free-cash-flow was $1.2 billion, up $565 million from 2021. Our record cash-flow performance during the quarter was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. And for the full year, operating cash flow was $1.8 billion with free cash flow of $1.6 billion, consistent with the prior year. Higher earnings in 2022 were offset by the cash payments related to the increase in annual incentive payments earned in 2021 and higher inventory. Capital allocation for 2022 included $1.2 billion for acquisitions, $836 million in share repurchases at an average price of $225 per share, and $530 million in cash dividends. Additionally, during the year we issued $600 million of new long-term debt and repaid $275 million of outstanding debt. We also increased our dividend to 11%, our 12th consecutive year of double-digit increases.
Moving next to our segment results. In Products and SI, strong demand continued with Q4 sales up 21%, including record revenue in both LMR and video. The currency headwinds were $43 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million. Operating earnings in Q4 were $514 million or 28.4% of sales, up from 25.3% in the year prior, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include several large APX NEXT device orders, including $45 million from the City of Houston, $39 million from a large U.S. customer, $30 million from the City of Dallas, and a $21 million add-on order from a large U.S. customer that previously purchased APX NEXT devices.
Additionally, during the quarter, we received a $20 million APX NEXT and Command Center order from Kansas City, a $19 million P25 System order for a large international customer, and a $3 million fixed order for metro rail in Chicago. For the full year, Products and SI revenue was $5.7 billion, up 14% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $53 million and currency headwinds were $98 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 20.5% of sales, up from 19.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs.
In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was 9% -- up 9%, which included $44 million of FX headwinds, and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% with double-digit growth in both video and Command Center, while in LMR Services revenue was up 5% after a $39 million FX headwind. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $308 million or 34.4% of sales, down 100 basis points from last year, driven by unfavorable mix and higher acquisition expenses.
Some notable Q4 highlights in this segment include a $56 million P25 multi-year extension of the managed services operations at Interexport which serves the Chilean National Law Enforcement Police; a $25 million P25 software upgrade renewal for a large U.S. customer; $22 million next generation 911 expansion, and renewal order for the Greater Harris County, Texas area; $21 million system upgrade in multiyear services renewal for Lane County Oregon; a $15 million P25 and command center upgrade order for Columbus, Georgia; and a $15 million license plate recognition camera system expansion order from the Illinois State Police.
For the full year, revenue was $3.4 billion, up 8% on growth in video LMR services and command center. Revenue from acquisitions was $68 million and currency headwinds were $118 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 35.3% of sales, down 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by mix and higher acquisition expenses.
Looking at our regional results. North America in Q4 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 18% on strong growth in both segments and in all three technologies. For the full year, North America revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% with double-digit growth in both segments and in all three technologies. International Q4 revenue was $808 million, up 15% versus last year with growth in all three technologies. And for the full-year, International revenue was $2.7 billion, up 5% inclusive of the significant FX headwinds.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.3 billion, up $788 million or 6% compared to last year, inclusive of $418 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million reduction related to the exit of the ESN contract. The backlog growth was driven by the continued record demand we're seeing across all three technologies.
Sequentially, backlog was up $837 million, despite the record Q4 sales with growth in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $894 million or 22% compared to last year. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $68 million. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment.
In Software and Services, backlog was down $106 million compared to last year, which included $367 million of unfavorable FX, driven by Airwave and ESN revenue recognition and the ESN exit, partially offset by strong growth in North America multi-year services, and software contracts. Sequentially, Software and Services backlog was up $769 million or 9% driven by strong orders in North America and favorable FX adjustment from the prior quarter.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 12% and 13%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.02 and $2.07 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we expect sales between $9.65 billion and $9.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%.
We expect full-year OpEx to be up approximately $150 million versus last year, driven by acquisitions we've made, and our continued investments in video. And we expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. And finally, the reason our effective tax rate is expected to be up 300 basis points to 400 basis points over last year is due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in 2023 and a higher U.K. tax rate that takes effect in April. We're also anticipating approximately $300 million of higher cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $75 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization we did in 2022.
Before I turn the call back to Greg, I wanted to update you on some strategic decisions we've made with respect to our PCR business. First, in order to further optimize our supply chain, we have moved the lowest part of PCR, which is sold to small businesses and some consumers to a licensed model with a third-party manufacturer. As a result of this change, we will only recognize revenues equal to the margin from the product.
In addition, we made a decision to exit some PCR markets in Asia. We expect these changes together to constitute an $80 million headwinds to our 2022 -- 2023 revenues, which is fully contemplated in our full-year revenue guidance for 2023. And finally, we enter the New Year with an even stronger balance sheet. We ended 2022 with $1.3 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times. In addition, our U.S. pension is in a strong funding position with over 80% funded reflecting the numerous actions we've implemented over the last several years.
We have also proactively refinanced our debt maturities with fixed-rate long-term debt and established a balanced maturity profile with an average duration of approximately eight years. All of this gives us the flexibility to continue to deliver on our capital allocation framework and be opportunistic in M&A.
I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. First, 2022 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year with record sales in both segments and all three technologies. We expanded operating margins despite the continued supply challenges related to semiconductors and we ended the year with a record $14.3 billion of backlog, up almost $800 million versus the prior year.
Second, our acquisition of Rave Mobile Safety during Q4 was our seventh acquisition last year. Rave adds approximately $70 million of annual recurring revenue for 2023 and expands the company's addressable market by approximately $7 billion. Whether it's a student or a teacher alerting public safety with the push of a button or 911 call takers coordinating a more informed response, Rave Mobile Safety amplifies the connection between our video security and Command Center portfolios. Since 2015, we've invested almost $6 billion in acquiring companies that have helped us create a broad set of public safety and enterprise security solutions. These assets have helped to accelerate our revenue growth, diversify the composition of our revenue streams, and more than quadrupled our addressable market to what we now estimate to be $60 billion.
And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business remains strong. The funding environment for public safety and enterprise security remains exceptional. Our investments in APX NEXT device portfolio are driving a refresh cycle that is still in the very early days with less than 10% of customers' installed base upgraded to date.
Our AI and Cloud solutions continue to help drive market-share gains in video security and command center software, and will continue to navigate the ongoing supply-chain challenges, I'm extremely pleased with how we're positioned as we enter this year and I expect it to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for the company.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll take your questions. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? Yes, sir. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Thank you. Greg, maybe could you just give us a little sense of the backdrop, it sounds like obviously backlog was pretty strong, but talk a little bit about kind of federal ARPA and other revenue sources? How is that starting to flow through? How are your customers taking advantage of that and what do you think that means to visibility over the next few years?
And then Jason, for you on the clarification, just talk a little bit about gross margins. Maybe walk us through the next year at some point we should be getting some bounce-back from components and logistics and maybe just touch on price increases that we've seen and how that would flow through the model and hit the gross margins next year? Thank you. So, this is Jack. I'll take the first question. I think it was regarding the federal funding, but really good news. So we had over $400 million of orders in 2022. But I think most importantly, the $350 billion that was allocated state and local is a multiyear funding phenomenon. So we look at our multiyear funnel out through 2026 at being north of $1 billion. Some of the deals that Jason cited were funded in part or in -- completely funded by ARPA dollar. So we've had good success. Our team is really -- our sales team in North America traditionally really understands funding models and I think they're working it well, and we've seen good results. And Tim, I'll also remind you that the ARPU funding, $350 billion for state and local, $170 billion earmarked for education, but most importantly, it's multiyear funding and much of this will go into and through 2026. So, the foundation of funding and the strong environment Jack described, we capitalized in 2022 as he talked about the robustness of the funnel this year. But the best part of all is, it's multiyear dimension in nature. And Tim, I'll take the second part of your question. So as you recall, as we navigated through 2022 and having to secure parts from brokers, that year 2022 last year, we incurred about $165 million of higher costs for semiconductors in 2022 than 2021, that was a headwind for us. We -- we're able to get access to some parts in Q4. That's in part what helped our Q4 performance.
So as we plan for 2023 now, we anticipate still needing to run the play of buying broker parts, it's still remains a difficult environment, particularly for automotive-grade semiconductors, but we do believe and are planning for about a $50 million tailwind in the total amount of dollars that we will allocate and spend to secure parts as for the plans we have in 2023. So $50 million tailwind in 2023 relative to 2022's cost profile. And Tim, from a gross margin perspective overall for MSI, we expect gross margins to be up in 2023. We also expect operating margins to be up in 2023. Okay. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks very much. It sort of feels like somebody forgot to tell you guys that we're in a recessionary environment. The business seems to be cranking on all cylinders here. Greg, anything you worry about in terms of a recessionary environment at all? I mean, I get it the ARPA funds are kind of backfilling maybe for any softness that you could see out over the horizon. But any thoughts about tax receipts, whether its property tax or income tax receipts ultimately slowing down a year or two from now impacting the business? George, the answer is, no, to be candid with you. The environment is strong, the funding environment, as we talked about is exceptional, 75% of our business, as you know, as government and public safety, 25% is enterprise. We still see continued strength. This year we expect growth in all three technologies LMR to be mid-single digits, video security to be about 15%, command center to be about 20%. So -- and there was an article in the journal last weekend, the state budgets are as flush as they had been in several years.
We talked already about the multiyear funding horizon for ARPA. Now, nobody is immune from a recession. We've always been diligent in managing the expense structure of the firm. The majority of the driver of higher OpEx for this company year on year and period on period is generally acquisitions. So, I think we have a great portfolio, a fantastic environment, strong demand, and we are acutely focused on continued execution, new product development, acquisition integration, and growing faster than the market versus our competitors.
So, now I -- look, sometimes they worried that I'm not worried, okay? But the team is aligned and we feel really good about where we are. Appreciate the question. Also Greg... And then just one quick follow-up, if I could. Any -- what kind of impact are you getting in the business, from higher pricing, just thinking about the growth rate as we look out to 2023? So, I would say the growth that we had last year, full-year was driven by both volume and price increase. I'd weight it a little bit more toward volume last year. That composition that drives our growth rate overall for this year is also volume and price. And I would weight it slightly towards volume again this year. We've exercised surgically and responsibly certain price increases that we've talked about a number of times last year. So, I think we're well-positioned going forward. Thank you. Greg, the other thing that I’d offer insights into are our PCR business which in 2022 grew nicely. It's now back to 2019 levels. And a part of our backlog or unfulfilled orders for us or delays are in PCR. So we have a sizable amount of PCR backlog and demand, which we will continue to fulfill into 2023. And it's a great point, Jason because despite the fact that we had a great PCR Q4, really strong growth for the full year to Jason's point back to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And he referenced an $80 million PC-oriented headwind, which represents a business model change even with those -- all those ingredients into the blender, we still are expecting PCR growth for 2023. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start with the question, Greg. If there was any potential updates that we could give our guardrails on the potential outcomes for Airwave at this point? We understand, obviously, you've got some tailwinds to the model from managing costs and supply chain. The potential headwind looming is what could happen with Airwave. So just want to make sure that we're netting those things out and any guardrails you can give us on where that could potentially shape out? So what I'd say is, I'd remind you that CMA their stated intention is to make a final decision this month, maybe it's next month, but it's relatively soon. We remain unchanged in our finding and belief that with full conviction that their effort is disproportionate, it's unprecedented, it's overreaching. So our view on that is unchanged. Now recall the investigation -- the market investigation is grounded around Airwave and ESN. What I can update you on is that, we have successfully signed a contract with the UK Home Office to exit ESN. I think it was a good multi-month effort where both of us are satisfied, that will result, Adam, in us exiting ESN earlier than anticipated. We are doing a transition services agreement in 2023, but then effectively after 2023 we are out of ESN. So, I think that is an update that's worthy of sharing because a quarter ago we talked about our intention to do that, but that was before we actually codified and signed the agreement.
Now having said all that, I think, look, as we guide the full-year we guide the full-year with the $80 million business model change around PCR. We guide the year both top and bottom with continued supply constraints and I think it's important to know that, because there's a lot of reports that supply chain is a lot better but for the businesses that we're in and we compete primarily with industrial providers or automotive for the semiconductors that we're contending for, it's not that changed, lead times actually are largely unchanged. So that informs our guidance as well and as we sit here, on February 9th, we think all-in, it's a prudent and balanced view of the year all things considered. All right. And maybe just a follow-up on Rave. Obviously, spending over $0.5 billion, I'm sure there was a lot that went into that decision. Greg, I'd love for you to maybe just talk about the expected ROI in any financial metrics. Sorry, if I missed any that you could provide related to that acquisition to justify that level of capital allocation? Thank you. Yeah, so we are very excited about the asset. And the important thing, Adam, is it's an asset that's worth more to us than anyone else. So when you think about the capital deployed against the backdrop of an addressable market that expands $7 billion and all ARR, annual recurring revenue with a run rate of $70 million that we like those attributes, their verticals. 80% of the business is profiled around state and local and education, which that too is absolutely in the sweet spot of what we do and how Molloy goes to market.
So the asset we're excited about, I think it's worth and we think it's worth more to us than anyone else and we've done an extensive view of the industry as well and we're excited about what it means. A few more things to add on this. Greg already mentioned the vertical alignment that we have here, state and local government, education, which is significant for us, healthcare and corporate buildings. All of these are key areas where Rave plays a very important part. In Rave very critically as we mentioned before, connects enterprise security with public safety in some very unique ways and augments both sides of the portfolio. Probably three areas, technology areas that I want to highlight.
The first is Rave enhances individual safety with mobile apps. So think about that as the Rave prepared capability where people with special needs can actually create a profile and offer information ahead of potentially something happening so that the response can actually be more effective.
The second is the panic button. The ability to push a button and get help as needed, benefiting from what profile was created previously as needed as well. Rave Alert, which is a mass notification capability to keep people informed. So think about that as everything that covers people -- people's in safety, individual safety. The second area is facility preparedness. So think about the Rave facility capability where information about a facility can better inform a public safety response, including keeping responders safe and that's a very critical capability.
Rave Collaborates help set up standard operating procedures of how someone should respond for various incidents ahead of when an incident actually happens. This very uniquely enables us to coordinate the ability that we have on the video security side and the command center side to make sure that the standard operating procedure along with the automation that sits behind it can orchestrate a very successful and capable response.
And lastly, the third area is that it accelerates response as a whole. The Rave 911 suite provides very critical information to both 911 and dispatchers in terms of location information of where individuals are, other information, such as video directly from the site, and also Reva allows for cross-jurisdictional information sharing. You take all those three capabilities with enterprise security and command center, it really enhances our overall portfolio. And as Greg said, the one plus one here is actually much greater than two. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. Thank you. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Maybe following up on kind of that Rave response, which was very helpful just kind of in laying out the integration. I guess just is there any timeline to kind of integrating the solution that your Video solution or Command Center could kind of interoperate more seamlessly with Rave, or is that already kind of built into the solution? Just kind of getting a sense of when the one-to-one really does become more than two and if there's any timeline to that?
And then maybe just a second question. Obviously, the backlog has grown pretty significantly. Are there any meaningful changes to duration that we should just be mindful of when thinking about that backlog and how it would peel off? Thank you. Just starting with the timeline elements. There are many elements of what I just outlined that already exist today, and they are integrated in various ways today. What we would like to do, and that's -- this is the future-looking element of it where we unify more of these solutions within our Command Center product portfolio, but also the Video Security and Access Control portfolio. And that is to come, and that it helps us enhance the use cases and make our products more differentiated. But some of the key capabilities in terms of being able to connect a detection that happens on the public safety side, and that's leading to an informed response on the command center side, whether that's 911 or dispatch, those capabilities exist today. And along with the incident, mass notification capability, being able to appropriately alert people, inform people during a situation, all those capabilities exist today. So there's more to come on this, but the base capability where the one plus one is greater than two, that's today. On the backlog. So our backlog, not only is it up in total to the $14.3 billion, it's up $900 million in products. And the duration of our backlog is even better than it had been last year. So we're in a strong position for backlog as well as the continued expectation for the orders that we execute on during the year. Great, thanks. Thanks, Meta. Thank you. Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Hi, thank you very much, and congrats to what's a very robust 4Q and very robust 2023 guidance. My question has to do with the APX NEXT orders and just the typical refresh rates of public safety institutions and how they order your radios. The question is, are the ARPA funds and are the elevated levels of state and local budget catalyzing a compression in the typical refresh rate of LMR radios, which is partially explaining the strength you're seeing in LMR? Sami, it's Jack. So as I said, I believe it was in the August call that we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle in North America. A couple of things to point out. Number one, APX NEXT was introduced at the highest tier of the market, and that's where it's been focused. Just recently, meaning the second half of 2022, we've filled in that portfolio. So now we have a mid-tier APX NEXT available. That in and of itself will be an accelerant for a lot of what you call suburban and county municipalities outside of the big cities. We've done $370 million of orders since the product was announced.
To give you a feel for the accelerant, $210 million of orders in 2022. And without question, the ARPA funding will be an accelerant to -- it used to be a 10-year kind of refresh cycle, we've seen that pull into like a seven-year refresh cycle. But I'd point you to the City of Houston that actually leverage largely ARPA funds, but actually use some budgets that they had surpluses in their own budget to move forward this device. I think there's a few things that really driving this. People want to do more with their device. And so, clearly, the ability to extend the network as people go to do mutual [indiscernible] events, SmartConnect, the owner experience. I mean a big city police department, it's tough to get technicians. It used to take them 10,000 man hours to actually upgrade software, cyber fixes and those kind of bug refreshes, that can be done in 10 minutes now, leveraging the LTE compatibility.
And the last thing is location matters. And what we've seen is GPS provisioning that capability even through our CAD networks has been a big add for our customers. And so there's clearly been a lot of excitement. You've seen a lot of very marquee police departments. And I think with the mid-tier series launching, I think we're going to continue to see that accelerant. And just to be clear, we did $210 million of orders last year. I expect to do double that this year. And it's fair to say I think -- I think APX NEXT is probably the most successful LMR product we've launched, certainly in my tenure and the most successful for all of the reasons that Jack talked about, private network, public network, seamless roaming, LMR to LTE and all the operational cost savings. Yes, obviously, the funding environment helps, but the product itself is so strong in what it does and unique in its capabilities, I think that is as significant as anything. Got it. Thank you for giving us color. The one other follow-up question is, I think we can clearly see where you guys are going with Rave mobility. But I think the bigger question for analysts is when we look at Rave, when we look at Ava Security, and we look at a bunch of these other acquisitions you have made, they all look like they're going to have to be integrated on the back end and then offered in a much more broader way to a lot of your customers for much bigger type of consumption model. How far away -- how far away are you guys from offering this or being market-ready with a fully integrated suite in the back end that can really service the front-end consumption side? So I think we've talked about our Safety Reimagined program a few times before. And a key element of that Safety Reimagine program is actually to bring all these elements together in an integrated fashion and facilitate the orchestration of incident response in a manner where that response is more effective.
So with that in mind, we have actually spent time developing a piece of software called Orchestrate which actually starts connecting these different pieces together and very visually allows enterprise security professionals and even public safety professionals to be able to say, this is how the automation behind the scenes of events going from, say, us being able to detect [indiscernible] visually in the field of view of camera should trigger, say, an access control lockdown, that access control lockdown in turn can perhaps trigger a mass notification to people in the facility, that mass notification then -- following that triggers a call to 911, dispatchers are now informed as to where individuals are. This is -- these are capabilities that between our Collaborate platform, our Orchestrate platform we're able to do today. And I think as a solution, we are starting to sell Safety Reimagined as a solution. In addition to the product integration and the road map that Mahesh described, I think, as Greg mentioned earlier, we're excited about Rave because it allows us to extend our sales channel to selling into public safety and education. So immediately, that organization gets the power of Jack Molloy's entire sales organization, selling the product as it is today into those accounts. And that in part is why we believe we're the most valuable owner of that asset. Sami, just a couple of other points I think are important to point out. We see the video security market, in particular, fixed video security, there really is a little bit of divergence in terms of view of on-prem customers that want an on-prem solution for certain critical infrastructure markets. And then you've seen another market that without question, from VMS -- from a video security, but also from an access control standpoint, they are starting to accelerate to cloud.
We've done a couple of things to take advantage. So moving forward, we're going to have the capabilities to deliver if you're an on-prem customer or you're a cloud customer, you'll be able to leverage the analytics that we've cultivated within our camera portfolio. That's important. The other thing that's important is, as you remember, we also acquired IndigoVision and Pelco. And we had three different essentially VMSs that we had to support. We've unified that experience under ACC8, Avigilon Control Center 8, which is our VMS. So there has been progress to your point. I just want to make sure you understood a couple of those things as well. Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to kind of look at the linearity of your outlook, you're guiding 1Q 2023 revenue to grow 12% to 13%, yet full year you're guiding maybe at 7% year-on-year growth. So kind of -- I understand lead times haven't changed for your supply chain, but the global supply chain outlook is indeed improving, you might see it later in the year. But still, I'm trying to question the linearity that you're implying it implies almost like a slowdown in the second half of the year, which sounds counterintuitive. So can you walk me through your assumptions? Sure. Fahad, I would point you to, first, the comp set from last year where in the first half, we grew at a rate of 8% and the second half a rate of almost double that. So if you look at last year's comps, it in part informs our expectations for growth this year. Secondly, we talked about this $80 million PCR business model change moving to license. The majority of that impact is occurring in the second half for us. That helps inform what we expect for growth all year, but higher growth in the first half.
And as Greg mentioned, with lead times unchanged, we forecast the business based on the lead times that our suppliers commit to us, and we update it as the year progresses. And our current guide is informed by our supply commitments. We just had a summit with our top 20 suppliers yesterday and have the latest information and commitments from them. And we'll continue to work the supply environment proactively, which we did in 2022. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask your thoughts on your revenue growth outlook for video surveillance. You've been talking 20% growth. But over the last two years, you've grown that business 30%-plus. If I'm not mistaken, the FCC has now recently announced a more wider band of that [indiscernible] Dahua products that has far bigger implications probably favorably for your business. So how should we be thinking about and how are you thinking about your video surveillance revenue growth in 2023? And how does this new SEC ban impact your business? Sure, Fahad. So our outlook for the 2023 is 15% growth. But I'd point out 15% off a pretty significantly difficult comp, we grew 24% in 2022. We've kind of said in general, we think the NDAA is generally conducive. And we think it's -- within the mix, it's a tailwind to the business. But we don't think it's going to have any real profound impact over the course of 2023. But we're really excited, particularly as the things I just outlined. Our portfolio is coming together. We now have offerings from an on-prem standpoint as well as a cloud standpoint. But again, I think 15%, I also think it's important to take a look at where we're getting that -- where we're generating that growth. Government and education are two largest verticals. And we think they're a little bit insulated in terms of if there is any kind of economic slowdown. And the other piece of it is health care and the commercial market space as well. Fahad, I'd also point out that some of the higher growth rates of Video Security, like in 2022 or before, the top revenue growth rate was in part driven by acquisitions. As you normalize those acquisitions and they go into the base and you look at the underlying strength of the growth rate between 2021 and 2022 and into 2023, it's much more comparable on a year-over-year basis. I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Thanks, Fahad. Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So can you talk about kind of the operating leverage benefits you're seeing in the model? And I mean, you saw kind of modest growth in OpEx despite record revenues this year and very strong organic top line. So as we think about next year, how do we think about the pace of spend, kind of incremental costs related to Rave and other acquisitions? And you also mentioned gross margins up this year. Can you expand on the magnitude of your expectations there and the shape throughout the year? And I have one follow-up. Sure. So I'll start with OpEx. I mentioned that we expect OpEx to be up $150 million this year. The primary drivers of that are, in fact, Rave, the recent acquisition, combined with investments that we continue to make within video, which is our fastest-growing technology.
In terms of leverage, we saw the leverage that we expected in the second half of 2022 on the operating line, and we expect continued operating margin expansion in 2023. I mentioned in part, $50 million of a tailwind in lower costs for us to attain the supply in 2023, then what we had to pay in 2022, that will largely benefit the product segment. And we'll continue to expand operating margins with both the volume and price growth drivers that Greg mentioned earlier. Okay. Great. And then on free cash flow, very strong performance here to end the year and despite $300 million working cap drag. It's always nice to see very strong earnings contribution kind of driving that free cash flow. But as we look to 2023, how do we think about working cap dynamics and overall trends for 2023, which could be a record year for free cash flow? Thank you. Sure. So we out looked $1.9 billion in operating cash flow. CapEx will be pretty similar to last year. For a number of years now, our CapEx as a percent of OCF is around 15%. It's actually less than the 20% that we have in our capital allocation model, and that's likely to continue. We are a low CapEx asset light kind of model. So as OCF, we expect growth in OCF, we'll have higher earnings. I did mentioned $225 million higher cash tax amount that we are incorporating into 2023 as well. But we'll see good earnings growth, good cash flow growth, and we'll continue to work through inventory. Inventory has been a helpful investment for us as we navigated 2022. We'll plan and are planning for it to come down in 2023 as we fulfill record demand, but we'll continue to use it as an asset. It served us well in getting customer and meeting customer demand, but we'll continue to work through lower inventories in 2023. Great, thank you. Thanks, Paul. Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys and congratulations on a great quarter and our consistent performance for you guys. As we think about your product and system integration business, obviously, we saw you guys call out a lot of the APX NEXT refreshes, but there's only one systems update that was included in that list. Can you guys kind of talk about the mix between the system upgrades versus the device upgrades that you guys are going through? And are you guys seeing more of a movement back toward your device upgrades? We're seeing both, Keith. The one thing I'd point to is that over the past several years, our customers have been transitioning to an always current upgrade arrangement, we call it SUA. It's a more predictable arrangement for them and keeps them on their journey technology wise. That revenue stream is more predictable for us. And a large number of customers in North America are on that journey for their infrastructure needs, which is a less lumpy systems business for us.
So we'll continue to see devices upgrades. We told you where we are in the early innings of that. And we'll see systems upgrades, but we'll see it come through the P&L in both a product-related upgrade, but in some cases, higher services revenue for systems upgrades. Jason, that's a good point. It's also -- this is pivoted more into a recurring revenue model and it will. There'll be elements of it in terms of replacing base stations for these networks that will continue to be an opportunity for us. But largely, it's come into software, meaning, it's an SUA program, as Jason pointed out, but also it's been -- it's been an accelerant for our Managed and Support Services business as well. Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up question here. [indiscernible] the guidance here, Command Center growth expectations above 20% for 2023. Is the primary driver of that is the integration of Rave? Or are you guys seeing success elsewhere starting to pay dividends? 20% includes the inorganic addition of Rave, but the rest of Command Center software also expected to grow low double digits, which is consistent with the expectation that we had and executed too in 2022. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question will come from Louie DePalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Louis, please make sure that you're unmuted. Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon. How are you? Doing well. Related to your Video division, the topic of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been in the financial mainstream recently with ChatGPT. Can you discuss how Motorola deserves to be in the conversation of leading AI vendors with some of your video analysis automation tech that you showcased at the IACP conference? And in general, how powerful are your AI tools now? And how has that progressed over the past couple of years? Thanks. Sure. So ChatGPT, the technology that I think has been in development for quite a long time, and it really benefits from lots of advances in natural language understanding, reinforcement learning, the GPT, that stands for generative pretrained transformers, and it's the third generation of that tool.
Now if you kind of break that up a little bit, the natural language elements of it, think of what we do on the smart transcription side, where we understand natural language, we are able to pick out entities that addresses names, license plate numbers, et cetera, and then map that into a capability to fill out forms, give supervisors a heads-up when a call taker potentially needs help, et cetera.
On the video side, think of it as what we're doing, where we're taking video and actually converting that to language, so facilitating things like natural language searches. So being able to understand what is the user asking for and mapping that effectively into a set of results that are returned based upon our automated analysis of video. And we're able to do that at the edge. And with our acquisition of Calipsa, we're able to extend that capability into the cloud. And one of the things that Calipsa with the cloud AI allows us to do is very rapidly give -- provide this capability to multiple different cameras across the board, across all our portfolios, Pelco specifically, Avigilon inclusive of that as well.
So those two things together give us the capability now to say, okay, if there's particular events that are happening, we can alert on them unusual activity being another one of them. So ChatGPT, I think, is just an indicator of one element or one area of machine learning that is really advanced. We're benefiting from multiple pieces of that across video understanding, across language understanding and audio understanding to the point where we're now implementing it across all our products. So hopefully, that's a rough answer to your question. Thanks. That was helpful. I'm sure you could talk for dozens of hours on that topic. One more question. Last week, Yes. Last week, the city of East Chicago and Indiana announced that it was deploying portable solar-powered video analytics platform from Avigilon. I was wondering, do you view solar powered cameras as a significant growth area for the Motorola video group? So there's probably two areas, I'm not entirely sure of the specific opportunity you're talking about. But more broadly, we do have Avigilon cameras that are deployed today with solar platforms for [indiscernible] deploy applications. Many times, this is for construction sites for sort of sports events that happen or concert events that happen and you need a rapidly deploy solution. That is 1 part of it. The other part of it is on our automatic license plate recognition solution. We introduced the L6Q camera towards the end of last year.
And that is a fully wireless solution. So it is a camera that is equipped with both video and radar as a detection mechanism. It is solar powered. It can be solar powered or it can be powered with a regular AC or DC connection. It also is LTE capable. So it is fully wireless in all its capabilities. And we are seeing a fairly rapid uptake in that solution because of its ease of install -- it is probably the easiest to install a video camera device out there today. Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks. Thanks. Louie. Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first item I had is, I'm curious, could you talk through the K-12 trends that you've seen as of late, talk to maybe materiality and how some of the COVID relief funding is starting to manifest. Mahesh talked about safety reimagine, but any other types of projects that you're seeing in that space would be helpful. Sure. So I pointed out earlier, but education is -- it's our largest vertical in terms of Video Security & Access Control. There's been 170 million billion allocated to funding school safety. And it continues to outpace -- as much as we grew 24% last year, education continues to even outpace our growth in the overall business.
It's one that school safety is paramount to what everyone is doing. And it's not only video security, it's access control, but it also brings in PCR radios and their ability to interoperate, to provide intelligence in terms of if there's an ingress/egress at a door, there's things that happen. I mean analytics play a huge role in driving a lot of our education success in terms of unusual motion detection, if there's an altercation in a cafeteria, think of things like that. Stadiums things happen with teenage kids in stadiums and those kind of things. So all those things have kind of culminated in a great opportunity.
One of the things we did early days is we actually went out, hired a team to -- all they do is get up and focus every day in the educational space because one of our core beliefs here is we believe domain expertise, market knowledge matters in terms of going back and work with the product group and making sure we're making the right definition. The other thing I'd add, public schools get a lot of attention. But one of the reasons we look at Ava is we actually looked at a lot of private schools who actually wanted a cloud solution. We didn't have a solution before we bought Ava and we've identified opportunities to accelerate growth in the private education system as well there. Okay. That's great. The follow-up is within Command Center, Greg, you spoke to 20% growth in 2023. Jason, I think you said ex Rave low doubles. If you look at Command Center as a percentage of mix, it's been pretty stable, about 7 points of revenue over the last several years. A lot of things going on. Could you talk a little bit about the sales motion there, the complexity of the systems and longer term, when you think that might be a bigger driver to the overall mix or grow as a percentage of the total, if you get a more widespread investment among those customers? That's it. Thank you. Yeah. I mean I think the primary thing I'd point to there is we have -- you have to think about the Command Central market in terms of its very widespread. There are 6,500 public safety answering points in North America. And what you see taking place, and I think where we've talked about is, you've got -- historically, you had three to four different RFP cycles, meaning CAD RMS, you had a 911 system, you had consoles and radio consoles in some respect as well as Aware platform, which is more of a proactive mechanism to look at police.
And what we're seeing, I think, particularly as we start to see newer and probably more technology savvy dispatchers enter the market, they want a unified experience. They want to look at a piece of software that is commonality instead of looking at four different things, operating with multiple different screens, different ways to interface to the technology. So I know that everybody would like this thing just to turn on and everybody go to kind of a Microsoft suite, the reality is, they've made investments. Some of them maybe just bought a new RMS system three years ago. And there's a cycle to that. But we think there's a cycle, and it's a benefit to us.
And I think one of the things that Mahesh and his team have done a great job of is they put us in a position to have a conversation with a customer. It isn't bad for us if they buy those things in three different cycles because they buy from us. As long as they like the experience we deliver, we think there's a margin opportunity there as well. Thanks, Jack. [Technical Difficulty] And just looking at how we performed over 2022, our SaaS growth was actually 2 times that of command center total revenue. And today, about one-third of our command center software customers are actually they have at least 1 cloud-hosted hybrid solution in the mix there. And then we mentioned Greater Harris County as one of the deals this year -- or last quarter. An important element of that solution was -- the smart transcription solution that I mentioned previously and Greater Harris County is actually the largest smart transcription deployment to date. And so we are seeing more adoption of hybrid solutions going into that, and that's growing well for us. Thanks, Mahesh. Thank you. Our last question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. I appreciate that. I hope [indiscernible] last I could ask an awful lot of questions. But on a serious note, Greg, the guidance you'll give in organic terms, what does that translate to stripping out what you're expecting from Rave or any other contemplated acquisitions? And how does that compare to organic growth in 2022? I assume Rave is the only -- or the biggest inorganic piece this year? Yes. It's largely Rave. Last year, inorganic revenues contributed $121 million to our -- and this year, it's largely the Rave of around $70-plus million from Rave. So that's the bridge. You don't have -- in that guidance, you're not putting in anything in terms of prospective acquisitions other than Rave that was disclosed, and it's obviously less, a fair deal less than what acquisitions contributed? It's the business as we see it and have it today. That's right. All right. I appreciate that. And which ties into the next question, your LMR business just grew 9% last year following 7.6% growth the year before and 3.9% a year before that for a business that you historically have characterized understandably, I think it's low single digit. And so it came off a very strong year and had even strong growth.
In terms of -- relative to the mid-single-digit guidance on LMR, I'm trying to understand the upside potential [indiscernible] assume the downside of this is one of the -- I'm trying to understand upside potential. Can you just review -- I know you've touched on it throughout the call, but can you review what were the key drivers in that? You mentioned that PCR was up. I don't think you gave us a number. I assume it was back up to the $1 billion level that you referenced in 2019. I think that was the level. But can you go through the various drivers, APX, PCR, et cetera, that contributed to that awfully strong growth? And what you're expecting going forward? So Paul, I'd say let's start foundationally and thematically. I think it's a statement about the strength and durability of land mobile radio, first and foremost as a platform. LMR versus an LTE or cellular alternative, number one. Number two, we talk a lot about APX NEXT, APX NEXT being the premier high-tier device, most successful product launch MSI has ever had. Where customers are clamoring for it given the feature functionality, the LTE roaming, the over-the-air software efficiency that eliminates or minimizes their operating expense.
And then we're taking APX NEXT, and we're introducing the APX NEXT mid-tier refresh. So you think about more broadly, there's 13,000 LMR networks around the world. You take a subset of that with better North American centric and P25 and you have a whole device portfolio refresh high-end led by APX NEXT, mid-tier then APX NEXT mid-tier. By the way, we're refreshing the TETRA portfolio as well, and we've continued to add and enhance the PCR portfolio.
Then you add the backdrop of ARPA funding and state budgets that are as strong as they've been in years and PCR up [indiscernible] had best quarter it's ever had in and it has returned to prepandemic levels. And to your point, it's back to about $1 billion. And even with the business model change around PCR exiting certain countries in Asia, recognizing margin instead of full top end revenue, we still not expect to grow off of a record 2022.
So you have device portfolio refresh, best-in-class product. This is a need to have, not a nice to have. That's not just a slogan. That's a reality and the demand for LMR [indiscernible] and the platforms and the feature functionality that comes with that, not to mention the integration of the Command Center and things like video security and Access Control are powering this technology forward. Now why mid-single digit? Because I remind you, we're still in a supply-constrained environment. Lead times are still the same as they were a quarter or two ago. if there's relief on that front or that changes throughout the year, we'll inform you. But that's what's driving that guide. Greg, I think you just told us that if supply permits, demand would accommodate more than that mid-single digit, 5% guidance. But my last question, any update with respect to you all being able to collect on that not in substantial Hytera litigation award? Work in progress. By the way, it's worth saying, Paul, that our expectation for cash flow in fiscal 2023 assumes no collection in that year. They owe us about $60 million. We've collected some a relatively de minimis amount. Our trial is the Civil trial. They have a 21 count criminal trial that begins at the DOJ federal level in February of 2024. We've asked the court to hold Hytera in contempt for failing to make a royalty payment.
Look, it's a long slog. It's a multiyear fight against Hytera, but it's the right thing to do. We're going to protect the intellectual property of this firm. We'll see how it plays out. We had, by the way, they're defendant, [indiscernible] and plead guilty in the U.K., that's the senior engineering executive for Hytera that reported to the CEO, he changed his fee several months ago to guilty. So I know it takes long, and the wheels of justice grind relatively slowly, but we'll stay tuned and update you accordingly. But in terms of our forecasting or assumptions for fiscal 2023, there's zero from a cash standpoint. I appreciate that. Guys, can I just clarify one thing going back to 1 more question. Greg, I think you and Jack and Jason have made the point historically previously that the new APX handsets accommodating the richer applications that require the new APX handset in order for your customers to deploy. I trust that's still the case, assuming the fact that there's a strong take-up of APX NEXT bodes well for take-up of the incremental command center software and LMR services, et cetera, and so one goes hand in hand with the other. Well, the fact that the APX NEXT has software applications that are embedded in the capability of the device themselves. That platform is there to upgrade and add apps over time. I appreciate it. Yes, thank you, Paul. All right. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional and closing remarks. Thank you, everybody, and thank for joining the call. I would just summarize by saying what we do has never been more important than it is now. I mean, last year was a truly outstanding year. second consecutive year of double-digit top line revenue growth. We expanded operating margins despite the higher input costs around semiconductors. We acquired seven companies for the deployment and utilization of capital of $1.2 billion.
The demand environment remains exceptionally strong, heading into this year. We've got strong multiyear funding. We've got record orders. We got record backlog. The exciting part is, we're at the intersection of public safety and enterprise security. And the width and breadth of our technology ecosystem, I think, further fortifies our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. I want to thank every single Motorolan that's listening into this call. This is an incredible company with this very strong purpose, passion, reengineering, innovation mentality.
And as we heard yesterday in the supplier conference that Jason referenced and Jack, Mahesh and I participated in, these are special people with a commitment to serve and the commitment to the community. It's above and beyond. I appreciate everybody on the call. Thank you for joining, and we look forward to updating you again in a few months. I appreciate you all.

[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2023 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we referenced non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today’s earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I will turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thank you everybody for joining us today. First, let me start by just saying that Q1 was an exceptional start to the year. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance with revenue up 15% and earnings per share up 31% versus the prior year. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points, and we had record Q1 orders, which led to record Q1 ending backlog of $14.1 billion, up 5% versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX.
Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based, with strong double-digit revenue growth in both segments, all three technologies and in both regions North America and international. Additionally, public safety and enterprise security remains more important than ever, which is driving demand for both our public safety and enterprise customers. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we’re raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year.
I’ll turn the call over to Jason to take you through results and outlook and then be back and return for some final thoughts. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 15% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $45 million, while acquisitions added $42 million. GAAP operating earnings were $399 million or 18.4% of sales, up from 12.6% in the year ago quarter.
Non-GAAP operating earnings were $532 million, up 42% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5%, up 470 basis points. This strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, lower direct material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend in attaining semiconductors and improved operating leverage.
GAAP earnings per share was $1.61 compared to $1.54 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.22, up 31% from $1.70 last year. The strong growth in earnings per share was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q1 was $530 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives in the current year.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was a usage of $8 million and free cash flow was a usage of $62 million. The cash flow in Q1 was in line with our expectations and included a onetime cash tax payment of $70 million related to an IP reorganization we completed last year. It also reflects our strategic decision to carry higher inventories. For the full year, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion, with greater contributions in the second half, consistent with the shape of last year’s cash flow. The capital allocation for Q1 included $148 million in cash dividends, $140 million in share repurchases and $54 million of CapEx.
Moving to our segment results, in the Products and SI segment, sales were up 18% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions flowing through. Currency headwinds were $19 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter added $12 million. Operating earnings were $246 million or 18.9% of sales, up from 8.7% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q1’s achievements in this segment include a $27 million countywide P25 system for Johnson County, Missouri, a $20 million P25 device order for a U.S. state and local customer, a $17 million P25 system for Wakulla County, Florida, a $16 million fixed video contract for a large health care system and a $15 million Apex and Apex Next devices order for the Kansas Highway Patrol.
In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, including 19% growth in Command Center and 20% growth in video. Revenue from acquisitions was $30 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $26 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $286 million, up 3% versus last year and operating margins were 32.9%, down from 35.2% last year on mix, higher costs from acquisitions and FX.
For the full year, we expect operating margins in this segment to be comparable to last year to slightly down, driven by higher costs from acquisitions, primarily rate. Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $340 million federal IDIQ award to combine existing services and provide new LMR services to the U.S. Air Force, which has long been an important customer of ours.
Given the nature of this 10-year agreement, we recorded only $11 million of backlog in the first quarter and expect backlog to be recorded ratably over time for the remainder of the contract. Additionally, we expect new services included it to contribute an incremental $60 million of revenue over the 10-year period when compared to the previous service agreements. We also received a $21 million multiyear support services extension for Portugal’s nationwide Catcher system, a $10 million LMR services agreement with a federal agency and a $9 million fixed video services contract renewal with the City of Chicago.
Looking at regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 14% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $679 million, up 16% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $14.1 billion, up 5% or $623 million versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX. These results were driven by strong demand across all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $280 million, driven primarily by typical order seasonality in North America. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $601 million or 15% driven primarily by strong LMR demand. Sequentially, backlog was down $186 million due to North America orders seasonality following a record backlog in Q4.
In Software and Services, backlog was up $22 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by the revenue recognition for Airwave along with $329 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to the exit of ESN contract that we announced last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $94 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 10% to 11% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.49 and $2.54 per share. This assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, up from our prior range of $9.65 billion to $9.7 billion and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.21 and $11.29, up from our prior guidance of $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. As I mentioned on the last call, the increase from our 20.1% tax rate last year is due to lower tax benefits on share comp and a higher UK tax rate in the current year, both of which combined represent an approximately $0.50 headwind in our full year earnings per share guide.
The increased outlook for the full year is a reflection of the continued strength of our business and demand for our solutions. The revenue guidance reflects expectations for strong double-digit growth in the first half as well as continued growth in the second half of the year, which comes on top of the 15% growth we saw in the second half of last year.
I’ll now turn the call back to Greg. Thanks, Jason. Let me just end with a few thoughts. First and foremost, our business remains very strong. We had record Q1 orders and achieved revenue above our expectations. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever, and our public safety and enterprise customers are continuing to prioritize our solutions to help communities safe, which is driving our increased top and bottom line guidance for the full year.
Second, I want to highlight two recent announcements in our Video Security business. First, we made the decision to integrate our end-to-end fixed video portfolio, consolidating the majority of our fixed video solutions under two platforms: Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. Alta is our cloud-native security suite, consolidating Openpath, and Ava Security, while Unity is our on-prem security suite, consolidating Avigilon and Indigo vision. This help streamline our go-to-market channels and further reinforces our vertical focus, particularly in government, but also education and healthcare, which combine those three now represent half of our video security revenues.
Additionally, in our mobile video business, we launched our new V700-body-worn camera. The V700 is our first body-worn camera to provide broadband connectivity that facilitates integration with our market-leading in-car video solution, our Apex radios and our command center software, including live video streaming and location tracking through our aware product.
And finally, our strong start to the year underlines the strength and resiliency of our business. The demand for our products and solutions that keep communities safe remains exceptionally strong. Our continued focus on cost management and inventory optimization, coupled with our previous modest pricing actions that we took earlier continues to drive margin expansion and our strong balance sheet and durable cash flows allow us to be opportunistic with the deployment of capital going forward to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I’ll now turn it over to Tim and open it up for your questions. Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Thank you. Yes, two, if I could here. First, just looking at the second half, I know, Jason, you mentioned tough comps, but hoping you could just give a little commentary around moving parts given those pricing benefits and pretty healthy backlog still. So what are the moving parts in that second half? And then second, more specifically on video, Greg or Jack, if you could talk a little bit about, it was good to see above the full year growth rate in Q1. Could you talk a little bit about where we are with cross-sell opportunities and also opportunities in video from NDAA and RPS safe schools and things like that? Thank you. Sure, Tim. So on the second half, so you’ll recall that last year in the second half is when the pricing actions that we implemented really began to show up in the P&L, and those really helped last year’s growth and profitability expansion in the second half. So our position today, as we look at those 15% comps is that we’re still in a supply-constrained environment. We have lead times from our suppliers. We have expectations to grow and with opportunities ahead of us for the second half with the continued demand that we have. Where the pricing actions benefited us particularly in Q1 and expect similar for Q2 is last year’s comps in the first half did not include those same pricing actions. So as we start to enter July, we’re anniversary-ing those pricing actions and still expect growth on top of those. And Tim, specific to cross-sell, what I would do is highlight four specific verticals, starting with government. As we have attested to before, Government was a nascent business when we acquired Avigilon, we made subsequent acquisitions. But just to put it in context, we’ve kind of put the marker out there this year for a video security business that we would grow approximately 15%. We expect government to grow in the high teens. And we think we’ve got opportunities to move that. Specifically, I’d also call out healthcare, we’re really, really pleased. We won – we secured a $16 million deal with the large-scale hospital system. This was an add-on. And the beauty of that is they’re not only a video user, but they’re also a radio user. Education has been we’ve attested to the fact that numerous school systems are upgrading. Some are going with Avigilon Unity on prime systems, large-scale urban schools. But what we’re really seeing is acceleration of growth in the cloud there and the ability to do radio alert and integrate access control, LMR, our command center software product called Compass into school systems is a game changer.
And then lastly is the industrial space, namely utilities. We’ve talked about the fact we’ve secured a large-scale utility in the past. We’ve done in the area of $50 million of utility. And I think as utilities start to fortify their power grids and their substations will have incremental cross-sell opportunities there, Tim. But I think the highlight is we tie it all into making sure that we incent our sales force to go and cross-sell, and that’s just part of the DNA now. Okay, thank you very much. The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I think you guys mentioned ARPA in the last question or maybe Tim did, but what are your expectations for the ARPA benefit this year? I know that you’ve got about $400 million in orders from ARPA related projects last year, I would imagine some of that converted to revenue last year. But what do you think that might look like for 2023? Any sense? Thanks. Yes. So George, I would say ARPA, anytime there’s federal stimulus dollars are conducive, and I would say, beneficial to the business. But to kind of put it in context, it’s approximately 5% of our orders in North America last year. And that’s not to diminish it, but I would take it to a higher level. I’ve actually gone and looked in Salesforce. It’s – they’ve contributed to deals that were secured, but they for the sole purpose of deals that were secured. I think at the end of the day, when you think about mission-critical communications or even a school, we think we’re in an area of prioritization in areas as we’ve said before, it’s a need to have, not a nice to have. So I think it’s generally conducive, but it’s – I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s the largest attributor to our success. Got it. Great. And then just as a quick follow-on. I think the question everyone’s been asking is on supply chain, many companies, I think, are going through inventory corrections now. I mean any sense that your customers have been inventoring products or is there any risk of supply chain corrections or inventory corrections for you guys as you look forward? Thanks. The demand from our customers remains very strong. Our backlog position is at a record level. And that includes backlog that customers are having to wait a bit longer than they’d like and we’re working through those delays in getting them products. With the results in Q1, we were able to attain a little bit better supply. We had a good quarter across LMR, Public Safety, had a good quarter with PCR. So we’re getting after this backlog position and fulfilling the customers demands, both the demand they placed on us in backlog is also the demand they place on us within the quarter. So – and our inventory position, if I shift to our balance sheet, has helped us mitigate a choppy supply environment, and we continue to be mindful of inventory and its utility in serving what remains a challenging supply environment. It’s been a helpful tool. And we do have expectations for inventory to reduce in the second half. That’s in our cash flow expectations, but it remains an important tool to navigate this environment. Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. And maybe just a question on the APX NEXT, you had mentioned that being targeted towards the high end and then introducing kind of the mid-tier product. I just wanted to get a sense of adoption trends of the various pieces of the portfolio and were they kind of following the customer adoption types that you expected? And then just maybe an update on Rave integration would be helpful. Thanks. Sure, Meta. Maybe I will start with the APX NEXT, and Mahesh will speak to Rave. First of all, we are in the early innings, as we have said before. And I think it’s most important to point out that it’s a multiyear introduction for the APX NEXT. What typically happens is we have – we run the APX original and the APX NEXT line in tandem for the foreseeable future. In fact, to point that out 80% in Q1 of our device revenue was actually APX original. So, we have got a coexist and strong pipeline for both of them. We have got $410 million orders since we introduced the APX NEXT. But we have just recently, last fall, introduced the N-Series radio, which starts to fill in the portfolio and now we are bringing out international P25 units to bear that will be targeted in Australia, New Zealand and Israel. All-in, with the new product, what we are seeing is kind of high-single digit ASP increases as well. And I would also mention other parts of the portfolio, TETRA, PCR are areas where we have focused and have exciting products coming to market and receptive customers to those as well. So, we are at an important point in the targeted investments we made in and through COVID that are now producing those exciting products are also an important part of our growth drivers. And on Rave, Rave has exceeded our initial expectations for performance. We see strong traction in education, especially higher ed, but also K-12. And as we previously talked about, Rave bridges enterprise security with public safety and with some of the initiatives that we have undertaken recently, we are making the bridge wider effectively allowing for more data and at a faster rate to go from enterprise security to public safety. So, two specific examples worth mentioning there, first, with every one of our new VESTA 911 orders, we are actually bundling Rave 911 suite. And what that includes is two-way texting, caller profile. This is information about individuals who perhaps need special assistance, facility info, which is blueprints a facility so that responders can respond with greater information as to what to see – what they will see when they get to the facility and very importantly, caller location. And that is going to be part of our Rave VESTA 911 offer going forward. The second is we are integrating more closely with our enterprise security solution. So, Orchestrate is a key enabler for that. And as part of our full Safety Reimagined program, we are bringing Rave much closer in terms of the ability to detect and the ability to alert using Rave alert and the ability to bridge into 911 as appropriate. So, those two together is really augmenting our path forward in terms of taking advantage of our strength in education, along with our presence with PSAPs. Great. Thanks. The next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Alright. Thank you. I had a couple of questions, some of the modeling, some of the business dynamics. I will start with business dynamics first. So, one on the backlog, so there obviously are a lot of big deals. And maybe you could give us a characterization of how many of these bigger deals are expected? And then maybe taking that question a step further is if we excluded FX impact and excluded big episodic activity, are you still seeing the backlog step up, right, with more of these – your standard business motion? And then I have a follow-up. Sami, I think I would address your inquiry. We have seen strong demand not only big deals, but also the usual type and profile of our business. And I would point to duration. While our backlog is up and at record levels, the duration of our backlog is similar to slightly better than it was last year and it was last quarter. So, not only are we growing backlog, the opportunities we have to convert that backlog within the year are slightly better. So, that’s one of the reasons that, again, with our expectations going up for the year, it’s driven by that backlog position. And backlog is up in the unfavorable FX to your other point of $370 million. By the way, the other thing, Sami, is even when we have a large product, much like the Air Force we talked about earlier on the call, it’s a $340 million 10-year order, only $11 million of that is logged in backlog. So, I like the composition and the duration of the backlog in addition to it being absolute and at record levels as we exit Q1. Got it. Thank you for that. Also, Greg, Jason, if you guys could give us any kind of idea on all video revenue growth targets for 2023. And also, we appreciate the new breakout of the Avigilon segment. So, our expectations for total video remain approximately 15%. That’s consistent with our last call. And as Jack mentioned, that growth will be even better in some of our power verticals, which represent over half of the composition of the revenue. So, video is performing to our expectations. And then Sami, to your observation of Greg’s comments around our portfolio around Alta and Unity, that’s a market-facing change that we will represent the brands and Jack’s sales team is positioned to sell video. We are in a great position to sell it either in an on-prem version, which is the way most customers buy today, but also in a cloud version. And as markets move, we are positioned extremely well. Yes. I think a great example. I got a phone call yesterday, Sami, on that specific to a large-scale metropolitan school district. They had three finalists, two of the finalists were Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. And I think that’s the power that we can meet a customer for their specific needs that no one else in the marketplace has today. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional comments or closing remarks. Sure. Thank you. Look, I would just say in closing, it was a great Q1, and I think it highlights the fact that what we do has never been more important. Both the demand environment and execution is strong. I am really proud of the people. I am really proud of our channel partners that achieved record Q1 orders, record Q1 backlog. Look, at the end of the day, as we exit Q1, I like our position. More importantly, I like our momentum. And then, again, this is despite the ongoing supply chain challenges that still have to sort of sell-through for the next several quarters. The fact is the intersection, as Mahesh talked about, of public safety and enterprise security, it’s critical. And we are building a safety and security technology ecosystem that connects public safety with private institutions, as you heard Jack reference in those key verticals. I couldn’t be more proud of this team. And I am optimistic and enthusiastic about the opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining, and I look forward to connecting up with you a quarter from now. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within three hours after the conclusion of this call.
The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today’s presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2023 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.
We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today’s earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with revenue and earnings per share both exceeding our guidance. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13% and operating earnings were up 15%, driven by strong growth across all three technologies. And in Products and Systems Integration, continued robust demand and improved supply chain availability led to a 12% growth in revenue and a 52% growth in operating earnings in the segment.
Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up approximately $850 million versus last year, and also up approximately $200 million sequentially. Second, our exceptional performance during the quarter was broad-based, with double-digit revenue growth in both segments both regions and in all three technologies, including 20% growth in Command Center and 17% growth in Video Security.
We also saw record Q2 orders in both segments during the quarter, driven by customers prioritizing technology investments to strengthen public safety and enterprise security. And finally, based on our Q2 results and the continued strong demand we’re seeing across the business, we’re again raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.
I’ll now turn the call over to Jason. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 12% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $23 million, while acquisitions added $20 million. GAAP operating earnings were $518 million or 21.6% of sales, up from 16.7% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $641 million, up 29% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 350 basis points.
The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, inclusive of our higher prices, pricing, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $2.15 compared to $1.33 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, up 28% from $2.07 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q2 was $555 million, up $53 million versus last year, primarily due to increased expenses from acquisitions, investments in video and higher employee-related incentives in the current year.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $93 million, up $83 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $40 million, up $89 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. The linearity of our cash flow is expected to be consistent with last year with higher earnings and improved working capital driving increased cash flow in the second half.
Also, as we previously highlighted, this year’s cash flow includes approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $70 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization that we did in 2022. Capital allocation in Q2 included $224 million in share repurchases, $148 million in cash dividends and $53 million of CapEx.
Moving to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 12% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions continuing to flow through. Currency headwinds were $10 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $2 million. Operating earnings were $285 million or 19.8% of sales, up from 14.6% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend for semiconductors and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include $145 million P25 system upgrade for Kern County, California. A $41 million P25 system and device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $31 million P25 system expansion for Ventura County, California, a $19 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer and a $6 million fixed video order for a large U.S. healthcare customer.
In Software and Services, revenue was up 13%, including 20% growth in Command Center and 19% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $13 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $356 million, up 15% versus last year and operating margins were 36.9%, up from 36.1% last year. On higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher costs from acquisitions.
Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $34 million video order for the Virginia State Police, which included our largest in-car video order ever, a $15 million LMR services agreement with City of Baltimore, Maryland, a $13 million managed services agreement for LMR and a renewal in Latin America; a $12 million Command Center order for a U.S. federal customer and an $8 million LMR service agreement with another U.S. federal customer.
Looking at regional results for the company, North America Q2 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 11% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $762 million, up 16% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video, partially offset by unfavorable FX.
Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $856 million versus last year, driven by strong demand in all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $211 million, driven by record Q2 orders in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $496 million or 11% and year-over-year and up $100 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR demand. In Software and Services, backlog was up $360 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and the adjustment related to the ESN contract exit. Sequentially, backlog was up $111 million, driven by record Q2 orders in the segment.
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.99 and $3.04 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, up from our prior range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.40 and $11.48 per share up from our prior guidance of $11.21 to $11.29 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.
Before turning it back to Greg, I wanted to provide some color on a few financial topics. First, an update on the CMA and Airwave. As we’ve stated previously, we strongly disagree with the CMA’s final decision. Earlier this week, the CMA issued its remedies order regarding implementation of their final decision effective on August 1. This procedural next step does not change our position regarding the ongoing appeal process and our strong belief in our case. However, from an accounting perspective, beginning August 1, we will now defer revenue for the amount above the remedies order price control until the appeals process has been completed. This deferral and resulting lower revenue from Airwave for the remainder of the year is fully incorporated into our increased revenue and earnings guidance for the year.
Second, earlier this week, Moody’s upgraded our credit from two Baa2 from Baa3. This higher credit rating underscores the strength of our balance sheet, including the strong liquidity position, our balanced debt maturity profile, significantly improved pension status, along with a track record of consistently growing earnings and cash flow.
And finally, our increased guidance for the year highlights the strength of our business as we enter the second half. Our backlog is exceptionally strong, driven by robust customer demand. And based on our current pipeline and supply chain environment, we expect backlog to remain strong going forward. Additionally, the expected lower semiconductors we articulated in February, the cost related to these semiconductors coupled with the pricing adjustments in our own portfolio that were implemented in the second half of last year are driving the significant full year margin expansion of approximately 175 basis points. That is implied in our increased guidance.
I’m now turning the call back to Greg. Jason, thank you very much. First, our exceptional Q2 results highlight the continued strong momentum we’re seeing across the business. We grew revenue double-digits in both segments, both regions, and in all three technologies. We expanded operating margins by 350 basis points, and we achieved record Q2 orders, which has led to our highest ending backlog ever for a second quarter, and is driving our increased guidance for the full year.
Second, we continue to leverage our global installed base to sell more value-add Software and Services to our customers. During the quarter, Software and Services revenue was up 13% with strong growth in all three technologies. We also achieved record Q2 orders in this segment, highlighted by our largest in-car video order ever from the Virginia State Police that included automated license plate recognition and digital evidence management. And with our recent Rave acquisition, we’ve made significant advances in integration across our ecosystem, which is driving strong pipeline demand for Rave together with our command center products.
And finally, I just wanted to spend a little time and provide some color on artificial intelligence. We recognized AI and the potential impact it could have on our customers back a few years ago when we acquired Avigilon and its AI capabilities. And we’ve seen and continue to see this technology driving opportunity for both our business and our customers.
AI along with generative AI plays an important role in our solutions to help keep communities safe from actively analyzing live video and alerting humans when something important happens to assisting a 911 call with our live translation solution to automatically redacting evidence, these advancements improve response times, which can help save lives while also enhancing privacy for those involved.
AI will continue to enhance how our solutions help protect people, property, and places. With our ongoing investments and deep expertise, we’re very well-positioned in this space, and we expect to see increased adoption of these technologies from public safety, enterprises, and private organizations alike for a more proactive approach to safety and security.
I’ll now turn the call back to Tim and we’ll open it up for your questions. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I’d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Thank you. I’ll start with the clarification, Jason, one for you, Greg. Jason, yes, pretty impressive, you’re raising numbers despite the change in accounting for Airwave. Just wanted to clarify there we got the new revenue level that was mandated and that you guys are accounting to. Can you just talk a little bit about expenses? I think you guys have run that network pretty efficiently.
So should we assume a comparable expense level to how things have been running? Or is does something change on that side on the EPS impact? And then for Greg, if you could just talk a little bit about macro, it sounds like everything’s going pretty well, but if you could just hit on kind of what you’re seeing from the government customers and to what extent you’re starting to see federal and ARPA type of dollars flowing into the business. That’d be great. Thank you. Thanks, Tim. So our expectations for Airwave revenues this year with the now deferred revenue effective August 1 are for about $480 million of revenue from Airwave. That’ll be down from about $560 million last year. To answer your question on cost, we run that network and provide a service level. I wouldn’t anticipate significant cost changes. Our cost to run that network and deliver the services are what they are. So we are deferring about $80 million in revenue this year and still raising our guidance from the last time we were together by about $140 million. And to Jason’s point, the $80 million reduction due to accounting and the required treatment of that from $560 million to $480 million is obviously all in the back half of the year starting August 1, running through the remainder of the year. As in terms of expenses and investment, we continue to invest in Airwave by the way, Tim just a few months ago the end users gave us feedback and network performance and reliability, which was as high as we’ve ever achieved on Airwave.
So we’re proud of that and we continue to maintain and invest on behalf of our end users. In terms of macro, high level the business is as good as I’ve ever seen it. The demand drivers are strong. Jack has talked about, and we’ll talk a little bit about today if you want about device refresh. And interestingly, Tim, Molloy mentioned last year, we try to track demand against the orders achieved last year, and we believe as best we could tell less than 5% of our orders last year were tagged due to ARPA.
Through the first half of this year, we also believe it’s less than 5% as well. So the nice thing about this is, we’re seeing demand drivers around public safety, video security, access control, command center, software and services that’s really underpinning environmental and overall demand sure ARPA helps, but as best we could tell, it’s fairly minimal. I’d agree with that, Greg. The only thing I’d add to that, and I think you highlighted the benefits from a product standpoint, but from S&S standpoint, a year-over-year, we had a $360 million increase in backlog.
In addition to that, we’re in receipt of a contract from the State of Illinois for a $300 million frame agreement for a 10-year period for services. That’s incremental and that’s not reflected in our backlog, Tim. So I think that’s just another proof point to the conversations we’re having with customers really resonate for their needs right now. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thanks, Tim. And our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi guys, thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about margins and profitability. I think at one point you guys were looking for about a $50 million benefit this year on lower brokers fees and expedite fees. I guess I’m wondering if that’s still the expectation for this year. And then also I’m curious about what the overall level of broker fees and expedite fees you’re carrying for this year would look like. And when do those step back down? Would that be a 2024 event or when do you see relief there? Thanks. Hi George, thanks for the question. So we began the year with an expectation for $50 million of lower costs related to premiums through brokers. We’re trending a bit better than that. We’re on path to about a $60 million year-over-year benefit largely in the first half. We’re still spending some investments on brokers.
As we look into next year, we would expect to comparable benefit level of about $60 million into 2024 for brokers. Again, the supply chain environment remains fluid. It’s incrementally better, but we’re still using the same tools we’ve been using for over a year to make sure that we get the supplies that we need. The level of commitment from our suppliers is strong but their lead times remain elevated still. And so from time to time we will use PPV [ph] to secure the parts to match the record demand that we’re seeing. And I do have to say thanks to for all the engineers in Motorola, because as we manage PPV and to Jason’s point, we’ll achieve now $60 million, a little higher than $50 million’s target. And we – that would be our goal for next year as well another $60 million. A lot of the engineers in Motorola have done real time under Molloy’s leadership and Scott Mottonen and others. They’ve done product redesign in a way that’s allowed us to substitute parts in a matter of months that also have allowed the company to be adept and firm and responsive to our customers. And I just want everybody to know on the engineering community how grateful we are for that because they were – they’ve been superstars. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, if I do the math, I think you’re still caring about $150 million in annualized expedite fees or brokers fees. Is that right for this year? Yes. This year’s envelope is going to be a little less than that. It’s more important that we – as we look at next year’s envelope reducing by $60 million, that’s our current thinking. As we go through supply planning, there’s other offsets that are always in the mix around direct materials costs, some positive, some unfavorable. So as we look to next year, we see a $60 million benefit, particularly related to this opportunity from broker fees. Great. Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Thanks, George. We’ll take our next question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start on Airwave. Just a clarification, admittedly, I think we’re all outside our core competency and trying to read through these legal documents here, but $200 million in U.S. dollars. So I guess the first question would be just to understand how you came up with that $80 million headwind? And then secondly, what absent the appeal? What that number would go to in 2024 as we try to think about shaping our models for the worst case scenario? Yes. So first of all, the beginning date of the deferral for revenue is consistent with the remedies order, which is August 1 to the end of the year. That’s the approximately $80 million. If you do the math on that for next year it would – it’d be approximately another $100 million step down. There are a variety of inputs that go into us servicing Airwave, the usage of the network, the one-time events that go with the network, the number of user communities that subscribe as well as inflation and other variables that go into how much revenue we recognize from the contract.
All those things together last year $560 million, this year on path to $480 million and then you can do the math on the price control into next year for approximately another $100 million decline. For the full year, yes. For the full year, correct. And Adam, what I’d say is like I think this process is proceeding as expected. So we knew that the CMA issued a final decision. In Q2, we knew it would be followed by a remedies order statutorily, they could have gone till October to do that as late as October. They did it now in light of the remedies implementation order, that requires the accounting treatment Jason just described. It doesn’t change at all our belief and our confidence in this case, by the way. The hearing, the appeal to the competition appeals tribunal was yesterday and today.
So that part is done as well. Now we will wait to see what they rule on the appeal. We have said and I’ve said we’ve been very consistent. We think this action is unprecedented overreaching. It effectively is opening up an already agreed on binding legal contract. But we’ll see how it plays out, in the meantime, we’ve deferred the revenue through the end of this year as required and to articulate and quantify what it could be. If nothing else changed, it would be another approximately $100 million deferral or reduction of Airwave on a full year basis next year. Okay. And that $100 million on revenue, would that also be about approximately that on the EBIT line or any way to think for us to think about EBIT on that a $100 million? Yes, so as I mentioned to Tim, the cost structure and our needs to run this network haven’t changed. So the lower revenue largely tracks to a lower a margin amount as well. Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then absent that, obviously Greg, as you mentioned, the rest of the business is running in incredibly well. Notably, the PSI segment over 50% operating income growth on 12% revenue growth and I’m looking at a first half margin near 20%, which is I think maybe even unprecedented for that segment in total for the first half. So I guess a question on that would be how do you see the margin trajectory of that piece of the business? I know it’s been through a lot whether it was COVID and pandemic and all that. I wonder if you’re coming out the other side with maybe a structurally improved margin profile and how you’re thinking about the trajectory of that piece of business. Thanks. First of all, I’d say that, and again, I compliment the team, Jason, Jack, on the improved gross margins, both on cost of goods as well as – as you know, we’ve taken a series of pricing actions starting last year and coming into this year. We view those pricing actions as sticky, not transient. So the margin profiles better. In terms of growth of LMR and the technology, we’ve guided for the full year mid-single-digits, we still expect that to be appropriate full year guidance. We’re coming off some monster comps in the first half of this year.
And by the way, the Airwave accounting treatment of the $80 million reduction or deferral in revenue is in the back half of this year, that would be reflected in the LMR technology. Having said that, I’m super proud of the gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion and while obviously we’re sitting in August, so it’s too early to talk about 2024, but it would be my and our expectations to grow operating margins in 2024 as well. So it’s important to note also in terms of the first half performance, and you’re right, we had significant margin expansion in products. That’s off of last year’s first half, which included our highest broker costs as well as last year’s first half didn’t include our own pricing increases. So effective July 1 of last year in our second half, you saw significant on good growth, significant margin step up in the second half. That’s continued through the first half of this year. And as we look to growth in our second half this year, we’ll still have margin increases over those records from last year. And really that’s a function of when we implemented the price increases and when the PPV or higher broker costs have come out of our product set. Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. And we’ll move next to Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Thanks. I appreciate you guys taking the question. Greg, I was hoping you could – you made the comment about the overall funding environment being so healthy. And I’m not trying to get you to guide into 2024, but I’m interested how you think about just public sector funding overall, the sources of income to public sector and how you think that’s evolving as you look out over into 2024 and beyond. Well, I like number one to your point, Ben, thanks for the question. The underlying demand drivers of the business are strong absent funding. Then you get the funding and I talked about the, as best we can tell, the percentage orders in terms of order volume attributed to ARPA is 5% or less. The other thing I like is the multi-year nature of state and local funding, which is $350 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act and $170 billion of education, which is an absolutely prioritized vertical for us and what Jack Molloy and his team are doing. So we’re not going to guide on 2024, but the fact that we had the print we had and record Q2 orders and record Q2 ending backlog and improved 12-month duration of backlog. And the other thing Molloy and I track is pipeline, right?
So what’s the pipeline and funnel? What’s the stuff coming in at the top? How are we doing on order conversion and velocity? And when Jack and I look at that, that’s favorable as well. And in terms of the health of the overall state and local budgets, they remain strong too. Thank you, Greg. And I think what I would say there is when we think about top of the pipeline being quoting, bottom of the pipeline being orders, and then the most important metric is the velocity between those two. The our velocity remains consistent. In fact, it’s improved and we’ve seen a growing number of quoting. So I think that portends well to 2024. The other thing that I think is lost in a lot of people when we think about government funding, we’ve talked about ARPA. But when you think about personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax, those three funding streams have all been the beneficiary for government from inflation. So inflation for them means they get more tax receipts in. And their costs haven’t necessarily gone in parallel. And I think a lot of people don’t necessarily understand that, but I just wanted to mention that. So all things in, I think the funding environment and government remains very strong. That’s helpful. I appreciate that. And then Jack, I was hoping you could take us through how you see K-12 developing. If you could speak to the significance of the deal sizes themselves, the nature of the project that you’re seeing, just any thoughts there would be helpful. And that’s it for me. Thank you. So, well, K-12 is – there’s really two technologies. It’s video security and access control. And depending on the type of school district, we’ve seen an acceleration into our Alta, Avigilon Alta, which is cloud, but we’ve also got larger school districts that continue to buy Unity. But the K-12 education in general, we put the marker in that our video business is growing 15% K-12 and the EDU market is, is surpassing that growth level. It did last year, and it continues to grow through the first half of this year very robustly. And I think some of that’s the beneficiary of ARPA funding, but I think a lot of it is really much more – it’s much more secular around school security and that it’s getting prioritized over everything else. One more thing maybe to add to that is just from a safety reimagine standpoint, we’re also integrating Rave along with Orchestrate and Rave. We now have integrations going into aware with a panic button. We also have the capacity to integrate weapons detection. We also launched weapons detection for the school’s market. So all in all, we have other headwinds come – tailwinds coming with us there to push the whole story from a school security standpoint. Good point, Mahesh. Thanks, Ben. We’ll take our next question from Joseph Cardoso with J.P. Morgan. Your light is open. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just one for me. And maybe this is just kind of a broader picture question. The God embeds sort of a normal seasonality in the back half, at least relative to pre-COVID era. However, at the same time you guys are staring at a much larger backlog now, can you just walk us through the puts and takes around that why you’re not seeing better seasonal trends as we kind of go through the back half and I guess particularly just given that you’re seeing better supply headwinds – or sorry, seeing supply handlings ease more broadly, just curious whatever thoughts you have on that. Thank you. Yes. Joseph, just – I’m sure Jason will jump in as well, but I remind you that, you’re right. Normally, this business is typically Q3 and Q4 weighted and seasonally dense. I think that’s unchanged. But remember, we’re guiding an increase in top and bottom, even with the $80 million of Airwave deferral in the back half and another $50 million of PCR light business model change. Jason can elaborate on that. So that’s $130 million of revenue growth that needs to be incorporated into the second half guide, but still informs and allows us to raise. And on the bottom EPS line we have an incremental $0.30 tax headwind, $0.50 for the year. We had $0.20 headwind, first half $0.30 of EPS structural tax headwind back half. So as you incorporate those ingredients into the blender, it shouldn’t take away or distract at all that the demand is strong, the raise is strong and the momentum is strong. So business model change in low end PCR we mentioned in February, we’ve gone to a model where we only recognized the margin and the revenue in the product, no longer the COGS. So it’s OE neutral, but did change the revenue line. That was a way to focus our business on higher value efforts. So that’s something… And the choice, we… Choice we did in February and it’s working out quite well. The other thing I’d point you to is the lead times from our key semiconductor manufacturers and the commitments they give us for getting us the products and the semiconductors we need, support the increased guide and continue to represent opportunity for us as we go forward. But we get commitments from them and we plan the business and how much revenue we can unlock out of backlog based on that. Yes. Got it. Thanks. Appreciate all the color there. Thank you Joseph. Next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Good afternoon guys and great results and impressive guide. Greg, as we look at your software and services margin sitting almost 37% this quarter. I guess the question is, is like, where can those margins go to and maybe some color on the incremental margins for every buck of business brought in? Can help us kind of clear the picture? Well, we had previously said, Keith, thanks for the question that on the full year, we thought we could achieve comparable margins. We had great S&S performance in Q2 and we thought we could have for the full year, as we told you a quarter ago, comparable maybe slightly down, but I thought we were shooting for comparable operating margins in light of the required accounting treatment on Airwave and the decrement of $80 million starting August 1. That falls obviously to SNS and the requisite profitability that Jason articulated.
So I’ve now and we now expect S&S operating margins accounting for that deferral to be down on an operating margin year-over-year basis. In terms of next year, it’s too early to, to guide for that. And we have to see ultimately what’s decided with the Competition Appeal Tribunal appeal and what the disposition of Airwave is from a financial perspective.
That said, we continue to make improvements on synergies and platforming S&S, maybe Mahesh could talk a little bit about that. We’re doing some successful orchestration and integration to get the software sleeves more integrated and working a little bit more seamlessly and a little bit more efficiently. So there’s opportunity, Keith, but it would be premature to quantify at this time. All right, I appreciate that. Across our platform… I’m sorry, go ahead Mahesh. So across our platforms whether that’s cloud or on-prem we are exercising greater synergies in terms of core technology stack. We are optimizing some of our cloud delivery capabilities and really focusing a lot on ease of install as well, so all of that translates to hopefully a good game for us. Got you. Thank you. And then coming back to the CMA ruling and the appeals process, I guess, Greg, what’s the next steps, assuming that you guys lose on appeal? Can you provide perhaps a rough timeline about how this plays out here over the next year or two? Well, in terms of the appeal, it would be our expectation that the CAT rules on the appeal by the end of Q3. I don’t really want to get into hypotheticals on if this, then, that, but we have been consistent, Keith, that said, we will exercise all legal avenues available to us. So the next step after the CAT, if the CAT rules against us would be us taking to this to the UK Court of Appeals. And that would be after the CAT ruling. I don’t know the timeline of what they would do.
What happens there is they have to decide up or down whether they would actually hear the case. I don’t know the timeline that they have available to them in terms of the window to decide. So this will go on a few more months and hopefully we can give you more clarity on the next earnings call. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Keith. [Operator Instructions] We’ll move next to Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Just a couple questions for me. First, obviously the backlog continues to grow. I guess, I just want to make sure is there anything that we should be mindful of a peak quarter for product just in terms of as the supply chain clears and less forward orders? Or is this just really a result of kind of strength of multi-year orders, maybe as the first question. And then as a second question, just traction on kind of bringing APX NEXT into the mid-market or just kind of adoption trends that you’re seeing there? Thanks. Our expectation for backlog and specifically product backlog is for it to remain strong through the duration of the year. That’s a function of our expectations for continued strong inbound orders, as well as the amount of backlog that we can unlock with the available componentry that we need. And related to APX NEXT, Meta, we are now – we had a very strong quarter of new orders. In terms of Q2, we received another $80 million now bringing it close to a half of $500 million in APX NEXT. And when I look at the complexion of those orders, it’s not just big cities, but it’s starting to hit into the Tier 2 cities as well. So we’re really pleased with the performance of that product line. Great. Thanks. Thanks, Meta. Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon. Louie, how are you? Doing excellent. Thank you. As it relates to the LMR device refresh last quarter you discussed how 80% of LMR radio orders were for your older APX radio, despite how APX NEXT has had the strongest demand of any new radio that you have ever introduced and how it was introduced way back in October 19. Why are so many customers still adopting the older APX platform and does this instill confidence that the upgrade cycle for APX NEXT will still potentially be in full effect even a decade from now? So just a couple points. The first of which is think about the government’s procurement cycle, which is one to say it’s long cycle, it’s long years. We did not announce the mid-tier APX NEXT until Q3, late Q3 of 2022. So Louie, what that’s really a function of a byproduct of when it was announced, what was actually able to be quoted at that point in time. But without question, we’re seeing acceleration to the numbers, $80 million in a quarter on the new orders, the type and the striation of customers that are buying those devices.
So the other piece of it, just historically speaking, having worked here long enough to see probably three pretty large scale device refreshes, it typically takes three years – three to five years post-launch to start to alleviate and move those legacy versions down and through the cycle. Great. And it seems that The House committee has approved a $15 billion next-generation 911 funding bill. And on this topic, what is the status of the integration of Rave Wireless with your VESTA solution? And has the adoption of Rave accelerated as a result of the combination with Motorola? Have you juiced up Rave’s ability to generate orders from the education vertical and enterprise vertical? Absolutely. So we – as of last quarter, we are now bundling the Rave 911 suite along with our VESTA, new VESTA sales. So it comes part of that as a whole. In addition to that we have been actively working on just – Rave, remember, is an important bridge for us from enterprise security to public safety. And we’re adding more and more lanes to that bridge with every integration that we do here. The VESTA integration is definitely one of those.
I mentioned the panic button integration with aware being another one. We’re integrating Rave into Orchestrate, which now ties that in with the video and access control pieces as well. So together Rave now plugs into public safety more effectively. And then Rave and aware together actually allows us to connect different instances of CAD as well. So dispatchers instances can communicate with each other as well. So as you look at the install base that we have in VESTA, as you look at the install base that we have in schools, K-12 schools with video and access control, we’re leveraging all of that by bringing that together as this bridge between public safety and enterprise security gets wider. Great. Thanks, Mahesh. And lastly for me, do you have any thoughts on the reported TETRA cybersecurity vulnerabilities? Sure. So I think the first thing is Etsy is the primary spokesman in custodian for the TETRA standard in conjunction with the critical communications authority in Europe. What was reported, I think the first thing I’d like to point out is what was reported is there was no weaknesses found in the public safety algorithms. There’s three algorithms. Tier 1, TEA1 is actually for general use. It’s a little bit more open due to export control issues. But there’s been no exploitation of operational networks that we know of. And essentially subsequent to those findings, which we knew about even into late last year there’s been software patches and then upgrades to the algorithms that have been done subsequent to that. So this was actually paid, this was a research tank done out of the Netherlands who actually did the testing. So yes, something we knew about we had a – the primary weakness was in general use, and I think it’s been remediated since then. Great. So it’s been resolved already. Thanks. Yes. In our view, yes. Thanks, Louie. Thanks. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us, but just in closing, I want to make sure I thank all the employees and the people in Motorola Solutions worldwide and all of our channel partners worldwide. I’m proud of you and we’re proud of you, most especially what you do, how you do it, and the execution.
I said in the call, you heard from Jason and Mahesh and Jack, this business is performing as well as I’ve ever seen it. Demand is strong. It’s strong for what we do, public safety, enterprise security. And I like what we’re doing to meet that demand and exceed that demand with the execution of what we do and what we’re doing on the portfolio reinvention and device refresh. We talk a lot about APX NEXT and all the great work done there, but there’s also great work being done on video security and access control that Mahesh is doing around 911 command center.
And while we’re doing that and running the business and lowering PPV costs and incrementally improving supply chain and engineering in real time doing product redesign, we’re expanding gross margins, we’re expanding operating margins. We have a record Q2 for orders. We end Q2 with record backlog. We talked about the duration of backlog being stronger. And Jack talked about the pipeline activity and the order velocity and conversion. It’s excellent. And Jason talked about that we expect backlog to be strong for the balance of the remainder of the year.
The last two things I’d say is we referenced it a little bit, we just talked about Rave. I’m really proud of the acquisitions we’ve made, the integration work that’s been done organizationally and strategically, but also technically. And those acquisitions are performing at or above what we expected. We have – I love the upgrade. We just got, we have a strong balance sheet. We continue to be disciplined in capital allocation, and I think we have an excellent opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining us, and we’ll talk to you again in a few months. Thank you.

Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. First, Q4 was an exceptional quarter. We achieved record revenue in both segments and all 3 technologies, including double-digit growth in Video Security and Command Center highlighting the strength and robust demand for our Safety and Security Solutions that help protect people, property and places. Additionally, we expanded operating margins for the sixth consecutive quarter generated over $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo, creator of the HALO Smart Sensor.
Second, our full year results were outstanding. In our Products and SI segment, we grew revenue 9%, driven by strong growth in both LMR and Video Security, and we ended the year with record product backlog. We also expanded operating margins in the segment by 380 basis points, driven in part by higher ASPs and lower product costs.
In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, inclusive of the Airwave revenue reduction, highlighted by strong growth in Video Security, Command Center and our Services business outside of the U.K. And we also generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. And finally, as we enter 2024, our robust backlog position coupled with the continued strong demand for our safety and security solutions positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jason. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 5% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all 3 technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $16 million, while acquisitions added $17 million. GAAP operating earnings were $738 million or 25.9% of sales up from 25.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $870 million, up 6% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 10 basis points. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs.
GAAP earnings per share was $3.47, up from $3.43 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.90, up 8% from $3.60 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and higher margins. OpEx in Q4 was $597 million, up $60 million versus last year, primarily due to higher incentives and acquisitions in the current quarter -- current year. For the full year 2023, revenue was $10 billion, up 10%, with strong growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies.
Revenue from acquisitions was $98 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency rates was $38 million. GAAP operating earnings were $2.3 billion or 23% of sales versus 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, the $147 million ESN fixed asset impairment charge in the prior year and lower intangible amortization expense in the current year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.8 billion, up $416 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 27.9% of sales, up from 26% of sales in the prior year, driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and improved operating leverage.
GAAP earnings per share was $9.93, up 25% compared to $7.93 in the prior year, primarily driven by higher earnings and the asset impairment charge related to the exit of ESN in the prior year, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $11.95, up 15% from $10.36 in 2022 on higher earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, OpEx was $2.2 billion, up $178 million versus 2022, primarily driven by higher employee incentives and higher expenses associated with investments in Video and Rave. And the effective tax rate for 2023 was 21.9% compared to 20.1% in the prior year due to lower benefits from employee stock-based compensation in the current year.
Turning to our cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. And for the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
Capital allocation for 2023 included $804 million in share repurchases, $589 million in cash dividends and $253 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program and an 11% increase in our dividend, which is the 13th consecutive year of double-digit increases.
Moving next to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, Q4 sales were up 4% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Operating earnings were $567 million or 30.0% of sales, up from 28.4% in the prior year driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $90 million P25 system and devices order from a U.S. customer. A $67 million P25 device order for Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority in Australia, a $57 million P25 APX NEXT devices order for a U.S. customer. A $38 million P25 system order for the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety, a $31 million TETRA system order for a European customer and a $13 million fixed video order for an international customer.
And for the full year, Products and SI revenue was $6.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Full year operating earnings were $1.5 billion or 24.3% of sales, up from 20.5% in the prior year on higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and lower direct material costs.
In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was up 7%, driven by growth in Video, Command Center and LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million in the quarter, and FX tailwinds were $11 million. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $303 million and operating margins were 31.6%, down from 34.4% last year, primarily driven by the Airwave revenue reduction related to the price control. Some notable Q4 highlights in the segment include a $330 million LMR managed services renewal through 2034 for Denmark's nationwide public safety communications network. A $48 million Command Center order for the City of Chicago's Office of Public Safety Administration. A $20 million LMR service agreement for Spokane, Washington, Regional Emergency Communications and a $19 million mobile video order from a U.S. customer, and finally, a $10 million Command Center order for the City and County of San Francisco.
For the full year, revenue was $3.7 billion, up 10% on growth in LMR services, Command Center and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $83 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. For the full year, operating earnings were $1.3 billion or 33.9% of sales, down 140 basis points versus the prior year driven by the Airwave revenue reduction and higher acquisition-related expenses.
Looking next at our regional results. North America revenue was $2 billion in Q4, up 6% and $6.9 billion for the full year, up 9% driven by growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. And in international, Q4 revenue was $832 million, up 3% versus last year, driven by growth in Video and LMR. And for the full year, international revenue was $3 billion, up 11% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog for Q4 was $14.3 billion, down $88 million versus last year, inclusive of approximately $1 billion of backlog reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially, backlog was down $15 million, inclusive of the Airwave and ESN reduction and $160 million of favorable FX.
In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $93 million or 2%, driven primarily by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $99 million, also driven by demand in North America. In Software and Services backlog decreased $181 million from last year and $114 million sequentially. Excluding Airwave and ESN, Software and Services backlog was up almost $800 million versus last year, driven by strong multiyear agreements in both regions.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.55 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.62 and $12.72 per share.
This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Additionally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow with 2024 expectations of $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. And before I turn it back to Greg, I wanted to share some additional highlights. First, I want to give you some color on the technology growth expectations that are included in the sales guidance for the year. In Video Security & Access Control, we're planning for 10% growth, which is informed by the acceleration and strong adoption of our cloud offerings. For Command Center, we also expect 10% growth consistent with last year's organic growth rate. And in LMR, we expect to grow mid-single digits or high single digits when normalized for the impact of the U.K. home office. Second, I would like to share with you some exciting updates about our Video business.
In light of 2 recent partnerships that support our growth expectations, 1 with [ Jabil ] and another with Google. With [ Jabil ], we've entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement where [ Jabil ] will assume responsibility for our manufacturing operations at our sites in Canada and Texas. This agreement further optimizes our video supply chain, provides redundancy, future cost savings and scalability.
Additionally, it allows us to focus on engineering, designing and bringing to market video solutions that serve our customer security needs while continuing to enable regulatory compliance with NDAA rules for the procurement of secure equipment. And with Google, yesterday, we announced a new strategic agreement with Google Cloud that harnesses the power of their latest cloud advancements to enable assistive intelligence, such as accurate and reliable video content, mapping and other AI capabilities. Google Cloud also enables Avigilon Alta, our fast-growing cloud native fixed video and access control platform, which we introduced a little more than a year ago. Alta combines the power of our AI analytics with the ease and simplicity of a cloud-delivered VMS that is increasingly preferred by some verticals like education.
The rapid adoption in Alta contributed almost 1/4 of our growth last year to total video and includes a higher subscription attachment compared to a traditional Avigilon Unity sale. And finally, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including $1.7 billion in cash, a fixed rate balance debt maturity profile and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 is our lowest since 2015, providing us with ample flexibility to continue to deploy capital and drive shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back to Greg. Thanks, Jason. First, 2023 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved record sales in both segments and all 3 technologies, significantly expanded operating margins, grew earnings per share by 15% and generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo.
Second, this past November, we announced our new brand narrative Solving for Safer. This reflects our purposeful transformation centered on public safety and enterprise security and our sharpened focus on solving for safer communities, safer schools and safer businesses. Our solutions across LMR, Video Security & Command Center that are powered by artificial intelligence, enable collaboration between public safety agencies and enterprises, connecting those in need with those who can help. And while we recognize technology is not the only way to a safer future, it does play a vital role.
And finally, as we enter 2024, the momentum of our business remains strong. Funding for public safety continues to be a priority, investments we've made in the portfolio, including our APX NEXT device and by the way, the software applications that run on this device are driving higher ASPs for our products and strong growth in Software and Services. We're also seeing a noticeable acceleration of cloud adoption and video security that is driving margin accretive revenues in Software and Services. And with our exceptionally strong balance sheet, we have the opportunity to continue to deploy capital to drive long-term shareholder value. I'm extremely pleased how we're positioned, and I expect 2024 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for our company.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from George Notter with Jefferies. I have a question on the margin expansion in the business. I guess I wanted to ask about what kind of headwinds you guys still have running through the business in 2023. I'm thinking about things like expedite fees and even freight costs. I know that a lot of those fees didn't come out of the model until you guys had burn down some backlog. So I guess I'm wondering how much of the headwind was in the 2023 numbers? And then I assume that will be all out fully for the 2024 year, I'm just kind of wondering what kind of benefit you might get on margins there? And then just as a follow-up, a second question just on Silver Lake. I'm just curious about, is there any update there on what those guys might do? And how might you kind of fund the unwind of that position? George, so just to reconfirm, we do expect operating margin expansion for 2024. That's in part by informed continued improvement in PPV. I have to compliment Jason and the supply team and Jack's ops team did a great job exceeding what we set out as targets last year. And to remind you, we are expecting another $60 million of PPV improvement in this year in '24. From a gross margin standpoint, for the firm, we expect them to be comparable to slightly up. So I think we do a pretty good job on the operating leverage side of this business, both on gross margin and operating margin.
By the way, the OpEx envelope year-over-year is probably going to be up about $80 million '24 over '23 of which half is organic, $40 million and $40 million is inorganic. As it relates to Silver Lake, really no update that they are in the final year of their second 5-year pipe. It expires in September. The diluted share count is already calculated into our EPS expectations. So really nothing to report at this point. The partnership remains good, and we'll see how that plays forward for the balance of the year. By the way, we do expect, as we think about Silver Lake on the expiration of the pipe, we do expect higher interest expense this year to be about $40 million which includes the assumption of $1.3 billion of refinancing, of which $1 billion is the Silver Lake note and $300 million is debt that expires in September this year. The next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the top line. Maybe, Greg, for you the Q1 guide looks pretty strong, but the full year is a little bit lower on growth. So maybe can you talk about visibility or what you're kind of expecting in the back half of the year? Is it just compares or conservatism or anything else we need to be aware of for that little discrepancy in growth rates? And then I did want to, secondly, follow-up on the Video 10% growth. I mean, obviously, the numbers are getting bigger here. But can you kind of put that in context of where you are with share gains? And getting into deeper into the government verticals and getting some benefits this year from ARPA funding, say, on safe schools and other areas, if you can, just put that into context with some of those drivers, that would be great. So let's take the full year first. I think it's important to say that I'm super proud of last year. But to your point, as we're sitting here in February, backlog is strong, but Tim, so is the pipeline. So we're in a good aged backlog position, but the pipeline remains strong as well, which makes me feel good about where we sit here for the balance of the year. I'd also tell you that when we think about the full year guide, it's coming off of a Q4 that exceeded our guidance. It's coming off of a full year that exceeded our guidance. And if you anchor it to the color I gave last time at about $10.5 billion, it's about $75 million higher than that reference a quarter ago.
Now having said all that, so we guide for full year 6%. I remind you that $200 million is a headwind related to the U.K. Home Office. So year-over-year, we expect Airwave revenue to be about $375 million. But if you take year-over-year, you add in the $200 million full year U.K. Home Office headwind that can normalize the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, one other thing worth mentioning is, and Jack talked about this a quarter ago, we had exceptionally strong revenue contribution from Ukraine of $150 million last year. And based on what's expected to be shipped in backlog, we expect that to be $50 million. So you take the year-over-year 6%, you take $200 million decrement for U.K. Home Office headwind. You normalize for Ukraine, and I think our growth is quite solid and a prudent guide at this point in time. One other insight into the Video growth of approximately 10% this year. Within that, we're really pleased with the Cloud growth that we're seeing. Alta, which we talked about on the call as a platform, which is cloud native is growing exceptionally well. We've also made a decision to rationalize some of our on-prem VMS. And the combination of that growth rate in '24 and rationalizing the VMS is about $40 million of impact in 2024. So we're continuing to grow, and Jack, if you want to talk about the market and how we're doing in Video? Yes. Tim, I'd also dimensionalize both. Jason alluded to it both in script and his comments. Cloud's growing, but we also, our expectations are also that are on-prem business is very healthy, continues to grow. As it relates to share, we believe we're continuing to take market share. You also asked a question, Tim, in government. Total government video sales, that encompasses both mobile and fixed video, are now at $500 million in 2023. And I would highlight our government video growth is growing faster than our overall total business. So I think -- I don't think it's being driven at all by ARPA. I think it's being driven by prioritization and really building more and more efficiency and mobility within police forces as they have to contend with more and more crime. Tim, one other thing, just because we're still to George's question, weaning off PPV, and we'll have some commensurate benefits this year. If you take last year and this year, as we're working through this supply chain and elevated inventory and improved freight in PPV. If you look at first half and second half, Tim, to your point about guide and linearity, it's very similar to last year. So I'm not concerned about anything as we sit here with our expectation for the full year performance. The next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. One question, one follow-up. So just on the supply chain. I think this was alluded to a little bit, but just if you can give any more color on the latest you're seeing there? And any noticeable impact from some of the disruption we've seen on the Red Sea front, if that's impacted you guys at all in terms of costs? And then secondarily, can you just talk a little bit more about the [ Jabil ] agreements, strategic rationale there and any cost implications we should keep in mind? Sure. I'll answer the second one first. The [ Jabil ] agreement is for them in 2024 to operate the 2 factories that will be transitioning to them. So not a significant change in cost profile in '24. But as we look to '25 and with our growth expectations, there will be opportunities for cost as well as an efficient way to scale the growth that we're expecting. So it was an agreement in us looking into the future and we're very pleased with it and providing us additional redundancy as well. It will help us scale, grow and also manage our cost envelope as we grow. And the Red Sea? The Red Sea, we remain primarily on air as our mode of transportation. And so as a result, not a lot on the ocean and the impact of higher container rates is negligible for us. So given the state of the supply chain, while it's improving, we found that air and air rates are a good investment to make. And make sure that we're getting everything we need when we need it. We've seen continued improvement from supply chain and our vendors, particularly in semiconductors. And they have some improvements to make, and we expect them to continue to improve on the deliveries of, in particular, nanometer chips of 40 nanometers and above in some cases. So improving and working through it. And as we work through the year, it would be our expectation at the end of the year, to have overall inventory reduced again this year as things normalize and improve. That's relative to the [ $827 million ] you ended last year at? That's right... That's right. The [ $827 million was down $200 million ] from a 12-month predecessor, and we expect to drive the [ $827 million ] down even further by year's end as we navigate an improving environment. The next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Okay. Jason, I just wanted to start on backlog trends for a clarification. I know reported backlog in total appears -- the headline appears to be down. But I think there's a lot of impact from Airwave in that. Could you just give us a sense of what backlog looks like ex Airwave? And then just as a follow-up on that topic, either Jack or Greg or if you want to both weigh in. This is just a metric that I think investors are watching very closely because backlog builds and records have happened across tech hardware, whether it's Cisco and Networking or PCs before that and led to a sharper digestion period than initially anticipated once that backlog started softening. So I wonder if you could maybe just double-click on the current state of supply and demand and address how you think about the similarities or differences in what you're seeing in your business? And the time and shape of normalization if and when that does happen? Yes. I would start, Adam, and tell you that this is one of the things I'm most proud of when I look at the trend for the full year. Overall backlog of $14.3 billion, ending year from a year ago with absorbing just under $800 million decrement for the calculation of Airwave. And the 3-year plus or 3-year backlog that, that sits. So be able to keep that at the same level or comparable levels with that reduction is pretty significant.
The other thing that gives me optimism is the exceptionally strong product backlog that we exited Q4 and the aged backlog that we sit in the position of as we enter. But I also remind you, so I love the backlog position, but I also love the pipeline. And the ongoing demand and what I see in the funnel and when I look at Molloy and his team's conversion rates, I'm optimistic by what's in backlog. I'm also optimistic what's in pipeline. Couple of attributes, I think, that are important to understand in our backlog. First, over 95% of our backlog comes to us from our government customers and our public safety customers. So -- and the majority of that is a direct relationship and a contractual one between us and an end customer, that is very important. And secondly, as you think about our backlog, we entered the year much like last year in a position where about half of our revenues for the year, a little bit more than that, will come to us from backlog. And with that strength, combined with the pipeline strength, that's what informs our guide for our 6% growth. Exactly. Very helpful. Just quickly, Jason, sorry if I missed it. Did you talk about free cash flow expectations in 2024? And any benefit from working capital with the [ Jabil ] agreement? I know sometimes that could have some transitional working capital that may be favorable. So free cash flow and the potential benefit? Yes. Given the '24 is an operating place kind of steady agreement, the working capital benefits are minimal in terms of that agreement. That said, we do expect working capital improvement. We talked about inventory, our outlook for operating cash flow is $2.2 billion. That's up off of last year's record $2 billion. And within that operating cash flow, the contribution for our CapEx continues to be 15% or less. So we're expecting another strong year of cash flow. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. I just wanted to follow up on the last free cash flow question. I guess when I'm taking a look at it kind of implies that you're going to have a nice step up in free cash flow generation, which, in combination, exiting 2023 with, I think, $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It looks like you'll have a fair bit of dry powder. Can you just help us think about the appetite in '24 to deploy cash buybacks, M&A? Like should we be thinking about a more aggressive than typical nature? Any color would be appreciated. Just in terms of capital allocation, we always think of it, and I love the fact that we have the balance sheet that we do, Jason, in his remarks talked about 1.4 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. So I love the opportunity, the flexibility that, that gives us. I'm proud of the way we are good stewards of capital, both returning it to the shareholder and share repo and dividend but being surgical and thoughtful to accretive acquisitions as well. So you think about this cash flow, and I always think the wheel of 55/30/15. 55% of that cash flow is available for share repo or acquisition, fungible between the 2, representative of the opportunities that come our way. 30% is dividend and 15%, as Jason just referenced, is CapEx. Even though we made only 1 acquisition at the end of the year in IPVideo, it certainly wasn't reflective of the engagements that we had. I think there's a lot of opportunity.
I love the fact that we have the organic opportunity [indiscernible], whether it's device refresh, public safety prioritization, ARPA funding, enterprise opportunity, video and government. You know the opportunities that are in front of us organically, which are consequential. Equally, I'm excited about acquisition opportunities that can make our portfolio stronger, particularly around either Video, Software or Services. So that's how we think about it. The other thing that was noteworthy in '23, given the strength of our balance sheet is that we did earn an upgrade from Moody's to Baa2, and as Greg mentioned, we'll be in the debt markets this year, refinancing $1.3 billion. And so having taken note of the strength of the cash flow in '23 as well as our expectations in '24, that will help us as we refinance. I appreciate the color there. And then just for my follow-up, can we just get an update on Airwave? I noticed in the press release, it sounded like you guys have the option to file an application with the U.K. court of appeal. Like are you guys actually taking that step? Can you provide any color around that? And then any color in terms of the next steps beyond the filing and what other options you have at your disposal? Yes, we will pursue the next step, which is appealing to the U.K. Court of Appeals. We anticipate doing that next week. I've said all along, and we remain pretty consistent that, this whole thing is beyond unique. We still believe it's unprecedented. We think it's legally flawed, but I'm not going to wine about it. I'm consistent in our description we're going to pursue all the avenues available to us to defend our position. So to your point, that will be the filing of the appeal to the U.K. Court of Appeals next week, unclear how long that will take. Probably several months, but that remains to be seen. The only other thing I'd say is in public commentary that has been made with the CMA and other Parliamentary hearings. It's pretty obvious that they believe that Airwave will be needed well beyond 2026.
The references have been made by different parties to either needing it through 2029 or 2030. So we will continue to move forward as best we can, engaging where we can, maintaining the investments that we need to make in this network and customer service levels is as high as they've ever been. And just as a reminder, our current backlog with the adjustment we mentioned in Q4 has our contract with the U.K. Home Office through 2026. That's right. There's opportunity for us to serve that account beyond that. The next question is from the line of Tomer Zilberman with Bank of America. Just wanted to start off first with ARPA. I just want to get an update what it contributed to orders this year and your expectations going into next year? I know you previously noted it was 5% contribution in '22, and I think you said in the first half of this year, it was also 5%. Yes, Tomer, that's consistent with what we've said before. I think, the key thing I would say as it relates to budgets right now is public safety #1 continues -- public safety spend, it continues to get prioritized. Number two, I've just scoured through the state and local budget drafts of 2025. By and large, the situation remains very solid, even the states that have had an influx of immigrants have actually appropriated more dollars to public safety, which is interesting. But in generally speaking, when we look at it, the budget situation in state and local is very solid. Got it. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I know you've touched on backlog already, but curious how the duration of the backlog has improved in the last 3 months and maybe the start of this year? To begin this year, its duration is similar to slightly improved from the beginning of where we were entering last year. So the duration and the quality attributes of the backlog are as good or better than they were last year. The next question is from the line of Benjamin Bollin with Cleveland Research. Greg, bigger picture question. Going into an election year, curious how that has any impact, if at all, on how you guys thought about 2024 in your top line target? And then a secondary question would be, could you share your thoughts around the typical refresh that you see in the fixed video deployments? And how you think about replacement versus net new placements in the wild and how that kind of comes together in that 10% figure that you're talking about for Video growth this year? Yes. Ben, in terms of the election year, it's interesting, we always talk about this, too. If you kind of look back over the history of this business, we do pretty well irrespective of a Republican or a Democratic administration. So we've had great success in 2023. We expect to have another strong year this year. When there is a presidential change, there's always some period of transition. They'll typically operate under a continuing resolution. But in the main, generally speaking, we have a pretty solid foundational level of performance, with kind of low beta risk given the backlog and the continual high priority demand in public safety.
On fixed video, and we talked about, Jason articulated, the 10% target for this year. Look, I actually like the fact that we have the width and breadth of the portfolio that we do. So we have the broadest portfolio in Video, fixed or mobile, prem or cloud, and we can meet the customer wherever they want to be met to buy. Most of our customers have both cloud and prem. If, in fact, that there's a notable acceleration of cloud adoption, which we've seen and we are seeing that moves more toward cloud, that's great. If that moderates the top line growth from 15% to 10%, that's okay too, because of the long-term value of that dollar of revenue, the stickiness with the customer relationship. And as Molloy said, he and we still believe we're taking share. So we feel good about the position. In terms of refresh on cameras, Jack, maybe you want to talk about that? Yes, Ben, it obviously varies if there's citywide deployments, meaning outside cameras, you start to see a replacement cycle of anywhere to kind of 3 to 5 years in the networks that we manage. Internally, those upgrades are more driven by the R&D investments that Mahesh and team have made around analytics. I would note one thing. The acquisition we made in Pelco, we were actually very pleased in 2023 with the growth that Pelco had. But as we think about competitive VMSs that are out there, the work that we have ahead of us this year is to go and leverage our Pelco portfolio to drive new opportunities in the camera replacement cycle. Just one more thing to add to that is just to support our Alta growth with Video. One of our initial acquisition thesis was just the ability to expand the camera portfolio that Alta supports. And something that we did towards the end of last year was to expand the entire H6SL line, which is one of the more popular within the Avigilon camera family, now that is entirely supported with an Alta Video. And I think that's also going to help with the refresh cycles and also help with some of the transition to cloud. Unity 8, we introduced that last year, and Unity 8, one of the special things about it is it's not just an on-prem solution. It's actually an on-prem solution that can bridge into the cloud as well. So as we think about those transitions, the boundary between on-prem and cloud is a bit fuzzy and I think, in a good way for us. The next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Great job on the quarter and for the year. I guess, question for you on the IPVideo acquisition. Perhaps just walk us through some of the rationale for that acquisition and perhaps where you see some of the cross-selling opportunities and growth opportunities going forward? Sure. So the HALO Video Sensor or [ health ] Halo Sensor is actually not a new thing for us. We have -- Avigilon had partnered with IPVideo for quite some years. We have actually been reselling the IPVideo solution. And the key reason there is that there are plenty of situations like in schools where video cannot be used in certain locations, but these sensors can. So think of it as the detection of smoking vape sensors, et cetera, in bathrooms, in areas where we typically do not install cameras, but become quite important from a security and a safety standpoint. HALO is sort of the leading sensor when it comes to air quality, vape sensing, audio analytics, including gunshot detection. And so as we think about really expanding our capability within education and beyond. This was just a natural fit for us to bring in and integrate more closely with our Unity and Alta platforms. The only thing I can add on that, and just in terms of cross-sell would be that they've done very well in education. It's our role to get in and expand that business into health care into workplaces, into transit areas where you have issues with people smoking and those kind of things as well. We think we've got the relationships to extend into those markets as well. Okay. Makes sense. It's helpful. I appreciate it. As a follow-up question, changing gears on you slightly here. Another conversation on PCR. I know there's been some moving pieces throughout the year in terms of getting out in some of the areas like Asia, but perhaps just give an update on where PCR stands? I know there's been also some issues with supply chain earlier in the year. Any update would be helpful there? Yes. PCR actually did great in '23, Keith, about $1.1 billion of revenue last year, and it was a record in full year '23. So the performance by that team was exceptional. And I would expect PCR to be comparable levels this year that's informed into the LMR mid-single-digit technology growth or actually high single digit when you normalize for Airwave. So PCR is quite resilient and doing well. The next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. I was wondering, does Google bring any special benefits for partnering with them for Alta versus the other major cloud providers. I know you have, I think, a partnership with Azure for your Command Center business? Yes, Louie. So to begin with, Avigilon Alta video is already on Google Cloud today. And this is really a scale story and especially a scale around some key vectors, for example, AI. And so as we think about expanding Alta geographically as we think about expanding Alta and more broadly, video across our capability set. AI was important. Mapping capabilities was important, low latency data delivery, video delivery was important, and we thought that Google would be a good partner as we expand our installation and our capability of deploying within Google Cloud.
In terms of sort of more a broader comment on this, look, there's lots of stuff happening in the cloud world today, whether that's on the AI side, core cloud services, et cetera. And we want to be able to provide our customers with the best performance at the best price point. And so this Google partnership is really part of our multi-cloud strategy at the end of it all. So that's really what drove it. Great. And are the economics significantly different for Alta versus Unity? Are you actively pushing for one instead of the other? We're positioned to offer our customers a choice, as Jack mentioned, we have growth expectations for both Unity, the on-prem as well as Alta customers like those in education, we mentioned on the call are increasingly choosing Alta. The difference between the two is really how the VMS or software layers delivered. In the case of Alta, the VMS is delivered and deployed through the cloud under a term license. And in the case of Unity, it's an on-prem and more of a perpetual with a maintenance arrangement. So those are the two models we have, Jack? Customers are. Two things there, Louie, is the purchase decision remains very dynamic up until the last, call it, 2 to 3 weeks of a decision. But it's interesting as we look at win-loss data, one of the interesting things is that we've had competitors who are more point solution providers who have been eliminated from decisions, and we've had both Alta and Unity is finalist decisions, which, again, I think speaks to the breadth and the advantage that gives us in the marketplace. And Louie, while the customer decides, it's not so much what we push, it's what they want. And as Jack said many customers deployed, they deploy both. Cloud fixed video is smaller from our overall revenue contribution than prem fixed video, but it's noteworthy to say that the growth of cloud fixed video is a strong multiple of the prem solution. Yes. Is there increasing momentum for Alta? I think you mentioned how 25% of the growth for 2023 with Video is from Alta. Do you think that 25% is going to increase to 35% or something like that in 2024? I don't know. It depends on what '24's growth composition ultimately ends up being. But what I will say is the cloud solution, in our case, Alta is growing significantly faster than prem. So it's hard to predict the composition at the end of year '24 until we see how things settle. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You've got [ Jamie ] on for Meta. Similar to one of the earlier questions and understanding that you're still seeing strong growth and some impressive wins in the quarter. The Q4 growth and accompanying 2024 outlook and Command Center, just looked a little bit lower than what we've been modeling. So I guess, is there any additional detail you can provide as to what you're seeing there and what's driving that outlook on '24? And then as a follow-up, how should we think about the contribution from pricing broadly and the growth outlook for '24? And maybe we could tag team this. But Command Center, that's another one I was particularly proud of because we grew 21% for the year. Now obviously, Rave was a key driver in that. And Rave has turned out to be a great acquisition for us actually exceeding its business case. If you take that out, [ Jamie ], and you normalize for organic growth, the organic growth is another solid year of 10% growth. And by the way, that's inclusive of the growth of a $25 million headwind that actually represents the transitioning out of ESN. So when you think about the overall 10% growth of Command Center, you do have to include the normalization of the exit of ESN that's worth $25 million, but growth remains pretty strong in that segment as well. And in terms of growth drivers for '24, we would expect growth from both volume and price, inclusive of ASPs continuing to grow as they did in '23 as our customers adopt more of the feature-rich part of the portfolio, including APX NEXT, in other parts of the portfolio, we would expect that to continue, and that's included in our growth expectations. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Yes. Thanks. Listen, thank you for dialing in and listening. I would just close by saying that I think as we're entering 2024 or in it now in February, it's pretty clear that public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. I love the fact that we've got the broadest and most comprehensive product portfolio. I like the fact that as customers index to a more notable adoption on cloud acceleration. We're able to capitalize on that with our Alta solution.
I love the fact that we have the APX NEXT refresh cycle, in particular, continue to march forward, and that remains robust. And as was mentioned on the call, I am particularly excited about our partnership with Google. For all of the Motorolans listening in on the call, I'm really proud of you. I'm proud of our team's execution in '23, and I'm anticipating another strong year in 2024, and I appreciate everything you're doing. I look forward to catching up and talking with you and debriefing in a quarter. Thanks again for all the great work. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions].
I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO.
Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding start to the year. We achieved revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth of 27%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated record Q1 operating cash flow of $382 million. We also finished the quarter with $14.4 billion of backlog, up $300 million versus last year.
Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based. In our Products and SI segment, revenue was up 14% and operating margins increased 590 basis points as we continue to see strong demand for our feature-rich LMR products, including APX NEXT and our refreshed PCR portfolio. In Software and Services revenue was up 4%, inclusive of the Airwave charge control and our exit from the ESN contract. Excluding U.K. Home Office revenues, Software and Services revenues increased double digits, driven by continued strong demand for our LMR service offerings and our software applications in Video Security and Command Center. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 10% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all 3 technologies. GAAP operating earnings were $519 million or 21.7% of sales, up from 18.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $638 million, up 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 220 basis points. The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales a favorable mix shift as our customers invest in more feature-rich LMR products and improved operating leverage, offset by the U.K. CMA charge control related to Airwave. GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.23 and included a $585 million charge, resulting in a $3.42 per share pretax nonoperating loss due to the accounting treatment for the settlement of the Silver Lake convertible notes.
We settled these notes entirely in cash for approximately $1.59 billion inclusive of the conversion premium, which eliminated potential dilution to our share count and reflected a favorable negotiated settlement price compared to the indenture terms. As a result, we recognized a nonoperating loss for the settlement during the quarter. According to the current accounting rules for convertible notes, which were updated in 2022. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.81, up 27% from $2.22 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, lower interest cost and a lower diluted share count. OpEx in Q1 was $568 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a Q1 record of $382 million, up $390 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $336 million, up $398 million. The strong increase in cash flow was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings net of noncash charges. Capital allocation for Q1 included $163 million in cash dividends $46 million of CapEx and $39 million of share repurchases. We also used $593 million of cash to settle the Silver Lake conversion premium and we closed the acquisition of Silent Sentinel, a provider of specialized long-range cameras for $37 million net of cash required.
Moving to segment results. In Products and SI, sales were up 14% versus last year, driven by continued strong demand, combined with improved supply availability and a favorable mix shift in LMR products. Operating earnings were $370 million or 24.8% of sales, up from 18.9% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $22 million P25 device order for a large U.S. customer, a $16 million LMR order for an international customer, a $13 million order for the State of Tennessee and a $13 million mobile video order for North Carolina State Highway Patrol.
In Software and Services, revenue was up 4% compared to last year. S&S revenues, excluding the U.K. Home Office were up 12%, driven by strong growth in all 3 technologies. Operating earnings in the segment were $268 million or 29.8% of sales down from the 32.9% of sales last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Excluding the impact of the U.K. Airwave charge control, Software and Services margins increased year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $25 million LMR services order for Douglas County, Colorado, a $25 million LMR services order for U.K. Department of Health, an $18 million Command Center order for the city of San Francisco, a $14 million LMR services order for Lithuania and an $11 million services order for São Paulo State Police in Brazil.
Moving next to our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 13% on strong double-digit growth in both segments. International Q1 revenue was $696 million, up 3% versus last year with growth in video and LMR, offset by lower U.K. Home Office revenues related to the UK Home Office Airwave charge control and our exit of ESN. International revenue, excluding the U.K. Home Office impact increased double digits year-over-year in both segments.
Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.4 billion, up $331 million versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand for multiyear Software and Services contracts in both regions. The year-over-year increase is inclusive of the reduction of $777 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the Airwave charge control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN over the last year. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $748 million of backlog related to the receipt of a 3-year extension notice from the U.K. Home Office for years 2027 through 2029.
Our total backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up over $500 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $138 million, driven by the extension notice related to Airwave that I just mentioned, partially offset by our typical Q4 to Q1 order seasonality in North America and some favorable -- unfavorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was down $74 million, primarily due to unfavorable FX. Sequentially, backlog was down $354 million due to the Q4 to Q1 North America order seasonality that I mentioned.
And then Software and Services backlog was up $404 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear services and services contracts in both regions. Our S&S backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up almost $600 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $492 million, driven primarily by the extension notice related to Airwave, partially offset by Q4 to Q1 order seasonality.
Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 7% and 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.97 and $3.02 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 7%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 6%. And with that, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.98 and $13.08 per share, up from our prior guidance of $12.62 to $12.72 per share. In addition, with the U.S. dollar strengthening since our last call, this full year outlook now assumes an FX headwind of $30 million, primarily in the second half. It also includes a weighted average diluted share count between 170 million and 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And finally, as a result of the debt issuance and Silver Lake settlement we completed in Q1 and we now expect full year interest expense to be approximately $240 million, up $25 million year-over-year.
Before turning the call back to Greg, I want to highlight, just a couple of balance sheet-related items. During the quarter, we used $593 million to settle in cash the premium for the Silver Lake notes that I mentioned. We also repurchased 39 million of shares, resulting together in a combined total of $632 million targeted at reducing our diluted share count. Also during the quarter, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to BBB underlying the strength of our business and the balance sheet. Following the upgrades, we issued $1.3 billion of debt, $900 million of 10-year and $400 million of 5-year notes, further extending our average debt maturity, which is now over 8 years, all fixed at an average rate below 4.5%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the new debt issuance to pay off the $1 billion convertible notes and plan to use the remainder to settle the approximately $300 million of debt maturity coming due later this year.
I'll now turn the call back to Greg. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was outstanding across the Board. We achieved strong revenue growth in all 3 technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We generated record Q1 operating backlog -- operating cash flow and our strong ending backlog positions us well going forward. As a result, we're raising our expectations for both revenue and earnings for the full year.
Second, during the quarter, we announced that we mutually agreed with Silver Lake to settle the convertible notes. Silver Lake has been a great partner since their initial investment in 2015, and I'm very pleased that Greg Mondre is remaining on our Board. And finally, as I look forward, I'm exceptionally pleased with how well we're positioned. The investments we've made in our LMR product portfolio are driving meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion. Our recurring revenues are increasing as a result of the continued strong demand for our services. We continue to see accelerated adoption of our cloud offerings, including Rave and Command Center and Avigilon Alta in Video Security and our strong balance sheet positions us well to invest both organically and inorganically for continued growth.
We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, still expect to generate $2.2 billion of operating cash flow for the year, we refinanced and extended a portion of our debt portfolio, and we received upgrades from 2 credit rating agencies during the quarter. All of this provides us with significant continued flexibility in how we deploy capital going forward.
I'll now turn the call over to Tim and look forward to your questions. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Maybe the first question would be on video, and then I have a follow-up on LMR. The video side, decent growth in the quarter. I'm just hoping you could talk about a few things there. First, where are we with impact movements to cloud and what effect that had on the quarter?
And the second piece, Jason, it looks like a very high if you're looking at the software services percentage of the Video business, it was over 40%. So just curious if we're starting to see an inflection there? Or was it just an anomaly because maybe the hardware piece was a little bit lower this quarter. Then I'll -- after that, I'll follow back with the LMR follow-up. Yes. Tim, on Video, pleased with the results in Q1. As you know, we remain convicted around the 10% for the full year. We did talk about last quarter that we are seeing an increased adoption to Avigilon Alta and cloud adoption. We talked last quarter and it remains unchanged. That's probably about -- probably a $40 million estimated headwind in terms of the top line growth number that informs the 10% but feel very good about Q1's performance. And by the way, in particular, the orders for video were strong, both in fixed and mobile. And Tim, on the second part of your question, you're right, software within video is growing faster than the product side. That's a trend we've been seeing. And keep in mind, it's not just Alta, it's all of the exciting developments that we have around analytics. Both of our VMSs, our software products are recorded there. Mobile video is also there, all complemented by cloud subscription. So that's a very important and fast-growing part of our business. Now the LMR piece. And then maybe second -- yes. Just on LMR, Greg, you talked about a lot of the investments there. And obviously, it's bearing fruit and other growth rate above expectations. Can you just talk about kind of where we are in the cycle there? That would be great. Yes. I think -- look, I can't be more pleased with the performance of LMR products and services. And Jack talked about the continued strong demand last quarter, it's the same as this quarter. In terms of APX NEXT, as an example, a lot of customers are indexing and in Q1 indexed to more feature-rich devices which helped drive revenue and quite frankly, Tim, margin expansion.
But I'd actually -- I think the way to think about LMR growth is APX writ large, the entire segment for APX Radio. They're newer. They've been upgraded. We talk about APX NEXT, which is the very high end, but the whole portfolio which we also talk about APX Originals performing exceptionally well. And then when you go over to TETRA and PCR, where we've refreshed devices there as well, that's gone very well. In fact, PCR, we now expect to grow slightly up off of record levels last year. So I'd say we're still in the middle of the game on device refresh with a lot more to run. Really pleased on that front. The only thing Tim I'd add on top of that is, as just Greg pointed out, it's the breadth of the portfolio is a strength. But what's particularly driving the APX NEXT adoption are the applications. So in the quarter, in Q1, we secured 2 large state patrols as well as on Department of Transportation, as you think about what drives those, it's location. It's the ability to extend the network vis-a-vis SmartConnect and Smart Programming with large fleets, their ability to reprogram and the like in a more expeditious fashion, so. Jack, you've seen customers embrace a blended fleet too. Exactly, right. In fact, all 3 of those customers have APX Original and like 1/3 of those are APX NEXT. Good point. The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Congrats on the strength here. I guess I'll go back to kind of the Airwave situation. I saw the renewal and the extension of the contract. Anything new there in terms of the CMA situation, and obviously, you guys adjusted your financials to reflect the negative outcome. But I know there's a court case, an appeal that's going on? I mean, any expectations or anything you can tell us about what's going on there would be great. Yes. Thanks, George. So we recorded the backlog of the extension of years '27, '28 and '29, because in March, we received notice from the U.K. Home Office for the extension of Airwave. Aside from our disputes, let's put that off to the side for a minute. I think it confirms our belief all along in the durability, longevity and quite frankly, criticality of mission-critical LMR, particularly in this case, Airwave. So it reaffirms the long-standing need of how critical that technology is, and that's one of the best performing from a network performance standpoint, emergency networks in the world.
To your point, we took the backlog and recorded it at kind of worst-case scenario, i.e., it's logged -- the log backlog is at the charge control rates, which we are still contesting. As it relates to the Court of Appeal, we -- the CMA issued their final decision. We appealed to the CAT, the Competition Appeals Tribunal. We lost that. And as a result, appealed to the Court of Appeal, the U.K. Court of Appeal to see if they'll hear that case. We would expect to get clarity on that either in May or June. But having said that, we will continue to defend our position on the circumstances and conditions that extended Airwave, and we will defend ourselves accordingly. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Any evidence that there's any spread of other managed services customers looking at trying to reprice contracts with you guys anywhere else in the world? No. No. I think the U.K. is very, very unique in many ways, but the answer is no. . [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You've got Jamie Reynolds on for Meta. I appreciate you taking the questions. I think last quarter, you guys had highlighted a $100 million headwind from less business in Ukraine. I guess, has your thinking changed there as it relates to the recent aid package that got passed? Our view on the full year and what's informing our raise does not change from what we updated you on the Ukraine situation last year. We did talk about $100 million, Jack referenced that about $100 million headwind. By the way, that headwind still exists. It's primarily in the second half of this year, which informs kind of the seasonality that's implied in both Q2 and our full year guide. By the way, we remain in game, I'm thrilled. We're thrilled that the Foreign Aid Bill got passed for $95 billion and Molloy's team remains actively engaged on multiple fronts. But our view in terms of the full year guide is unchanged from what we said last time. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Is the thinking changed around what you expect from the Command Center piece of the business to contribute to growth this year? Still very enthusiastic about Command Center overall as a category. We still expect 10% growth for the full year. By the way, I might add that remember, ESN in the way we record revenue was in the Command Center technology bucket. So Q1 would have grown handsome double digits normalized for U.K. Home Office. And quite frankly, when you look at the 10% guide implied for Command Center for the full year, it's a number higher than that when you normalize for ESN as well. And you may want to mention just some of the other things going on. We just actually finished our summit. This has been our largest summit, I think, ever, over 1,300 customers attending. We launched our VESTA NEXT refreshed products, both for cloud and for on-prem, along with quite a few other new launches or responder, our mobile app. So it's been -- traction has been amazing, and we see greater than 60% of our Command Center customers now adopting a cloud connected product and Rave and our other Command Center cloud products are doing exceptionally well beyond expectations. . The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. I just want to start maybe first for Jason. Great performance on margins in the Product segment. Just wondering the pricing benefit and supply chain cost is reflected in this versus how much is left in future quarters? I know Q1 is typically the low point for margins in that segment. I'm wondering if that's still going to hold for 2024 and improve from there.
And Greg, just conceptually on the topic of margins, I know expanding margins is important to you. The drivers are very clear to us in fiscal '24 price cost, et cetera. But it's a little bit less obvious as we think about fiscal '25 and beyond. Just if you could help us maybe with conceptual levers to continue to drive margin expansion beyond this year? Or do you think we're sort of at optimal margin and the focus might be more on growth, how to balance that equation. Sure. So I'll take the first one. We remain seeing the $60 million of lower broker costs, we call the PPV that we guided to 90 days ago. That's a full year number. Q1 included some of that benefit. There's more to go in getting to the total $60 million. We're on path for that. We are seeing certainly the need to use far less and the supply improvements from our direct vendors are helping us get the parts we need at the price we need. That's in part what informed our Q1 as well as our expectations for the year, complemented by the continued strong demand. So on plan in terms of the margin improvements related to lower supply chain costs, I would also point to what we talked about on the call is the continued benefit of customers adopting more feature-rich parts of the portfolio. That comes with a margin improvement for us as well. And in terms of margins, we -- by the way, this year, we do expect gross margins to be up slightly, and we also now expect operating margins to be up about 75 basis points. As we think about it holistically and kind of on a pro forma basis, we think the levers of volume mix, which we're enjoying now, some surgical price increases, primarily around services, where we have contracts that have appropriate cost of living mechanisms built into multiyear services contracts. And as they come due we will be disciplined in making sure we're recovering appropriate cost increases that come and hit the firm.
We look at the way we price new product as well and we continue to refresh the device portfolio and also fixed and mobile video. And then OpEx. By the way, OpEx probably will be up about $100 million this year, year-on-year. Last quarter, we told you it was about $80 million. That $20 million increase, actually, I think it's a good thing. We're investing more in the business, indexing particularly around video. We're likely to have some higher incentives around sales commissions, reflective of the higher revenue guide we're giving you for the full year. And there's some ancillary legal costs, which I actually consider investments in the business as we defend our position, both with the U.K. Home Office and continue to fight the good fight on Hytera and we'll report hopefully more news between now and the end of the year on that front.
And the other thing I'd tell you on the OpEx side, as you know, we acquired Silent Sentinel. Given the balance sheet, the aperture is pretty wide but disciplined on acquisitions we may pursue and close. And if we do that, we do that because it's financially accretive, it's strategically important. It's culturally compatible, and we can operate it or operationalize it and integrate it operationally, but also because we expect synergies on that front, too. We are built, I think, as a team, an executive team and as a company, that growing is not good enough. You've got to grow top line, you got to grow margins, you got to grow operating cash flow and you got to take share. That's when you know the firm is cooking on all cylinders. And we always look at operating margins. We're proud of them, but we know the there's more work to be done.
And by the way, I didn't even mention AI. I know a lot of companies tout it, but we'll be disciplined in our use of that internally, the [indiscernible] Jack have built it into a lot of our products in the analytics that Jason mentioned. I love what we're doing, descriptive and Generative AI as it relates to the ecosystem, around public safety and physical security. But obviously, we'll also use it in customer service internally in legal and contract management with copilot and engineering efficiencies. So that really isn't factored in at this point, and I'm not making any declaration of promises, but we'll always be able to, I think, aspirationally drive toward operating margin improvement. And I think we have the assets where we can continue to do that. Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up. I know that was a 2-parter, but I'll do a quick follow-up since I'm going to get asked on this tonight. Backlog trends. Obviously, we've got a record here. But correct me if I'm wrong, I think that $14.4 billion includes $748 million of incremental backlog on Airwave. It may be unfair to strip that out, but if we do, it's down about $500 million sequentially. And I know there's some seasonality to that, but that's kind of 2x its normal seasonality. What would that concern of stripping that out and looking at kind of a worse than typical seasonal decline in backlog be missing? And how do you think about backlog trends from here? So Adam, I mentioned it earlier, if I -- if we exclude the Home Office impact on a multi-quarter basis, total backlog is up over $500 million and S&S backlog is up over $600 million. So while we recorded the $748 million in this Q1 related to the extension of years '27, '28, '29. We also in the quarter before that, reduced the backlog related to the pricing control implemented for years, '24, '25 and '26. So they're a bit of a cancellation, if you will, and then the core of the business at Home Office is absolutely growing. I will pause for a few seconds to see if we have any additional questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Yes. Thank you. First and foremost, I want to thank the Motorola Solutions employees around the world and our channel partners. It's a great team, very proud of the performance in the quarter and very proud of what I think we can do between now and the end of the year. I do want to highlight, we had some great significant events in Q1, Mahesh mentioned 1 of them, the Solutions Summit in Dallas. A week ago, we had 1,300 customers. It's the largest ever event we had on that front. We demonstrated operational working public safety an enterprise security ecosystem. It was significant, well attended and lots of good feedback.
We had our first-ever joint channel partner -- executive partner forum, in February, in Orlando. The significance of that is it brought together LMR, Land Mobile Radio channel partners and Video Security and Access Control under 1 roof with common vernacular, common language, relationships we're looking to develop. And Molloy's had this mantra cross-sell, upsell. I thought that was an excellent event that was a catalyst to kind of culture and focus items we need around upselling the writ large broader portfolio between now and the end of the year. And we had a great presence at ISC West, which highlighted, of course, Video Security and Access Control, rolled out our enterprise body-worn camera, which we're getting great traction on body worn on the enterprise. So a lot of good stuff in Q1.
Look, at the end of the day, the print is great in Q1, but I'm actually more excited about our momentum, raising the year, strong backlog, but also strong funnel of opportunity and a strong balance sheet couldn't be more proud. I want to thank everybody. Thanks for listening, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. This does conclude today's teleconference.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may now begin your conference. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2024, second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO.
Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.
A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assets that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call and the Risk Factors section of our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason goes through our results and outlook. .
First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with record Q2 revenue and operating earnings. Products and SI revenue was up 15% and operating earnings were up 56%, driven by continued strong demand and favorable mix within LMR products. In Software and Services, revenue was flat, excluding the home office, from the U.K., revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all 3 technologies. And we also increased earnings per share by 22%, generated $180 million of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $14 billion of backlog, positioning us well for our continued growth.
Second, I'm encouraged by the continued momentum we're seeing across the business. In video security, revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in both our fixed and mobile video solutions and increasing in software and services. In Command Center, revenue increased 9%, as customers continue to adopt our solutions that help them effectively accelerate response and resolution of incidence. And in LMR, revenue increased 9%, inclusive of the U.K. home office headwinds driven by LMR products as well as Managed and Support Services.
And finally, based on our Q2 results, robust demand and continued prioritization for safety and security by our customers, we're again raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all 3 technologies, Acquisitions added $13 million, while FX headwinds were $5 million during the quarter. GAAP operating earnings were $644 million or 24.5% of sales, up from 21.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $758 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%, up 210 basis points, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage partially offset by the Airwave charge control.
GAAP earnings per share was $2.60, up from $2.15 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24, up 22% from $2.65 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. OpEx in Q2 was $593 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions.
Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $180 million, up $87 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $112 million, up $72 million. These increases were primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by higher employee incentives and higher cash taxes. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $562 million, up from $85 million in the previous year on higher earnings and significantly improved working capital. And we now expect operating cash flow for the full year to be $2.25 billion, an increase of $50 million versus our prior expectations and double-digit growth expectations over last year.
Capital allocation for Q2 included $163 million in cash dividends, $71 million in share repurchases and $68 million of CapEx. Subsequent to the quarter end, we also closed 2 acquisitions for a total of $223 million. The first is a global provider of critical event management software that expands our command center presence internationally and also complements our Rave acquisition. The second is a provider of vehicle location and management solutions that further builds on our leadership in providing mobile video solutions for the financial services sector. We expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million of revenue per quarter primarily in video and to be slightly dilutive to the second half of this year.
Moving to segment results and Products and SI, sales were up 15% versus last year, driven by continued demand along with improvements in supply in LMR. Currency headwinds were $2 million in revenue from acquisitions contributed $12 million. Operating earnings were $445 million or 26.8% of sales, up from 19.8%, in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $32 million P25 system and device order for the city of Naperville, Illinois, a $19 million P25 system upgrade for Washington County, Virginia, an $18 million P25 system order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $17 million P25 device order for a U.S. customer, an $8 million fixed video order for a large state and local customer and a $6 million video order for Newark public schools in New Jersey.
In Software and Services, revenue was flat compared to last year, excluding the U.K. Home Office, revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all 3 technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $1 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $3 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $313 million or 32.3% of sales, down from 36.9% last year due to the revenue reduction related to the Airwave charge control. which was partially offset by improved operating leverage elsewhere in the segment.
Excluding the U.K. Home Office, Software and Services operating margins increased during the quarter on higher sales and improved operating leverage.
Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $19 million LMR order for the Victorian state government in Australia, an $18 million LMR order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $12 million command center order for the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, an $11 million LMR order for American Airlines. And finally, we received a $16 million mobile video award with Police Scotland. This award was part of a $30 million investment made by Police Scotland to procure body-worn cameras, LMR radios and mobile application software, demonstrating their recognition of the strength of our integrated ecosystem.
Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 17% on growth in all 3 technologies. International Q2 revenue was $711 million, down 7% versus last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Excluding the U.K. Home Office, International revenue was up mid-single digits with growth in all 3 technologies.
Moving to backlog. Ending total backlog for Q2 was $14 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million or 2% versus last year. Excluding the U.K. Home Office, total backlog was $12.5 billion, up from $12.4 billion last year. In the Products and SI segment ending backlog decreased $482 million versus last year and $308 million sequentially, driven by strong LMR shipments as supplier lead time improvements enabled us to ship additional products earlier in the year and improve our sales linearity.
In software and services backlog increased $164 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear software and services contracts across all 3 technologies, partially offset by 12 months of revenue recognition from the U.K. Home Office. Sequentially, backlog was down $129 million, primarily driven by the quarterly revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office.
Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth between 7% and 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.37 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of 24%.
For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and earnings per share guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $13.22 and $13.30 per share, up from our prior guide of $12.98 to $13.08 per share.
The full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. It also assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points, up from our prior expectation of 75 basis points, driven by higher sales.
And finally, before turning the call back to Greg, I wanted to share some insights regarding our increased expectations for the year. In video, we now expect approximately 12% of growth for the full year, inclusive of the recent M&A. Video continues to be an exciting opportunity for us with new products like [ ACCA ] video management system, H6 cameras, our latest AI-enabled video recorder and both cloud and on-premises offers.
And for LMR, we're increasing our expectations to mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year, which includes the headwinds related to the U.K. home office that we communicated at the beginning of the year.
On the continued strength of LMR, I'd point to a couple of important drivers. First, in LMR services, we have a significant installed base, and our customers are increasingly relying on our expanded services offerings such as cyber and software upgrade agreements as they continue to invest in their networks for the long term. And second, in LMR products, strong demand for feature-rich devices continues to drive growth and margin expansion. For example, we have thousands of public safety customers who are on multi-year technology refresh cycles. These customers are increasingly adopting advanced devices like our APX NEXT family of devices.
I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our Q2 results highlight the continued momentum we're seeing across the business. We achieved strong revenue growth in all 3 technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We grew earnings per share by 22%, and we generated $180 million of operating cash flow. .
Second, we're continuing to use our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to create shareholder value and invest for continued growth. Year-to-date, we've spent a little over $700 million to reduce our diluted share count.  Inclusive of the Silver Lake convertible note and share repurchases, and we've invested more than $250 million on acquisitions, adding solutions like long-range cameras, vehicle location and critical event management software.
We also expect to spend approximately $850 million of R&D this year, focused on expanding our powerful safety and security offerings across the business. And we recently announced the opening of the R&D center in Cork, Ireland, which will focus on designing software for the company's comprehensive land mobile radio portfolio.
These investments enhance our powerful ecosystem where video, radio and software work together to improve situational awareness, automate response, and more efficiently manage evidence across the various devices and platforms used by security personnel.
And finally, as we enter the second half of the year, I really like how we're positioned. Our solutions have never been more important for customers as they continue to prioritize safety and security. We're seeing increased adoption of our cloud offerings in video and command center, which drove record Q2 backlog in those respective technologies. And we've launched several new products including VESTA Next, our new cloud-based 911 call handling solution and our MXP 660 TETRA radio, which is the APX NEXT equivalent for the TETRA market, providing both LMR and LTE capabilities in the same device. All of this is driving continued demand and in orders pipeline that's now about $1 billion higher than it was at this point last year, positioning us very well for growth going forward.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to a comment [indiscernible]. Operator can you please remind our callers on the line on how to ask a question. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Tim Long from Barclays. This is actually Alyssa Shreves on for Tim Long. I just wanted to check in given the outperformance we've been seeing in LMR, what inning are we in, in the LMR refresh cycle? We've had 2 strong quarters on the back of strong quarters from the year prior. Just how should we kind of think about the business moving into 2H? And then I had a quick follow-up. Yes. I think -- look, we're really pleased with the device refresh and the newer portfolio, we continue to release globally. I think when I think of the APX NEXT family, of devices, it accounts -- we think it will account for less than 1/4 of the public safety device shipments this year. So that dimensionalizes kind of the opportunity for that.
And by the way, we also, as I mentioned in the remarks, also just announced it's equivalent, the MXP 660 for TETRA, which opens up Europe and the international market, and that's a brand-new product. which takes the combination of LMR and LTE capabilities to one device. So I think that is a contributing factor, but the demand for LMR, both product, services, devices, and [indiscernible] large, the whole technology portfolio remains quite strong. And Alyssa, we mentioned during the call that our outlook for LMR as a whole of the technology this year has gone from mid- to mid- to high. That will include growth in both products for the year as well as software and services [indiscernible] office. So strong growth drivers across.
And within the quarter and within the first half, with the supply chain improvements that we saw, products and LMR products specifically, we were able to attain more supply and lead times improved which in part drove the performance for the first half in LMR products. And then just a quick follow-up on the video business. Has there been any change in terms of what you've been seeing with customer cadence with customers moving from on-prem to cloud? So we talked about a $40 million headwind, Alyssa, this year kind of incorporating the prem to cloud momentum that you just referenced. In Q2, our video software business grew 24%. Cloud and cloud adoption was exponentially higher than that. So quite frankly, it's performing as expected and cloud adoption remains very strong. The next call comes from the line of Matt Niknam at Deutsche Bank. First question is on M&A. Greg, I think you've been vocal around, I guess, perhaps an increasing number of opportunities, perhaps more willingness on the part of prospective sellers in the marketplace. We saw -- you talked about the 2 deals you've recently done. I'm just curious if you can maybe give us a little bit more of an overview in terms of what you're seeing, the latest out there in the M&A front and potential opportunities.
And then secondarily, maybe a follow-up on cash flow. So the guide this year is for about $2.25 billion you've done, I believe, $562 million year-to-date. So can you just talk a little bit about the visibility and confidence in that second half ramp? And I guess, in particular, how we should think about working capital in that context? But just on the second one first, we increased our operating cash flow expectations from $2.2 billion to $2250 million $2.250 billion. I think that's a reflection of the confidence you're asking about in our ability to generate cash flow. Remember also the linearity of the way cash flow is generated by this business overwhelmingly, it's typically back half -- actually even more heavily weighted in Q4. And we expect the linearity of the cash flow generated and the yield associated to be reflective of that as well. Actually, Greg, it's even better linearity this year with our first half. We're strongly ahead of where we were last year as inventory working capital have come down. But you're right, the back half is usually significant cash flow contributors, and we're well on path to the 2.25 in the quarter. On the M&A front, Matt, we like the 2 acquisitions we made. We like the fact, and you know I think we're pretty good stewards of capital. And we always think about the deployment of capital along a framework of 55%, 25%, 15%. 55% fungible between share repo and opportunistic M&A, 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. That's kind of a reference framework.
I do think the M&A funnel, even at this point for us, is quite active. And there's some interesting opportunities. Like anything, we'll see if they materialize, but I like the way the business is performing and the underlying demand drivers organically reflective of the portfolio we have. Equally, I am energized by the opportunity as it presents itself from an M&A funnel standpoint, but we'll see. We certainly have the balance sheet capacity with net debt to net EBITDA of about and a recent upgrade to BBB a quarter ago. So I like the firepower we have, but we'll remain very disciplined and focused on how and where we deploy it. The next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. I wanted to ask about backlog. I guess trying to better understand how we should think about backlog, Greg. There are puts and takes here. I think you said it was down sequentially, but up year-on-year when we exclude the U.K. Airwave situation. I think in the year ago quarter, you had some big chunky orders also. There may be some other puts and takes I'm missing as well. But can you kind of walk me through how we should look at your backlog performance this quarter? Sure. So first of all, it's a good question, George. Total backlog is up, as Jason referenced year-over-year when you exclude the home office. That's kind of one reference point. Product backlog, while it deteriorated in Q2, it deteriorated because supply lead times improved really a lot faster than we thought, which informed the 19% print on LMR product growth in Q2.
Having said that, product backlog remains pretty healthy at like $4 billion -- actually $4.3 billion off of a record comp the previous year and as a referenced pipeline, the orders pipeline at this point is about $1 billion higher than a year ago, which I think is quite informative as well.
Having said all that, you put ingredients all into the blender. We expect total backlog comparable to slightly up off of a record last year. So all in all, I feel pretty good about it. The linearity is a little lumpy and bumpy given the accelerated supply lead times that improved dramatically in Q2. But overall, it's pretty good. And George, you're right. as Q2, we did have 2 significant product-related orders. The combination of Current County, California, as well as Ukraine order, we're almost $200 million in that quarter, 2 sizable significant deals in last year's comp. Good point. Got it. And then I assume really no impact from M&A or FX on backlog? FX was fairly de minimis? And then M&A, I assume, also de minimis? Yes. Yes, exactly. The next question is from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. I guess just first one for me. Gross margins in the quarter tracked a lot better than as anticipated? And if I look historically, you've been able to expand margins from 2Q levels through the year. But I guess if my math is right on the guide, it would imply a bit more of a muted cadence than what we've typically seen. Can you maybe just help us understand what is [indiscernible] that and whether there's anything under the hood in 2Q that we should be appreciating as an outlier? And then I have a follow-up. Sure. So within the first half -- at operating margin, I'll start there. We're pleased with our margin performance. We saw good growth on supplier lead times improving pretty significantly during the quarter and really in the first half as well. And we talked about on the call that at operating margin, we'll see 100 bps of expansion on the year, that's up from 75%.
Within the mix, gross margins will remain comparable, and we'll continue to invest in OpEx whereby now the -- for the year, with the acquisitions that we've announced, our OpEx envelope is expected to be about $130 million more than last year. So good progress on operating margin expansion and healthy gross margins to help drive that. Got it. I appreciate the color there, Jason. And then maybe for my follow-up, and this is a bit of a big picture one, but you talked about the [indiscernible] installed base and specifically the opportunity to address most services opportunity there. Curious if you could parse that out a bit more? And how big of an opportunity that could be for Motorola to better monetize that installed base that you have? And how do you see that materializing over time. And maybe just Lastly, and maybe this is a silly question, but like, is this an area where you could potentially acquire? Or is that just far fetched given your position and or other variables? Yes. So big picture from a services standpoint, I think we've got growth opportunities in a number of different facets, number one, cyber, our networks, particularly the public safety P25 networks in the United States Canada and certain countries abroad. We've got opportunities and our customers have asked us to step up in that capacity.
The second piece of it is just a scope -- just general scope increases across the board globally. The third piece of it is that we manage various networks. We're in discussions right now with 2 different European countries and a network in South America that we manage for extensions. And to every one of those, it's not apples for apples. It's usually apples plus something. So we're encouraged by the opportunities in front of us from a services standpoint. I think it's relatively rare -- the last one we did on the services side was TETRA Ireland. We always look for opportunities there. Obviously, that's of interest. That's our power alley and what we do well in provisioning and delivering and own and operating LMR networks. There could be an opportunity or 2, but we'll see. But I -- they're more -- they're not typically run rate or every year. They're every few years an opportunity. The only other thing I'd add is just on these managed service networks -- those -- we don't typically just look at those through the lens of LMR. Those actually provide us a platform to go and do things like body worn as a service within national police agencies as well. [indiscernible] video contracts that we're looking to start to provide as a service as well. So there's a little bit of a flywheel effect when we get those service opportunities. The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Greg, I just wanted to maybe touch on the product revenue growth trajectory from here. If I look at the guidance, obviously, this has been a very, very strong segment for multiple years now. We're going to start getting into the mid- to high single digits in Q4, if my math is right, trying to back into this. .
And I know that you'll give a greater look into 2025 on the next call typically. But as I kind of try to map out the trajectory of product revenue growth, do you see a scenario where we're potentially going to have more of a soft landing? Or do you think there could be a greater digestion or growth could end up turning negative beyond Q4? Yes. Look, I would say this, kind of stepping back, the demand, the orders pipeline, the backlog, state and local funding, which is good and looks to be good again in 2025, the continued funding environment at the federal level. I mean, Adam, there's a lot of variables here, device refresh systems and services scope. Love the growth, as Jason referenced, we raised it for LMR from mid- to mid- to high that's informing the full year raise to approximately 8%. And I see continued runway here.
Now you're right, we're obviously not going to talk about 2025. Q2 was particularly strong again because component supply drove improved lead times faster than we thought. We still, Adam, expect continued products growth in the second half of the year. So look, I like the way the business is running, and I -- but not just for the quarter, I like the momentum we have for the balance of this year, and we'll see what happens next year. But I really like the position we're in. and we'll probably give you some color, high level, on the next quarter as you referenced to inform 2025. Got it. That's helpful and fair. Maybe just as a follow-up on the increased adoption of cloud in video and command center, and I think we might have Mahesh on the call and in case he wants to weigh in. But I'd be curious what is driving the tipping point to really inflect that adoption now? Also how you would evaluate the competitive environment and Motorola's differentiation in the cloud portion versus the non-cloud portion?
And then lastly -- I'm sorry, this is a multi parter how the financials are impacted in a cloud sale versus a non-cloud sale? Are we in a situation where we might have some cannibalization or change to financials if this happens? Sure, Adam. To begin with, I think one of the reasons why which one has historically been strong is because of we offer an end-to-end solution, which is video plus access control tightly integrated. And that end-to-end solution in many ways, gets amplified with a cloud story. It's one where the installation, the configuration, and the ability to deploy with the least amount of hardware bids on site become that much more attractive. So we see that as one of the reasons why starting with our smaller customers, but now very quickly going into much larger installations as well, we see a preference and a drift towards the cloud.
And then on top of that, there are also capabilities AI services and additional capabilities that we're able to deliver the cloud to augment what we already do at the edge, and that's also a motivator here as well.
So that's -- I'd say that's in many ways, one of the things that's driving that -- the cloud growth, which, as Greg already said, while software, video software itself is growing at 24%, cloud software, very specifically actually [indiscernible] growing even faster. Yes. And I think that the growth rate -- the strong cloud adoption of what we call Avigilon Alta, which is the cloud version, Avigilon Unity being prem is a reflection of the success of the Open Path acquisition and Aveva and the successful integration for combined video and access control under the cloud with Mahesh's leadership and Alex Kazerani. So part of the other ""[ new infection ]"" point of our continued growth is the successful not only acquisitions, but the integration and the yield and the benefits associated with our cloud platform. I think the team is doing quite well. The only thing I'd add, Adam, is our Cloud Connector is a differentiator with our customers. It enables our customers to keep their cameras and move to cloud VMS, it's a great point. It's not a closed system. And I think that's a big value proposition differentiator between us and our cloud competition. You're right, Jack. [indiscernible] I think unlike many of our competitors in this space, our direct-to-cloud cameras are actually standards compliant. And they don't get locked out if that access is not present. Adam, the second question -- part of your question you had to go with the financial model. it was actually the third question, but go ahead. Both on-prem and cloud for us are solid business models. They're value propositions to customers. Of course, we've planned for the $40 million impact of the cloud acceleration that's on track. And both have a good margin structure. And as you know, cloud comes with the stickiness with the term license that upon renewal leads to even greater renewal. So we're pleased with both models. The next question is from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Jason, I wanted to go back to the product gross margin. If you exclude mix from the discussion, where would you say you are on the progress with respect to reducing the [ BOM ] supply chain efforts, any logistics optimization. What have you seen? What are your thoughts on where you're at and what might be left there? Yes. So we mentioned that supply continues to improve and did so in Q2. If I think about the financial benefits that we are planning for and are showing up, we talked about the year's guide included when we opened in February about having about a $60 million improvement in cost relative to semiconductors and PPV. We're actually on a year basis, probably trending closer to $70 million. And by the way, that benefits is in both first half and second half. So we're seeing the benefit of prices as well as premiums coming down. .
In terms of product or mix, we continue to see favorable mix. We see volume growth complemented by mix. Both are helpful in terms of the growth drivers you've seen. And then last one for me. Greg or Jack, could you remind us on the overall mix of within backlog, what you see from commercial and public safety and how you would -- just remind us on the integrity of those orders versus maybe a more traditionally enterprise-focused order? Yes. The backlog composition is almost 95% government direct. Why that's important is our direct sales force, it's a clean line of sight to that backlog, and it's not the channel. And given the funding vehicles and procurements within government, governments order according to their prioritization and they issue a PO to a company like us directly, they don't subsequently order from someone else. So -- and we are fulfilling that backlog. And our backlog, as Jack mentioned, 95% plus comes from our public safety direct customers. The next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. This is actually Erwin Lu on for Amit. I wanted to double-click on the international business. I think overall growth in Q2 was mid-single digits, and that was a deceleration versus a quarter ago. And this is all excluding any sort of U.K. home office impact. Any sense on how the overall macro and/or demand backdrop for international compares versus North American. In the longer term, should we expect international mix to expand as a percentage of total? I think we think international is a great opportunity. I mean if you think about it, it's up single digits in Q2 outside of the home office. There's really 3 things, we've got -- within Europe, very large managed and support service business there. We've just announced a new device, as Greg alluded to early being the MXP 660, which not only elongates our customers' investment in that managed support service that brings another opportunity from a device standpoint.
Australia continues to be a market that we performed quite well. But the other piece, there's 2 other elements within our video business, we've talked about it before, but mobile video, we compete exceedingly well. Mahesh's team has brought -- recently brought out new device to market another VP device. We talked about Scotland. We've got great opportunities both within the government space, but also in the enterprise space outside of the United States.
So international continues to be a great market. We've got great leadership there. And I feel -- I think we all collectively feel really good about opportunities for growth. And I know, Amit, and you and team know this, but just to remind everybody, our international revenues over -- almost 75% of them come from EMEA, Australia and New Zealand. That's our strength. That's where we build networks. That's where we have flywheels of growth, and that -- those are great markets for us for Jack and his team. . Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, I also wanted to just get an update on the U.K. home office. I'm not sure if there's anything new to report versus a quarter ago. But can you just walk us through a range of potential outcomes? There's actually one new point from a quarter ago, and that is just -- it's a good question to level set, you know the dispute, it's been ongoing. It's been several years. We [ believe ] the CMA ruling was unfounded. We think it's disproportionate. We think it's unprecedented. You've heard us talk about that. We appealed that. We lost. So we appealed to the Competition Appeals Tribunal and we lost. So the only last option as it relates to this dispute, on the imposition of the charge control was the U.K. Court of Appeal, which is their highest court in the U.K. And the noteworthy item is they decided to hear the case. So that's a new development. That hearing is November 11 and 12, impossible to predict what that is, but that is something that's new from when we talked about this a quarter ago. .
I just want to remind you that as it relates for Q2, the rest of this year, the full year of this year, we are operating under kind of the draconian disproportionately excessive discount. So that's -- we're raising the full year inclusive of kind of that worst-case charge control for this year.
What happens in the future? Don't know. I am pleased that the U.K. Court of Appeal will give this the appropriate audience and review, and we'll see where it goes from there. The next question is from the line of Rodney McFall with North Coast Research. So I was wondering if you could provide some color on the customer transition to more premium versions of APX NEXT radios. Have they been receptive? And then, just any color on -- in terms of the premium on price compared to legacy versions of the product? I guess from an experience standpoint, we've gotten  very positive reviews. We've had multiple large-scale police departments that have made the transition to APX NEXT and the APX NEXT family. The first thing is we contemplate one of the things we always think about when we develop product disease of use. I think we nailed that. The LTE capabilities enable them to get radios programmed and refleeted I don't want to say instantaneously, but was something that took them weeks and months can now be done in a day, which is a positive thing. It also gives them the capability to extend the network coverage. And what we've seen is a phenomenon is we've got a lot of customers that have mixed fleets and enables those transitions to happen as well.
Last but not least, we talk about our command center business, but the APX NEXT and its ability to put through higher bandwidth workflows is also very complementary to our Command Central suite -- our Command Central Suite Sweet rather. So we think we've heard really positive things. As Greg and Jason articulated, about 25% of those devices that will ship this year, our APX NEXT. So we are in a multiyear phenomenon as it relates to the upgrade. Our next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. I'm following up on the several questions regarding the LMR product strength. Should we expect the year-over-year growth rate for the LMR product line to be volatile? Or is this mid-teens level durable. And going deeper, are customers upgrading their radios on the normal 6- to 7-year upgrade cycle? Or are the features for APX and APX NEXT so compelling that many customers are upgrading early to get the LTE and the programmable devices, which may be driving an acceleration? So a couple of things. Just, Louie, to ground you, the 15% kind of pop the clutch LMR product growth in Q2 was a reflection of lead times, components supply lead times that improved quicker than we thought. So that's why the exceptionally strong 15% [ print ] in Q2. .
Secondly, for the annual year-over-year growth rate, we're saying it's mid- to high single digits for LMR. Up from mid, I think that, that improvement is in part because of continued strong traction with devices. I do think -- you're right. I think on average, it's about an 8-year plus or minus device renewal or refresh. I think that's still in the ZIP code as it relates to a North America refresh. But I'll give you an anecdote.
I was at a large city last week with a senior commander and spent some time with him, and he had his APX NEXT, I had no idea he would have that. He had his APX NEXT device on his desk when we were talking, I said, what do you think of that? And I know this sounds anecdotal and a self-promotion. It's just -- it's really not. He talked about what Jack referenced, the over-the-air reprogramming, having a control channel that you can hear everything about it. the video display capability, the LTE, along with LMR, the adoption rate and the acceptance and the feature functionality that, that device brings, which allows us to price for value is -- has been really, really good. And we're just getting started in the European and international market with the brand-new MX 660, which think of that as the APX NEXT equivalent for Europe and beyond.
So I think, look, I love the position we're in. We have thousands of installed networks. We're monetizing the services. As Jack talked about, with expanding scope. We're upselling things like cybersecurity. And it's a really good situation. And I think that I like the hand we have. Great. And in the past, Greg and Jason, you've provided cumulative APX NEXT orders, have you guys passed the $1 billion mark, in terms of your cumulative APX NEXT orders? Talking about orders, we used to reference cumulative orders... I think the more important metric that we've shared is that this year, our APX devices total revenues less than 1/4 of those will come from the APX NEXT family. So Jack and team are still selling a very good APX radio. Our customers expect it. They don't like forced migrations. They want graceful migrations. And Jack's point about mixed fleets evidence is that.
So we have a long way ahead of us. And in the almost $2 billion of devices that will do for public safety, less than 25% of them are in to come this year from APX NEXT The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. . Great. Maybe as a first question, just in terms of a lot of the acquisitions you've done over the past year. Where are you in terms of integration of those acquisitions? Or are you kind of integration of those teams in order to kind of get better leverage across the platform or across the customer base? Maybe that's the first question. Yes, I'll let Mahesh since the acquisitions are primarily in video and Commander, maybe you could speak to the integration progress. Sure. And maybe just to start out where, Greg, you left off with Ulta. So Alta was our brand for Open Path and [ AVA ], which is effectively our cloud-based access control solution and our cloud-based video management solution, both being critical to our portfolio. Both under Alex Kazerani were brought together as Alta. And now we are able to integrate the capabilities of both access control and video I think in fairly unique and powerful ways, ones that our customers are really appreciating and evidenced by the uptake in the market.
Beyond that, Rave would be the other big piece here and Rave is one of those critical elements that's a glue between public safety and enterprise security, and Rave integrated, not just with 911 and CAD solutions, but also integrated with our enterprise security solutions, effectively video, both Alta and Unity. I think that plays a fairly significant role. And we're seeing that impact of that ecosystem going forward as well.
Pelco, we rationalized our video management platforms into one with the on-prem solution being the Unity video management solution. And our camera platforms across all our brands really operate on basically a shared infrastructure with the best of many things that each brand brought into the table, integrated and offered across the board.
So I think that's that speaks to some of the key integration examples. Silent sentinel is well on its way right now. And as [ Noggin ] comes into play here, which has incident management, which is a key piece of the puzzle for us. [ Noggin ] will complement both our fixed video portfolio, but it will also complement Rave quite nicely as well. I think just -- the only thing I'd add to that, Meta, the only thing I'd add is, when I think about this company and look back over the last several years, I do think that M&A and successful acquisition financially from an accretion standpoint, and a strategic impact standpoint and our ability to integrate and retain talent. Mahesh's Exhibit A, Alex Kazerani, the CEO of OpenPath, Todd Piett, the CEO of Rave, not just retaining them, but having them in contributory senior executive roles that can facilitate and drive integration in addition to the competencies within core Motorola, I'm really pleased. I think it's going quite well. Great. Maybe piggybacking on that answer. Just how are you guys thinking about capital allocation just given that M&A has been such a successful part of the strategy? Well, we got off to a fast start in the first half of this year with effectively a little over $700 million in share repurchase and the convert on the Silver Lake settlement, which is great. Nick the Silver Lake settlement, memory tells me was like 33.14 share. We did 71 million of share repurchases in Q2 at 348 and change. So I always like the way we deploy capital, I think, pretty thoughtfully and opportunistically against the discounted share -- the discounted cash flow and the value of the company going forward. And we've now done 40 acquisitions, plus or minus over the last 9 or 10 years. We just completed 2 that we referenced in Q2. And to your point, Meta, the M&A funnel is attractive.
So we will be opportunistic along deploying that $2.25 billion of operating cash flow 55% of share repo or acquisitions fungible between the two with 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. So we're well on our way. And I like -- and by the way, I like deploying the capital internally in R&D, too. So $850 million of R&D is giving us the widest and broadest product portfolio through 3 technologies with land mobile radio, video and command center which is, in turn, powering a unique competitive differentiating safety and security ecosystem.
So when I think about the deployment of capital organically, I like the returns. When I think about returning it to the shareholder and the value we've created and the float that we've contracted, I like that. And when I look at the opportunities ahead potentially for acquisition, I'm optimistic about some opportunities that may present themselves. [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from the line of Tomer Zilberman of Bank of America. I wanted to touch on some questions that were asked earlier, but maybe ask them a little bit differently in the video security portfolio, specifically the product portion, you've been growing that roughly mid-single digits over the last few quarters. Are you comfortable with that growth going forward? Or do you expect that to reaccelerate to hit your overall 12% growth for that segment? Well, when I look back at the -- to your point, the previous few quarters, we're in the ZIP code of product video performance. So I like that consistency. The most important is really talking about market share. And we gained market share last year in video security and access control is a category. We expect to gain market share again this year. The fact that the growth rate is much higher in cloud as we signaled earlier, I think, is great. And the product video performance quarter-to-quarter, I think, is fine in the ZIP code and against the backdrop of the overall market growth. So I like where we are, and I like the continued execution. Also, keep in mind, this is an end-to-end systems or solutions business and customers buy the entirety of the portfolio from us products, software, services, and some of the areas we've made investments are in software. So whether it's cloud, whether it's analytics, services and/or mobile video, those are some of the investments we've made. And so to see software growing faster than products is commensurate to that. Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, moving to your implied 4Q guidance. So the implied EPS came in a few cents short of Street expectations. Just curious as to your thoughts on the margin set up as we go into the second half of the year, especially 4Q? So with the raise on the year and the higher volumes, offset by a few dilutive cents from the acquisitions we've made the raise is the performance of Q2 as well as the acquisitions, reflecting the 8% total growth. Yes. I mean we passed through the beat in Q2. And obviously, that informs the full year raise pretty nicely. But also there's -- M&A is slightly dilutive of a couple of cents as well, but we like the position we're in. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. Yes. I just want to say thank you for everybody listening on the call. Obviously, thank you for everybody joining the call. But also thanks for all the Motorola Solutions people and our channel partners and our distributors worldwide appreciate everything you've done for an exceptional quarter. And probably more important than the quarter is the momentum at that quarter -- this quarter informs for the back half of the year and how we'd like to finish the year strong.
I think I think our solving for safer narrative continues to resonate and gain traction. I think that's representative in the results. The customer prioritization for putting an emphasis and a priority on safety and security I think, is self-evident. And as I mentioned, the orders pipeline is up pretty significantly from a period ago. At this point last year, referenced about $1 billion.
So -- and finally, I think as I've been asked about capital allocation, I like the strength of our balance sheet. I like the fact that our operating cash flow is expected to grow double digits again for the second year in a row. And look, I think the performance of the business, the organic investment, the acquisitions and the firepower of the balance sheet. Look, I think it provides us good flexibility to continue to execute and drive shareholder value going forward. And I appreciate everybody on what you're doing and how you're helping onward and upward, and I appreciate everything you've done. This does conclude today's teleconference.
