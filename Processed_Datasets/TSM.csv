As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the podium to our CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. Can you all hear me okay? Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
My presentation will start with the first quarter highlights and followed by the second quarter guidance. In the first quarter, due to seasonality, our first quarter revenue in US dollars decreased 8.2% sequentially to USD 8.46 billion, which was at the middle of our guidance range. The NT dollars revenue declined 10.6%, reflecting 2.7% appreciation in NT dollar against U.S. dollar. Gross margin increased 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 50.3%. As our cost improvement efforts and inventory valuation benefit offset the lower-capacity utilization in unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expense decreased by TWD 2.1 billion and represented 10.8% of revenue versus 10.4% in the prior quarter. Thus, operating margin slightly decreased 0.2 percentage points to 39.0%. Overall, our first quarter EPS reached TWD 3.46, and ROE was 23% for the quarter.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the first quarter, Communication and Industrial/Standard decreased 19% and 4% from the prior quarter, respectively, while Computer and Consumer increased by 30% and 9%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at our revenue by technologies. 10-nanometer process technology contributed 19% of our total wafer revenue in the first quarter, the combined 16/20 contribution was 22% of total wafer revenue, 28-nanometer and below advanced technologies accounted for 61% of total wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 684 billion, an increase of TWD 35 billion from last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 16 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 2 days to 42 days. Days of inventory increased 11 days to 63 days due to an increase of raw wafer and the 10-nanometer wafer previewed before the capacity is converted to 7-nanometer.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and the CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 161 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 72 billion in capital expenditures. So our free cash flow was TWD 89 billion. We also repaid TWD 17 billion of corporate bonds and the prepaid TWD 34 billion of corporate bonds and interest. As a result, our overall cash balance increased TWD 24 billion to reach TWD 578 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar term, our first quarter CapEx expenditure was $2.45 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let me turn on to the second quarter guidance. Based on current business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be between USD 7.8 billion and USD 7.9 billion, which is a 7% to 8% sequential decline, but a 11.2% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of my revenue guidance.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 29.20, our second quarter gross margin is expected to be between 47% and 49%. Our second quarter operating margin is expected to be between 35% and 37%. Also, in the second quarter, we will again need to accrue the 10% tax on the undistributed retained earnings. But due to higher accumulative translation loss as a result of anti-appreciation against U.S. dollars, which will reduce our retained earning tax. Therefore, our second quarter tax rate will be between 18% to 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 10% to 11% level in the third and the fourth quarter, and a full year tax rate will be about 12%.
This concludes my remarks, and I will now make comments on capital capacity and the profitability. I will start with CapEx and capacity. At our last conference, we stated our 2018 CapEx budget to be between USD 10.5 billion to USD 11 billion. We now see our CapEx to be between USD 11.5 billion and USD 12 billion. The increase is due to: number one, we plan to spend about $500 million more to increase our mask-making capacity to support our customers higher tape-out activities; and to spend about $300 million as prepayment for our high-end EUV tools.
Going forward, we expect our annual CapEx in the next few years will be ranging between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion. Now let me explain how we are able to support our 5% to 10% long-term growth with a similar level of annual CapEx as the follows. For the existing capacity, we are able to grow capacity through productivity improvement, that is, for the same tours, the output can increase every year through our engineering efforts and innovations. This way, without spending fresh CapEx, we are able to grow capacity to support growth. On average, we are able to grow our overall capacity by the mid-single digit each year through the productivity improvement. Our marketing strategy with respect to the existing capacities, which grow in productivity perpetually, is to seek enough demand to feel this growing capacity at all times. As for the new capacity which is mainly leading-age technologies, we are very careful in planning the right level of PIC capacity, knowing that initial capacity we build will grow continuously to a larger size due to productivity improvement.
To summarize, through productivity improvement and careful planning of new capacity, we are able to support revenue growth of 5% to 10% with annual CapEx at a USD 10 billion to USD 12 billion level in the next few years.
Now let me make a comment on profitability. TSMC's profitability is determined by the following factors: leadership technology, development and ramp-up, pricing, capacity utilization, cost reduction, foreign exchange rate and technology mix.
Now I will go through the changes for our second quarter gross margin compared to second quarter '17 and first quarter '18, respectively. Compare second quarter '18 gross margin using the midpoint of the guidance I just mentioned, which will be 48%, compare that with second quarter '17 gross margin, which was 50.8%. The decline of 2.8 percentage points gross margin rate is explained by 1.3 percentage point negatively due to exchange rate. NT dollars has appreciated 3.6% from second quarter '17 to second quarter '18. In addition to that, there is a negative 1.5 percentage point due to unfavorable product mix and inventory valuation, which is resulting from a utilization change. If I compare second quarter '18 with first quarter '18, where our margin was 50.3% last quarter, the decline of 2.3 percentage point gross margin is explained mainly by the favorable 2 percentage point of inventory valuation that was embedded in the first quarter '18 gross margin, which I have explained in the last quarterly conference.
To conclude, our leadership in technology development and ramp-up remains solid. We continue to maintain our competitive price, and we are making good progress in cost reduction. We will continue to work on feeding our capacity. I finished my remark.
Now let me turn the microphone to C.C. Wei for his comment. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 248.1 billion or USD 8.46 billion in line with our guidance given 3 months ago. This result was mainly driven by a strong demand from high-performance computing such as cryptocurrency mining and increases from both automotive and IoT, but offset by seasonal decline in smartphones.
Moving into second quarter this year. Our business is expected to be affected by continued softer demand from Smartphone segment. This decline is expect to be partially mitigated by the strengths in HPC. Our revenue in US dollar is likely to grow by only about a 10% over second quarter last year. We forecast our fabless DOI to stay slightly above seasonal level, but will attract seasonal pattern. For the whole year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow by 5%, while foundry expect to grow by about a 8%. We forecast TSMC's 2018 revenue in US dollar will be about a 10%, rather than the previously indicated 10% to 15% due to the Smartphone weakness and the uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining demand.
Now let me talk about the long-term business growth driver. We are optimistic about the development of some of the industries of mega trends, particularly AI and 5G communication. We believe these 2 will help semiconductor to separate is progressively seem to our daily lives. Both AI and 5G will create the new usage models and spur new waves of demand for both of the existing and emerging applications with the increasing silicon content. We expect TSMC to benefit from these industry mega trends in all 4 of our gross platforms. In mobile, silicon content of the smartphones were increased due to increasing functionality such as facial recognition and new usage such as AR, VR and 3D video. In HPC, we expect AI will boost the attach rate of accelerators using data center for today's mid- to teens level to about 50% by 2020. In automotive, the use of the new safety-related functionalities such as ADAS and eventually autonomous driving will drive the increasing silicon usage. In IoT, AI will proliferate into broad-based current devices across many applications, such as the smart voice assistance or electronics appliance management. These, again, will increase silicon content. We believe our 4 growth platform are well positioned to benefit from the longer-term mega trend of AI and 5G. Our leadership in advance and specialty technologies as well as our advanced packaging solutions should enable us to capture the future growth opportunities well.
Now let me talk about the N7 ramp-up. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology in terms of performance, power and area density as well as its schedule is leading the industry. So far, we have already favored out more than 18 customer products with good yield in performance. More than 50 products tape-outs has been planned by end of this year from applications across mobile, server CPU, network processor, gaming, GPU, PGA, cryptocurrency, automotive and AI. Our 7-nanometer is already in volume production.
Now I'll talk about the N7+ and EUV. We believe we can extend the success of our 7-nanometer. N7 too is enhanced version. N7+, which will have 20% better density and greater than 10% power reduction.
And N7+ will use few EUV layers to replace emerging decacore processor. As a result, fewer [indiscernible] layer can be used. As the N7+ will use more than 90% of the same tours with the N7 and N10, where we have fine tune all the advanced equipment to their optimum condition during their ramp-up, we believe we can leverage our production learning to N7+ and enjoy the industry's best deeper density among competitors of comparable technologies. Our N7+ silicon result today are very encouraging. Not only we have demonstrated equivalent or better performance in yield on both 256-megabit SRAM and on product like test vehicle when compared to N7 baseline, we have also demonstrated a tighter distribution of electrical parameters in the areas, where EUV is supplied. Since we maximize design [rule] compatibility between N7 and N7+, our customer can minimize the IP porting effect -- effort, I'm sorry. A few customers have already planned to tape out the N7+ resource in second half this year and more in the first half next year. Our N7+ volume production is planned in 2019, which remain unchanged. We have made ready multiple EUV scanners to support not only N7+ development but also N5 development. At N5, with more extensive use of EUV, we have obtained consistent double-digit yield on 256-megabit SRAM as well as our larger test chip. Our silicon data has proved or the benefits we expect from process simplification with EUV. Besides the silicon development, EUV technology continue to mature toward a high volume production with the improving source power toward the 250-watts goal, which we expect to achieve in a few quarters. Good progress continue to be made in the EUV infrastructure in the last few months. They include photoresist, mask defect in yield, pellicle defects in transmission. We are confident that EUV can meet our goal of 2019 volume production for N7+ and 2020 volume production for N5.
Now let me move to 16-FinFET and 12-FinFET. We introduced our 16-FinFET in 2015 and then 12FFC in 2017. Compared with the 16-nanometer, our 12-nanometer technology deliver better density, performance and more efficient power. With continual improvement in yield, customer are gradually moving from 16-nanometer to 12-nanometer.
Among all the product tape-outs we received for this year on the 16/12 node, about 30% are for 12FFC. The application of 16/12 includes mobile, GPU, AI, networking FPGA, consumer application and automotive. Our capacity of 12/16 node is being fully loaded currently.
Now let me update on Nanjing fab. We expect to expand our business in China. Our Nanjing fab will enhance our support to local customers. Because of high demand on 16-nanometer, we had advanced the startup of Nanjing production. The production of our Nanjing plant starts this month. Both yield and performance are comparable to our 16-nanometer Taiwan fab. Our advanced packaging -- now let me talk about the last item. Our advanced packaging technology, InFO and CoWoS, are becoming more important for our customer to reduce their product footprint, packaging techniques while enhancing the performance. TSMC's InFO is surreal of volume production. We have expanded its capability to cover large die size so that we can integrate 2 or more chips together into 1 package. This is particularly useful for HPC product to obtain optimum cost performance benefit. And CoWoS, we have observed a growing number of tape-outs from HPC customers in graphic and networking segment. As a result, we are increasing our capacity now to support the demand. And thank you for your attention. All right. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answer your question. [Operator Instructions] So Mark will host the Q&A session.
The first question will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. I want to ask the first question about the demand and pricing environment. Just first on pricing. In first quarter, the shipments were down just 1% and revenue was down 8%. I'm curious if that's mainly the mix factor because 10 fell off, or if there's any change in pricing maybe on some of the more mature notes? And then if you could talk a bit more on the demand change versus what you've seen in January, how much from Smartphone? And then from the crypto, you talked about uncertainty, how much is coming from that market? And what are the uncertainty factors you're seeing on the crypto market? Yes. Lora, please. Randy, your question is about the first quarter versus fourth quarter, quantity versus pricing. It is true that the first quarter pricing was affected by the product mix because we have very high utilization on the 16- and 10-nanometer, and that's the case. I think Randy also has a part of the question about the changing our forecast compared to January. Okay. C.C., about the product mix? The product mix, actually the first quarter, we just mentioned weakness of a seasonality, actually. Let me say that Smartphones and all other segment actually stop -- continue to grow, okay, in the HPC, automotive, IoT. However, that our revenue, a lot of portion is around Smartphone. So that's why we have a mixed effect in the technology. Our smartphone use most leading-edge technology, and that's why a few percentage drop -- a bit drop in the revenue. And the second part of that question and I have -- the second question was just about the crypto, if you could talk a bit more about the uncertainties? And if you've seen that sustained? Or you're seeing more uncertainties? So just the factors you're seeing in that market. And then the second question I have is on 7-nanometer plus. If you could discuss how you're seeing that ramp in terms of steepness at this stage relative to -- we've seen steep ramps of 10 and 16 before, if you're seeing steep ramp going into 7 plus? And also just how important it is to have a steep ramp? So in terms of -- how important it is to have that steep ramp just in terms of the learning as you try to bring customers onto EUV? So how important is it to have a big volume ramp on 7 plus? 7 plus ramp? For your EUV development? Okay. Let me answer that. It's cryptocurrency. We see a very strong demand in the first quarter from cryptocurrency and -- in the first quarter. So during this second quarter, this is start of the second quarter, we see some weakness on 28-nanometer, but the rest of the technology is still very strong on cryptocurrency. Does your second question is on the 7 plus ramp? Yes. It's -- yes, 2 parts, it's how steep you're seeing? Or how much demand inflection are you seeing for 7 plus? And how important is it to TSMC to have a wide adoption in terms of the learning to move customers on 7 plus in terms of learning as you look at 5 and even against your competitors? 7 plus, we -- I mentioned, we are using a few layers of EUV. And the EUV's progress is very well, so our customers start to adopt it. And how important? It's important. And we expect that N7+ will start to ramp up in the second half of next year quickly. Actually, it's ramping up quickly because of Smartphone business. I think 7 plus, we have EUV development, as C.C. just addressed, progress mostly, and we have demonstrated 7 plus yield equivalent to 7. So the rest is volume. But I think the volume is -- we don't need a huge volume to prove EUV because all the development is in place, and the biggest volume ramp will be in N5, which is 2020, already in 2019 have some small volume. And N7+ will slightly prelude that but we don't need as bigger volume to enable the N5. No, we just need some volume to prove that. N7+ provide better density, better performance for our N7 customer following their N7 products, either they want to stay on N7, go to N7+ or they can from N7 go to N5, depend on their product needs. Next question will be coming from Deutsche Bank, Michael Chou. First question is regarding your revised guidance for 2018. So can we say you will still have the same 7-nanometer sales ratio target this year, 10%? 10% gross? Yes, around 10%. Around 10%. Yes. So it's still the same outlook as we -- as you expected 3 month ago? It's -- as I said, Smartphone, it will be weak. So continue to be soft that we predicted other day. So it's -- they're all dealing -- the 7-nanometers, it's a little bit 1 point of. Okay. So is that fair to say 7-nanometer sales portion may be slightly below your previous target? Or you still think this should be close to 10%? Very close. Okay. Second question is regarding your structural profitability. Do you think this year your structural profitability will improve or be the same as last year? I have said several points that associated with structural profitability, technology, pricing, cost, capacity utilization, exchange rate and product mix. On this, there are certain things we can control. Number one, foreign exchange, we cannot control. Product mix always go with the customers' demand. So while we have seen some weakness in the first half for the mobile and there are certain technology of our existing customer capacity maybe not so full for the whole year and that will be one factor to our overall structural profitability. But I think our objective to maintain or improve structural profitability remain unchanged, but there are market situation and some uncertainty we have to be mindful. So is that fair to say your biggest uncertainty will be FX rather than the other factors? FX at least explain half of the deviation of our profitability. The other fair half, I think, it's mainly utilization, product mix and other factors. So is that fair to say your 28-nanometer UTR slightly below your expectation? So that could lead to some margin downside? It could. Next question will be coming from Sinolink's [ Andrew Lu ]. [Foreign Language] Last time I came back, year 2010, Morris, the chairman give me 3 question to ask. Can I get this exception? You have 2. Okay. The second quarter guidance or full year guidance, is this factoring the ZTE recently been banned by U.S. to sale the chip to ZTE? Is this factor in into your model? That's my first question. The second half this year? Almost second quarter. Second quarter. Second half also as well. No, we haven't. The news just -- we got the just -- news just yesterday. But we think the effect is very, very minimal. Currently, we are still under study what is the impact of ZTE suppliers, but for first glance that we look at, we have a very wide customer portfolio. So ZTE depends what they're supplied from, and we have -- being everyone's foundry, we have very widespread. So I think the impact will be softened much, much more. Much -- so we think that minimal impact on second quarter. You won't see the number change. You're going to see... Which quarter, sorry? Second quarter you're talking about. Yes. Okay. The second question I have -- okay, in terms of cash dividend, I estimate every year, we got additional $2 billion to $3 billion additional cash, even though we pay a lot of cash dividend, and are we going to give a much higher payout ratio compared to in the past few years? Because even this year, by factoring the new cash dividend, we still generate additional cash. So right now, I think it's over $20 billion on-hand cash already. So we are -- keep going out every year $2 billion to $3 billion. So that's my question. We have said many times our dividend policy to be sustainable and gradually increase dividend. We haven't really tied to a payout ratio per se, but we do look at free cash flow generation next 12 months, next 24 months. We use that as a basis to decide how much more dividend we are going to gradually increase. So it's $20 billion to date, and I have said, the CapEx will be $10 billion to $12 billion. We do have a capability in the future to increase a little bit more than we have been increasing in the past. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. First question is, C.C., to use their [indiscernible] led 10-nanometer total revenue will continue to grow this year? The answer is yes. Okay. So for 10-nanometer to continue to grow on top of this 10% year-on-year revenue growth and 7-nanometer around 10% growth from scratch. So both 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer probably total contribute more than 10% of the total growth this year. So does that mean that for 20-nanometer and 40-nanometer and above technology that total revenue is not going to grow? Is that right? You are doing a very good mathematic calculation. I don't want to comment on that. Okay. So what's the reason for this 28-nanometer and the 40-nanometer and above does not grow? Does that because that [indiscernible] is soft? Or is this due to the capacity constraint? Or we are losing market share to... I would say that a lot of 28-nanometers usage has been advancing to the more advanced note -- moved to more advanced note. So the utilization definitely is not what we expected last year. But all I can say is, we remain very competitive, and we are developing some derivative technology to serve all the customer. We move into the 22-nanometers to hear our customer can get a very good cost performance benefit, and we are maintaining our market segment share. Okay. But last year actually, we also expanded about 15% to 20% of the capacity for 28-nanometer. So is there any problem to fulfill the capacity this year? Last year, we increased the capacity because of a very high demand. And a lot of customer did not hit in that wafer. That continue into this year's first quarter and probably half of this quarter. But at the end, they move forward faster than we thought. So that's why that we see a little bit weakness in the second half. Okay. So are we going to -- how are we going to utilize this new added capacity? We have a lot of new application being developed, and trust me that one day, you will be fully loaded again. I hope, it's as quickly as possible, but technology product development takes time. Okay. For -- second question is for Nanjing fab, now we are already started [indiscernible] and we have 20,000 wafer per month capacity. So is there any plan to further expand the capacity in Nanjing fab? 20,000 wafer per month is still our plan. We plan for this year all the way to next year. But we ramp up so quickly, actually it surprised us. Okay. For the further capacity expansion in Nanjing, are we going to buy the new equipment? Or are we going to continue allocating from Taiwan? We probably still at the first phase is still moving the equipment from Taiwan. First phase means the 20,000? Is... Yes, majority of 20,000. So that is ongoing? Or that is already done? Is 20,000 capacity moved... Okay. Let me give you an idea. We are fully loaded, so I cannot move any equipment right now. Anything we move will lost the capacity. Next question will be coming from UBS, Will Lu. First question is for Lora. Lora talked about productivity improvements leading to mid-single-digit capacity increases. So 2-part question. One is, is that capacity increase pretty even across all the mature notes? Or is it certain notes that you're seeing bigger increase? Second part of the question is that mid-single digit going forward, what was that number in the past? I didn't hear your second question, sorry. If you look at productivity improvements in the past, what has that number been? Okay. Let me elaborate about productivity. As you can imagine, when the new technology just launch, in the first few years, you have very significant productivity improvement. And then when it gets mature, we have a stable productivity improvement. But when it gets very, very old, you can have limited productivity improvement. So the 5% I was just referring to is an average for the company. So -- but it's not the same for every technology. Your second question is compare with? Yes. That mid-single digits per year, what has it been in the past? Oh, very similar. We have been doing the mid-single digit. Maybe some year, it's 1% more; some years, it's 1% less. But more or less, it's in the mid-single-digit range. So I guess I'm not really sure why that impacts your CapEx plans then because it's always been like that, right? It does. Because another factor other than the productivity is, we also very carefully plan the peak capacity and watch very carefully for the capacity migration. C.C. was talking about the technology we'll use 90% commonality of tools. If you remember what I said a couple of years ago, the number was at 70%, 80%. So by doing that, it actually enhance the productivity improvement, especially for the leading-edge technology. That's one contribution to that. The second question is on cryptocurrency. This is pretty new to many of us, and I feel like TSMC has been pretty conservative in terms of looking at it in the short term that's the right thing to do. But if you look at it for the next couple of years, 2019, 2020 as you think about your capacity planning, as you think about what customers to support, this is a market that is changing so fast. How do you think about it strategically? Okay. We don't look at the cryptocurrency's market price. It can drop from USD 20,000 to -- down to right now USD 8,000. But it increased from $1,000 to $20,000. This kind of uncertainty that -- is what we are talking about. In terms of capacity support, unless it is sustainable demand, we will not increase the capacity because of this kind of uncertainty demand coming up, unless it's sustainable, in which I know that our customer is developing a lot of things on production, technology, AI. They are doing very well. And we expect that those cryptocurrency's minings, those same one slowly move to AI area. So do you have an estimate for -- if you look at the crypto plus blockchain, how fast is that you may going to grow next several years? First, I always say uncertainty of cryptocurrency mining, so how can I put them together to give you a very good forecast? No, we don't. Let me add. We increase our capacity in lieu of the invested capital ROIC, return in capitals. So if a demand is a spike demand, they will be very careful. But we support -- we try to support the -- our customer in every way. What cryptocurrency developing is that because of price sliding, their demand of high-end technologies increases. So the trail-end becoming not that productive for them. So this is the changing. And in one way, we try to support them with the more advanced technology as we -- quickly at time goes. And secondly, we support them on our available capacity. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So I actually want to follow up Bill's question on your productivity and CapEx. So first of all, can you comment on recent change about the EUV throughput issue? And is that related to your more volatile CapEx range? This is my first question. I think Charlie is asking whether or not we can give additional color about the rumored EUV throughput problems and if that's the problem that causes our CapEx to be more volatile. The EUV progress. As we said, we move smoothly and we've got encouraging result. So that's why I say we are confident that will support the N7+ volume production and the N5 volume production in 2020. Now you're asking about why we increased the CapEx? Because we want to buy a very advanced EUV, too, I call high-end [ A ] tools. And that require that we put some deposit to book the machine slot. That's why we did it. And we are happy that the high-end [ A ] machine will be ready for us to use in the future that will further improve the efficiency and hopefully that increase the productivity, lower down the cost. [Thanks for the clarification.] Just make sure these are highly America aperture in EUV. It's not that same EUV we're doing that. It is a next-generation EUV tools. We work with ASML to book the tool early. And those tool currently is targeting at technology beyond 3-nanometer. Okay. Yes. Thanks for the clarification because investors in general are a little bit nervous about this EUV progress because it's associated to so-called more slow progress, right? So that rumor is that the daily throughput is now around 1,000 wafers per day, right? So it's not that economical. And my worry is that whether they can affect your 7-nanometer-plus cost structure because you still need to use EUV, but the layer of the EUV usage could be fewer than your previous extensions. So anyway, that -- the least -- what market is cheering about. And my second part of the question is about the end markets. Okay. So it's a very difficult market to predict. We understand. But can you clarify the -- your comment on the weak smartphone demand. Because I think now China's smartphone, at least, you see some seasonality, right? So why that is not referred to your revenue guidance upside? And according to our analysis, we think some of your customer think that die size significantly this year. Is that affect the wafer demand for you at a 16-nanometer? This is my second question. The question is quite long, but let me give you some explanation. Yes. We do see China as a market start to pick up in the smartphone. But in TSMC, we -- in our smartphone market segment, there is some very high end, the smartphone is a little bit soft. So that's why we projected that is going to be continuous softness. Okay. It's not because of the China market that's -- that start to pick up slowly. Now we will like to go to the lines for questions. Operator, could you please get to the first caller on the line? Thank you. Our first question today comes from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I just had a follow-up question on crypto. For C.C. Wei, you mentioned it was a strong crypto, a strong Q1. Can you confirm if this is double-digit percent of sales or not? And then, just looking at your revised outlook for 2018, can you help us how we should think about crypto in second half? Do you expect crypto to be flat or up or down versus the first half in your revised outlook? All right. Brett, let me just repeat your question again. You were asking about the cryptocurrency and where C.C. said that demand was growing in the first quarter. So you are asking if first quarter demand accounted for 10% of the total first quarter revenue. And then second half cryptocurrency demand, will that be larger or smaller than the first half cryptocurrency demand. That's your question, right? Yes. All right. Okay. Let me answer the question carefully because I already said the uncertainty of cryptocurrency's mining as we forecast in the future. But so far, we still think that cryptocurrency in the second half still have a higher demand than the first half. And they are using more advanced technologies. They're even moving to the 7-nanometer. That, I can share with you. And can you confirm whether it was double digit or 10% of sales or north in Q1 for crypto? I won't give a specific number of how much or what percentage we are in terms of the revenue. But I'll say it's increasing. Okay. Okay. And just a follow-up on 22-nanometer ULP and 12-nanometer ULP. Can you give us an update on timing and whether there has been any change in how you're thinking about the ramp of 22 and 12-nanometer ULP? Dr. Sun, will you repeat the question? Well, Brett want us to give him an update on the development of 22-nanometer ULP and 12-nanometer ULP and asked if we have any changes in the plan, such as timing, schedule, market. No. We don't change the plan. It continues to be a very important technology to TSMC. And we can guarantee, we speed up the progress. That's what we are doing. And because of where our customer is moving from 28 to 22 and from 16 to 12, so we had to speed it up of all the progress. Our next question today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. One is a follow-up clarification and one question. Just going back to your comment regarding days of inventory that we are not due in Q1. And I think Lora mentioned that they had to do with the 10-nanometer products, especially with the smartphone. Just want to make sure the weakness that you see from the smartphone market especially the premium products in the second quarter, that has to do with inventory digestion and perhaps as the new products ramp in the second half with the premium smartphone show a rebound in the second half. So in other words, is Q2 kind of a digestion, inventory digestion period? And I have a follow- up. All right. Mehdi, let me try to repeat your question and see if it's correct. You are asking about the increase in our days of inventory and then you're asking if the demand of the premium smartphone picks up in the second half of the year. Does that mean that we will begin to digest inventory in the second quarter? Yes. Thank you. Okay. The days of inventory for TSMC in second quarter was 63%. First quarter, 63 days. I explained that because we are ramping down 10-nanometer capacity, and we will massively ramp up 7-nanometer capacity. So we are in a migration period. So we, on purposely, view more inventory on 10-nanometer so we can move the equipment to 7-nanometer, so we can save the CapEx. That's the thing. You're asking whether our days of inventory will go down? Not necessarily because we are ramping our 7-nanometer, which has a much longer cycle time. So I do not expect our days of inventory will go down or will change much in second half of the year. Okay. Very clear. And one other question I have regarding EUV and migration. I understand that 7-nanometer and EUV insertion, that won't really have much of a change to the design rule like a place and route, but there would be a material change at 5-nanometer. In that context, when would you be able to provide those design libraries developed for 5 to the design community so that they could better evaluate a custom benefit of EUV at 5? Well, Mehdi, you are asking us if because we are using EUV, there would be some material changes at 7+ nanometer and therefore, do we provide design library or these other design ecosystem support for -- to incorporate those changes? Yes. We did those. Yes. And just to clarify, I think, some of those changes would impact 5-nanometer more so than 7-nanometer plus? [ While using ] 7 to 7+? Please repeat your question again. Sure. Okay. I think as you migrate from 7 to 7+ and with the inclusion of EUV, there may not be much change to design, especially with the back end of the design place and route. But I do expect a material change at 5-nanometer. In that context, I think the design libraries developed for 5 would be very critical. It helps design community to better evaluate costs and benefit. And I want to understand -- I want to hear from management, when would those design libraries be provided so that we could further evaluate demand for 5-nanometer with increased EUV insertion? Is that clear? So it is the design library with respect to N5, 5-nanometer, given 7+ and 7 are pretty much done. Yes. Yes. So N5. Yes. Yes. N5 technology development is well on track. And some of our customers' function block already designing. So we -- let me comment -- let me -- I captured the first question is N7 to N7+. The design porting, we have demonstrated with several customers, showing that the porting is -- the work is relatively easy. The only major difference is if you want to increase the density, you just change the standard cells which have a tighter density. The rest is -- have -- we have a -- hours and porting hours and -- to support our N7 customers. N5 is a new design. So we does provide the design ecosystem stuff from early. And today is -- we're on track. And we do support our customers' N5 design when they're called upon. Yes. Okay. So does that mean that you have already finalized the number of layers that EUV is going to be inserted for? Your question is that -- is EUV insertable on N7? No, no. I'm -- My question is if you already have provided cell libraries, does that imply that you have already finalized the lower count for 5-nanometer that would include EUV? Oh, so you are asking us if we have finalized the number of layers that we will be using EUV at N5? Have we finalized that number? Yes. Yes. It's already finalized. Is that closer to 10? We do not disclose that. Thank you. And we are coming back to the floor. Okay. Thanks, Mehdi. Coming back to the floor, the next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. My first question is to follow on the CapEx rates for this year. Lora already mentioned about the CapEx rates, half of that is driven by the -- what's that called -- by mask making because of the higher demand from customer design activities. So can you elaborate on that? Okay. Actually, we have seen increasingly a lot, big increase in customer tapeout requirement. And we found out that [ ebbing ] capacity is insufficient. And those tapeout in business is very good business for TSMC. So in order to facilitate customer for their product launch, so we need to add [ ebbing ] capacity immediately. So that's the half bidding I was referring to. Sebastian, let me add some color on this. Okay. We do see a -- increased of tapeouts. And we do see the increase a lot from AI, networking areas and some are from the fabless company, but some of -- from the system startups and some from the -- even the cloud service providers. So some -- in this area, the -- in AI area, we think we are casting a bigger net in accommodating more customers today. How would that into -- turn into volume, we yet to be see. But we are very happy to see the increase of tapeout and participation of new product designs in more companies. I see. Just a follow-up on that because last quarter, you offered the expanded 7-nanometer tapeout by the end of this year will be 50. And this quarter, C.C. already mentioned again you were going to be 50. So if we just -- judging from the number, it doesn't increase and -- but now, you are raising the mask making CapEx. So does that mean that -- actually, the actual numbers internally, you look at, is actually increasing, real tapeouts. Yes. Other notes. Okay. Second question is that if I just do some calculation on the guidance revision for this year. Earlier, it was 10% to 15% and now it's about 10%. So that probably -- if we use a midpoint, probably about close to USD 1 billion of revenue decline. And remember, the last quarter, Chairman talked about the first half year-over-year is about slightly above 15%. And now if we bake in the new guidance for second quarter plus the first quarter we already know, is about 12%. So that's about like USD 600 million full in first half. So does that mean -- and I already had mentioned about the smartphone going to be weak, and -- but which means that there were probably another USD 400 million revision -- a downward revision in second half this year. So would that be mainly driven by smartphone again or the other applications? I think I just described it, is a continued weakness of the smartphone demand and the uncertainty in the cryptocurrency's mining, so we adjust EBITDA. So just to follow on the synergy on cryptocurrency mining. So can I assume that -- even though it's hard to predict, but can I assume that you're beginning a more conservative assumption right now for second half compared to... Yes. The next question will be coming from Goldman Sachs' Donald Lu. First question is what is the new guidance now for 7-nanometer and the 10-nanometer as a percent of revenues by Q4 this year? That's my first question. The second question is going back to this more tapeout activities. I think in -- previously, when you move on to a new node, the tapeout activities has been decreasing. I mean, more markets consolidation, et cetera, if I'm correct. But why suddenly, you see there's more activities from different customers? Is there a reason for that? Or is there going to be a new trend for the industry? Donald, your question regarding the revenue contribution from 7 and 10 in the fourth quarter. Is that right? The -- no, Q4 this year. The last... Oh, Q4 this year. Yes. Forecast. Q4 this year. Okay. 7-nanometer. As C.C. mentioned, for the whole year will be about 10%. But since we are ramping heavily is from third quarter through fourth quarter and we expect the 7-nanometer will contribute more than 20% in fourth quarter revenue. Meanwhile, we are ramping down 10-nanometer. 10-nanometer contribution in first quarter was 19%, and we expect that number to be single digit in the first quarter this year. Well, Don, I think it's a new trend. I think we -- earlier, we see the customer consolidating. But now, we see even smaller company doing the design and tapeouts. And that I think -- and particularly in the AI and networking area. So I think the system architecture today is much freer, much more customized for each new application than before. And therefore, the -- each system company even service provider are willing to participate to -- for the silicon design in order to optimize their system performance or service quality. It -- sorry, just to follow up. Is that because the barrier to entry are lower? Or is that those system companies and startups are getting -- have too much money? I think both. That barrier, definitely lower because the -- all the EDA tools. And it's much more matured today. And also, the venture-capital supply of money is definitely a -- in certain segments is increasing. And -- but mostly, I think the system spec to chip specification, that currently is up to the ingenuity of the system designer not just an outer-shelf product -- existing products. All right. Next question will be coming from HSBC's Steven Pelayo. Just a couple of quick ones here. On 28-nanometer softness, you mentioned it was a lot of the crypto guys looking to accelerate to more advanced nodes. I'm curious beyond crypto at 28-nanometer. Is it also broader-based weakness at 28-nanometer beyond crypto? Yes. We still have a -- you are talking about 20-nanometer? 28-nanometer. You mentioned that being relatively softer... Oh, 28. Oh, let me give you some example. Actually, this year, we see the highest tapeout number from 28, and 28 is a history. This year our tapeout is still higher, okay? So that give you some color on -- as I say that some of the product moved to high-volume product. Most of them are mobile. But then all others like they move into this area. So the tapeout number is still as higher as last year. And last year is a highest number. That's a 28. So other than cryptocurrency, there's a lot of thing. We're talking about automotive, IoT and some of the ISP, those kind of thing, moving. Understood. I just want to make sure the breadth was still there. The other question I have is if you could talk a little bit about manufacturing cycle times going from 16 to 12 to 10 to 7. How long is this? When do you need to be starting wafers now? And I especially want you to talk about and relative to -- I know Elizabeth says we shouldn't pay attention to monthly sales, but you just did a 60% month-on-month. And that's unprecedented in my model. So how are we to look at kind of the monthly volatilities as well as the lengthening manufacturing cycle times? We are improving our manufacturing cycle time from node to node. We continue to improve. So -- but yes, more layers in each technology node as they increase dramatically like from 67 to 77 to 80 days. And for the cycle time, we -- all of that improved quite a bit. But I won't give you the actual number. Steven, you're asking the month-to-month revenue? I'm just surprised with the volatility in the March monthly sales. Obviously... Okay. I am like Elizabeth, don't pay too much attention to it. It's -- assume it's based on customer requirement. So there's a seasonality, and it's node-to-node requirement. Different customers may be different. So it's very hard to predict monthly revenue. All right. It's -- sorry, the next question will be coming from Nomura's Aaron Jeng. After the inventories discussions, I got one question which I didn't expect at the beginning of the call. Can I say that the blended ROIC for tapeout of TSMC will be coming down in the future because of the new trends that more deposits from the small ICT size from system companies? But is there -- they might not be able to generate peak revenue per project. So -- but this trend is new from my understanding. It seems to be kind of a down trend versus what TSMC was seeing in the past cycle. But don't get me wrong, TSMC is still outstanding. But just compared with the volumes sold in the past, the new trends seem to be unfavorable to probably anyone in the market... Well, if you look at our EUVs and margin and that's the -- we welcome more tapeouts just over the mask making. But of course, I think the trend we see it as more designer getting to the new product designs. Okay. They are early entrepreneurs. That's where -- how we grow our customer base back beginning. If you look at the cryptocurrency designer, they are very smart people. And this -- the mining machine, they have a very intricated system designs. They are break all the barriers, pushing to the -- pushing the envelopes. And those designers will come into later on in -- today on cryptocurrency, later on in the AI or blockchain and so forth. That is our ecosystem, part of our ecosystem. And we have here -- are happier to see our ecosystem growth to pave way the future product innovation. Well understood. One follow-up. Another inquiry to support my judgments that you're not increasing the high end of your CapEx per year to $12 billion versus in the past, you were -- which was USD 11 billion. But your revenue target is going to grow up by 5% to 10%, which means that you are spending more for the spend target. So that's also another angle to support my judgment from the call, so that's why I've got this thought. The investment is for the -- yes. We -- the investment -- the EUV investment is for the future, next technology beyond 3-nanometer. And mask making is for the purpose of what I said, is possible that the -- we don't see immediate return, but that is our long-term investment target purposes. Next question will be coming from JPMorgan's Gokul. I had one question on AI, HPC, et cetera and the growth going forward. I think C.C. mentioned that you were expecting 50% of that rate for accelerators in data centers going forward. That's a pretty high number compared to probably single digit today or probably lower double digit. So a couple of years back, you had given a guidance of 5% to 10% with half of the growth coming from mobile and half of the growth coming from HPC and other areas. Could you update the component of that guidance? Does it mean that now smartphone is probably not going to grow from here? Is that how you think about it? And almost all of the growth comes from new areas like HPC, IoT, automotive? And given the very aggressive numbers that you have put out, some of your customers like in media have put out as well a couple of weeks back, what is the tipping point that you need to see to be more confident on areas like HPC? Okay. Mobile security is mostly important segment that we are in. However, as I had mentioned, the AI and 5G Communications that in future that's a -- this mega trend that makes the HPC is a very, very important. And so we see a stronger demand that will contribute to TSMC's revenue. Exactly, what we can expect that in the future, I would say that they are getting more and more important and that higher than we thought last year, actually. You want to add something? Yes. The -- you questioned -- yes. We -- earlier -- the crystal ball we saw before, the smartphone going to give us, in 5 years, going to give us 50% growth dollar. Now it looks smaller like 40%, a little bit more than 40%. But HPC used to be 25%. But it looks like it going to be close to 40%. So HPC as we look at for -- it seems stronger than we saw before and smartphone a little bit weaker than way before. In IoT and automotive, it's about the same. But to be honest, this goal has a time and even in smartphone, we look at 5G transition, that will be another industry transition. If you look at the 4G transition, it's -- the demand has changed the whole landscape. So -- but that's what we look at today. And we'll go along the -- along with this industry during the migration and update for you. Yes. If I could just add -- as -- put some more perspective on this. A lot of new tapeouts increasing mask capacity feels like the beginning of another new product cycle, typically, I think. Could you compare how this looks like compared to, say, 10 years back at the beginning of your smartphone product cycle? Probably, a lot of your current big customers are very much smaller at that point in time asking for more tapeouts as well and mask capacity. Could you compare how it feels like today versus 10 years back in the beginning of the smartphone cycle? We don't know. We don't know. It's a -- just like smartphone, when the first smartphone came, we did not know. So it really depend on the usage model and application on those products. But we just cast a wide net and make sure we support all the innovators. All right. Questions would be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. One follow-up question on the gross margin. With the midpoint at 48% in second quarter, how should we think about second half where you normally have the peak season, you're also implying at least half-on-half growth. Is it still the target? I think in the past, you've said close to 50%. Is that still kind of the range we'd get some leverage first half to second half? I think the foreign exchange rate if you compare with last year, it will be a hit for the whole year. That's number one. And the second half, we are expecting more 7-nanometer coming on the line, which will have 2 to 3 percentage point dilution to corporate margin. So these 2 factor are negative. So I think we -- you should not assume anything will be the same as 2017. Okay. And then one question on the tool reuse. 7+ has a lot of reuse. For 5-nanometer where it's a bigger change with EUV. Does that change the equation, that it's a different? Or do you think you can keep that same conversion down to 5? We're not seeing the -- every generation, new migration will be utilized more than 90% of the previous generation tool, so the convertibility is pretty high even for 5-nanometer. CL Securities' Sebastian has a follow-up. Just one. On the inventory, turnover days increased if you compare it on the well-why perspective, increased almost 20 days. Lora already mentioned about this the -- some raw wafer inventory pre-bill for a 7-nanometer. So I wondered how much of it is just pre-bill for the 7-nanometer ramp? Or how much of it is because the raw wafer is more expensive today so we want to buy more now? Preview has higher waiting than the raw wafer. Raw wafer will be a few days. The remaining are the preview and the complexity in technologies. You're comparing to a long time ago, right? You see 20 days difference there. So does that mean that you don't need to buy then as many wafers in the following quarters? I don't quite get your questions. Because you already prepared some of the raw wafer right now for second half ramp. And does that mean that you don't need to buy as many as raw wafers in second half this year compared to first quarter. That's right. Yes. A follow-up question from [ Sino Link's ] Andrew. My follow-up question. First one is regarding CapEx to sales ratio. I remember last time, Dr. Chang mentioned the long-term will stay as 20% to 30%. But for this year, we raised another -- so it's about 30% to 33%. And are we still staying this assumption for the next few years, 20% to 30% CapEx to sales ratio? Yes. That's due to -- at 30% level, around 30%. So we changed from 20%, 30% to 30% level? First, within 25% to 30% anyway, okay? This year, it will be higher, yes, for the reason I was just mentioning, slightly above 30%. And if you look at the couple in the years down the road will be around 30%. Some year may be lower, slightly lower than 30%, some year at 30%. So more like a 25% to 30% range. Yes. That's still true. All right. You have another question? My last question is, are we really gaining back the customer we are losing on 14-nanometer and 10-nanometer for 7? I did not mention any customer name. We are the only 7-nanometer provider. So you can imagine that -- the answer over your questions. Well, I am just going to -- for the interest of time, only going to limit two questions. So one person each, okay? Citi's Roland first and then Deutsche Bank's Michael. One question each. For C.C., now you are ramping up 16-nanometer production in China. So what are you going to do if customer need to do the InFO or CoWoS packaging there? Are you going to build the InFO or CoWoS capacity there? Or are you going to logistically -- to ship back from Taiwan? So this is about InFO and the CoWoS? Well, that will depend on customers' demand and customers' need. We always support them as much as possible if we can support locally, we'll do it. But today... But not today. Yes. Today is not in open yet. Okay. So when? When are you going to build a CoWoS or InFO? Depend on customers' demand. Michael? [ Major ] mentioned the 7-nanometer will be very massive. But will -- most of customers shift to Finometer -- or they will skip Finometer and shift to 3 nanometer directly? Your question is are those 7-nanometer... Customer. Will shift to Finometer or they will -- some customer will skip Finometer. We've developed that technology, working with the customer to meet their product design. They are products bag and we are products performance. So clearly, they moved to 5 or now they depend on their products nature. And so some of them, they definitely will move. Some of them probably will stay in 7, 7+. So in the past year, 2010, seems to be a -- show no, right? So that will be -- we see the Finometer as a show no or... No. 5-nanometer will be a very long node and useful and very cost effective. And will start in 2020.
Okay. With that, we will conclude our today's conference. Please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 3 hours from now. Transcript will become available 24 hours from now. Both of which will be available through our website at www.tsmc.com.

Today's event is webcast live through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. [Operator Instructions] As this conference is viewed by investors around the world, we will conduct this event in English only.
The format for today's event will be as follows:  First, TSMC's Senior Vice President and CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2018, followed by our guidance for the third quarter. Afterward, Ms. Ho and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then, TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu will host the Q&A session, where all 3 executives will entertain your questions.
For those participants on the call, if you do not yet have a copy of today's press release, you may download it from TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. Please also download the summary slides in relation to today's earnings conference presentation.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statement that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now, I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC's CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I will first summarize our second quarter financial results and then provide the guidance for the third quarter.
Our second quarter revenue in USD 7.85 billion, a decrease of 7.2% sequentially, but an increase of 11.2% year-over-year. In NT dollars, revenue declined 6% sequentially mainly due to the impact from mobile product seasonality.
Gross margin was 47.8% in the second quarter, a decrease of 2.5 percentage point versus first quarter. About 2 percentage point of the decrease was attributable to the absence of the favorable inventory valuation that I had mentioned in April, while the remainder was attributable to a lower level of capacity utilization, partially offset by cost improvements and slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate.
Operating expenses ratio was 11.3% as our revenue decreased more than our expense decreased. Operating margin decreased 2.8 percentage points Q-over-Q to reach 36.2% in the second quarter.
As I said during the last quarterly conference, the corporate tax rate was increased to 17.5% in the second quarter as we accrued the 10% tax on undistributed retained earnings, the tax rate will fall back to 10% to 11% level in the second half, and the full year tax rate will be above 12%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was $2.79 and ROE was 18.7%.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the second quarter, Communication and Industrial standard decreased 14% and 1%, respectively, while Computer and Consumer increased by 34% and 23%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. We begin while in production of 7-nanometer process technology in the second quarter. The revenue contribution was less than 1% in second quarter, and it will ramp to above 10% in the third quarter. 10-nanometer contributed 13% of total wafer revenue during the second quarter, while the combined revenue from 16- and 20-nanometer accounted for 25%, and 28-nanometer was 23%. Advanced technologies defined as 28-nanometer and more accounted for 61% of total wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 749 billion, an increase of TWD 65 billion from the first quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 121 billion as we accrued about TWD 208 billion for cash dividends, which will be paid out today.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 4 days to 38 days. Days of inventory increased 11 days to 74 days primarily due to the ramp-up of 7-nanometer, which has a longer cycle time and a slight increase in low wafers.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 130 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 60 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 70 billion. Overall, cash balance increased by TWD 54 billion to TWD 632 billion at the end of the second quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditures spent in the first half of 2018 totaled USD 4.5 billion.
Now I have finished my financial summary of the second quarter. Now let me provide you the third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect third quarter revenue to be between USD 8.45 billion and USD 8.55 billion, which is an 8.2% sequential increase at the midpoint.
Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.50, our third quarter gross margin is expected to be between 48% and 50%. And our third quarter operating margin is expected to be between 36.5% and 38.5%. This conclude my financial summary.
Now let me make remarks on capital expenditure and profitability. I'll first talk about the capital expenditure. In our last Investor Conference in April, we stated our 2018 CapEx budget to be between USD 11.5 billion to USD 12 billion. However, we now plan to trim our CapEx budget by about USD 1.5 billion and expect our 2018 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion and USD 10.5 billion.
The reduction of 2018 CapEx come from the following 3 factors. The first one, about USD 700 million came from delay of payment to 2019 due to leading edge towards relocation schedule adjustment. However, the planned capacity remains unchanged.
Second, about USD 600 million comes from efficiency gains that allow us to spend less on tools. Third, about USD 200 million comes from the U.S. dollar appreciation against euro and Japanese yen.
My second remark is regarding profitability. Now I will talk about third quarter '18 gross margin and the overall outlook of our profitability. Our third quarter gross margin is expected to improve from second quarter by more than 1 percentage point. The increase mainly comes from better utilization rate, more favorable foreign exchange rate and improved profitability of our back-end business, offset, however, by the offerable technology mix, which include the ramp of 7-nanometer that is expected to dilute our gross margin by more than 1 percentage point in the third quarter and the lower contribution from 28-nanometer. The net gain in gross margin, therefore, is expected to be slightly more than 1 percentage point.
That said, TSMC's financial objective remain unchanged. Our goal is to achieve revenue and net income compound annual growth rate in the next few years to be between 5% and 10% in U.S. dollars, gross margin to be about 50%, operating margin to be about 39% and ROE to be above 20%.
This ends my remark. Now let me turn the microphone to C.C. for his comment. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We conclude our second quarter with revenue of TWD 233.3 billion or USD 7.5 -- USD 7.85 billion, in line with our guidance given 3 months ago. This result reflected mainly a stronger demand from high-performance computing, including cryptocurrency mining, but it was offset by seasonal decline in high-end smartphones.
Moving into third quarter 2018. Our business is expected to benefit from new product launches using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology, while cryptocurrency mining demand was declining due to weakening cryptocurrency prices. That being said, we do see slight improvement in smartphone demand in second half of this year as compared to our forecast 3 months ago. CPU demand for AI in the gaming continues to increase.
For the full year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow by 5% while foundry is expected to grow by about 7%. We forecast TSMC's 2018 revenue in U.S. dollar will grow by a high single-digit rate rather than the previously stated about 10% due to general weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand.
Now let me move to long-term business growth driver. As we stated 3 months ago that we are optimistic about the development of the industry's megatrend, particularly AI and 5G communication. Recently, we have observed more promising development. For example, we see AI continues to faster proliferate from data center to edge server and to end client devices. As for 5G, major operator in several countries has rolled out the development schedule, while multiple ODMs and IC vendors have planned their 5G products, which are set to ramp in the coming 2 years. Despite the slow unit growth in smartphones in the near term, we expect the development of 5G will fuel the next wave of smartphone growth both in units and in silicon content.
In HPC, we expect the increasing workload in data center and complexity of AI will boost the demand for AI accelerator, GPU and CPU in several. We also expect the introduction of next-generation video gaming will add growth of HPC. We believe all our 4 core platforms, smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive, are well positioned to benefit from the longer-term megatrend of AI and 5G. We saw a leading and comprehensive technology offering our vast capacity and our policy of not competing with customers. We will be able to support our customers to expand their markets and, therefore, fuel our future growth.
Let me talk about N7 ramp-up stages. TSMC's 7-nanometer technology is leading in the industry. It has the best performers, power and area density, and its schedule is ahead of competition. For the tape-outs that we have completed for customers, all have very good yield and performers. We forecast a total of more than 50 customer product tape-outs by end of this year from a wide range of applications covering mobile, server CPU, network processor, gaming, GPU, FPGA, cryptocurrency, automotive and AI. Our 7-nanometer is already in volume production and accounted for less than 1 percentage of our total wafer revenue in second quarter. It's expected to jump more than 10% of our wafer revenue in third quarter and is estimated to contribute more than 20% revenue for us in fourth quarter in this year.
Let me talk about the N7+ and EUV. Our 7-nanometer-plus or N7+ can leverage the success of our N7 and enjoy 15% to 20% better [ day ] density and more than 10% power reduction. We saw few EUV layers replacing certain emerging [indiscernible] where we process, we're able to have few masking layers, shorter cycle time and less process complexity. Therefore, we expect to achieve better yield as compared to our N7.
Furthermore, as we have fine-tuned all the advanced equipment to their optimum condition due to the ramp-up of both our 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies, we believe we can leverage our production lending to 7+ and enjoy the industries of best defect density among our peers' comparable technologies.
The silicon result from our N7+ today are very encouraging. The [ deed ] N7+ product has tape-out early dispense, and we expect to receive a few more tape-outs by end of this year. Volume production will start at Q2 next year. That is Q2 2019, which will be the worst first EUV fund reproduction by that time. We have made ready multiple EUV scanners to support not only the N7+ development but also N5 development. Our silicon data have proved all the benefits we expect to form process simplification with EUV. In addition, we have also started our N3 technology development using EUV.
Now let me talk about the EUV status. Good progress continued to be made in the EUV infrastructure in the last few months. They include photoresist, mask defect and yield petticoat defects in transmission. Beside the silicon development, EUV technology continues to mature toward high-volume production. We have achieved 250 watts source upgrade in April, and the tools are running smoothly with minimum degradation and high level of uptime. In summary, we started EUV development work early, and we have secured the largest number of EUV tools among our peers to be ready for 2019 volume production for N7+ and 2020 volume production for N5.
Let me talk about N5. Our 5-nanometer technology, N5 is progressing well. The 256 megabits as revealed is 1 quarter ahead of schedule, and the device performance is well on track. TSMC's N5 will begin risk production in first half 2019. We believe it will be the most advanced technology in the foundry industry by that time. We are actively engaging with several lead customers, and we are running their test chip now. We expect to receive first customer product tape-out in first half 2019. Volume production is expected to start in first half 2020.
I'm talking about now with our specialty technology. We work closely with our customer to accelerate our specialty technology roadmap. By leveraging our logic capability, we developed specialty technology features, such as MEMS, CMOS image sensor, high-voltage power management IC, emerging and bigger memories and analog to more advanced node, including 55-, 40-nanometer and 28-, 22-nanometer. These efforts bring scaling benefit to our customers.
Our 22ULP process is qualified and on track for risk production in August. That is next month. About 40 customer product tape-outs using our N22 are planned in the next few quarters, covering a broad spectrum of applications from digital EUV, consumer electronics, to IoT and RF connectivity. N22 have 15% performance gain, 25% power reduction, and 5% to 10% die error shrink when compared with N28. With these improvements, we expect our N22 will extend our leadership at 28-nanometer node and enjoy a long and successful economic life.
Since we have already built a broad technology capacity at 12-inch for various specialty technologies, we are migrating some of our customer's product from 8-inch to 12-inch with similar transition, where our customer can enjoy flexible capacity support and further scaling benefit. And that's all. I thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Now, let's begin the Q&A session. First question will be coming from Credit Suisse, Randy Abrams. The first question I had on the 28-nanometer. You talked last quarter about it being a bit underutilized. Could you talk about now your confidence to backfill that node? And last quarter, you mentioned a big mask investment. How much of that is tied to some of these backfill activities versus the mask writer investment for some of the advanced applications? So you have 2 questions. The first one is 28 nanometers loading and... Yes.  I think 28 loading -- your confidence to get that loaded, the type of applications. The second part of that is the mask investment. How much of that is tied to these backfill applications versus advanced capacity? All right. In my statement, I say that we improved 28-nanometer to 22. And now, a lot of 28-nanometers tape-out has been changed to 22-nanometer. And we start to ramping up 22-nanometer next month. It will take probably a few quarters so that 22-nanometer volume will be high. So I expect that after a few quarters, the 28-nanometer node, the confidence to fully utilize high -- is high. Now you're talking about... Can I add to this one? Yes. Regarding your question, by the way, thank you, and good afternoon everyone that joined this conference and also the online participants, particularly on this hot summer afternoon. On 28-nanometer, this is the eighth year of our 28 production, and inevitably the competition is coming gradually. And with some expectation, they build capacities. But the 28-nanometer has a lot of nuance in it. You have high performance. They're a different grade of speed. Now SEC is talking about additional subnode 22-nanometer. I think the underloading will be a -- temporary, and we intend to backfill this capacity based on our technology differentiation. So Randy, your second question is in waste and mask as a capacity. Very high CapEx last quarter for mask. Just what was the purpose or what applications were tied to this high capacity relative to history that you've called out the mask CapEx? Still -- actually, we invest our mask capacity because of a leading-edge node. Most of it is because of leading-edge node because it's very complicated. You make it a mask and many layers. For -- related to 28 is part of it because we still have a very high activity in 28-nanometer node. Actually, still that's a #1, #2 tape-outs come for TSMCs total tape-outs. Okay. So it sounds like it's both 28-plus for the 7-nanometer for the mask? N16. The second question I have on cryptocurrency. In the past, it was on a lagging node like 28 and 16, where it was filling capacity as a second-wave application. How do you view crypto? It's slowing in the second half? But how do you view devoting new capacity as crypto to get the best performance and power want to move to 7. So how do you see that market and also devoting capacity if it becomes more of a first-wave application? Well, cryptocurrency all related it to the house rate. So naturally, they were moved to very high-end leading-edge technologies to improve the performance and lower down the power consumption. Whether that -- it will be at the same time as a high [indiscernible] when we move into the leading edge that I -- probably, we cannot say that. It's volatile in the business. You knew it, and its continued to depend on the cryptocurrency's pricing, so we don't plan our capacity because of that. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. Lora talked about a slightly lower CapEx, and $600 million of that is from the efficiency gains. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Is that mostly from 7-nanometers? Or where is the gains coming from? Okay. The $600 million efficiency gains actually covers various areas. Number one is process simplifications. If you have a simpler process, you don't need to buy that much tools, #1. And we also share tools between R&D and operations. If we can find more opportunity to share, we don't have to buy that much tool, okay. The third one is relating to the big end equipments. We do see with effort from TSMC and customer jointly do see a test in reductions. So those are the few areas that we classify as efficiency gain. Of course, you know we are always doing that, and we just have results coming right now. Lora, I can add more color to that. What we call efficiency is that. Let me tell you, we plan customers' product out. So you need some kind of  a processing cycle time. You need to buy the tool. Tool has a leading time. So now we improve our process cycle time quite a lot. So now you don't have to buy the tools so early. Why? The tool is -- the equipment vendor work with us, so they also shorten their leading time. So we don't need to buy so early, and that's what we call part of the reason of that core efficiency improvement. And it has continued to improve. That's progressing every day, every month. I guess, I'm just wondering how much of it is onetime. And how much of it can I translate into lower CapEx going forward? It will be a continuous effort because it's our job to shorten the cycle time. Usually, if we ramp up a new technology, the cycle times will be longer. Now we are getting better. We're getting very aggressive and very competitive cycle time, and so that's why we can cut it. Sorry, one last follow-up on that. So I don't know what the exact number is, but I think the company has said CapEx the next several years, if I'm not mistaken, $10 billion to $11 billion. So do you want to comment on that whether there's any new thinking or changes? Of course, number is -- it's a kind of rolling forecast. As far as we can see, it's still within that range, and the CapEx intensity, as I said earlier, is somehow between 25% to 30%. We're still with that view. My second question is on 7-nanometers. It sounds like it's progressing quite well and maybe slightly ahead of plan in terms of your improvement and such. Can you just talk about the yield and the improvements that you're making there versus the previous couple of nodes, maybe 10 and 16? The yield progressing very well. Performance is good. As compared with previous node, it's comparable probably a little bit better. But I cannot give you exact number. Basically, 7-nanometer we just have a better architecture and make the yield improvement easier. Would that imply that you get to corporate average for as much and a little bit earlier as well? I think the rule of thumb, I said, about 8 quarter from mass production into quarterly average is about the same. We have seen that for -- every node have that kind of pattern. There's no exception this time. Next question will be coming from Deutsche Bank, Michael Chou. The first question is actually for 28 follow-up. You mentioned after a few quarters, your UTR for 28 overall should improve. So is that under the assumption of the same capacity this year? And do you think the next year total 28-, 22-nanometer sales will be up year-over-year? That's my first question. Michael, let me tell you that TSMC continued to improve the productivity. So actually even if we don't spend the CapEx, the capacity continued to increase. So that every year, when we're talking about our business versus the utilization, actually, the capacity continued to increase. And your question is the revenue? .
Yes. Would 28, 22 now meet together be up year-on-year in 2019 and do maintenance and -- I shouldn't say maintenance.  Given the underutilized 28-nanometer, would you consider conversion of 28 node capacity to advanced node going forward?  Or you will just maintain the same capacity? Converting the capacity is last resort, okay. We want to fill the capacity based on technology. This is a constant effort. And 22-nanometer is one example. There are other specialty technologies on the pipeline to offer, and that is our first result, hopefully, to get to fill it up as much as we can. If by then, then we will have other capacity adjustment options. But at this time, it's not on our plan. So do you expect revenue? I would expect in 2019 probably drop a little bit because we are ramping up. And after that, we'll start to increase. You mean, 2020? Yes. Second question regarding your 7-nanometer progress. You mentioned you will do several CPU if I heard you right. So would that be on base of x86 or you not give color for that? It's too specific. So it's a CPU. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. You talked about 7-nanometer will be more than 10% of the total revenue in 3Q versus less than 1% in second quarter. So the increase for the 7-nanometer is more like 10%, but the 3Q overall revenue guidance gross is less than 10%. It means the other revenue from 10-nanometer and above are declining. So can you give us more color for this technology node, which node is strong, which node is weak in 3Q? Which node is strong? Which node is weak? Yes. Because the overall 10-nanometer, 16, 20, 28 and above, the overall revenue in 3Q will be declining sequentially. So I would like to know for -- which node specifically is strong and which node is weak in 3Q? I cannot comment on that, right. But we know 28-nanometer actually will still declining. Is that right? Right. So it means 16 would be still... You want to ask one by one, huh? Starting from 1.5-micron or something like that. That's good enough. Actually, you know that our 7-nanometer is very strong. 7 and 10 very strong. 16-nanometer is fully loaded. So that's good enough information for you to estimate. Okay. And follow-up question for this 7-nanometer ramp-up because now we think 7-nanometer will be a major node like 16- and the 28-nanometer. So the question is for next year, for 7-nanometer revenue ramp-up, will it be similar as 16-nanometer in 2016 or 28-nanometer in 2013, which is the second year for -- you ramp up this... Stronger than any node we have in history. Okay, so that means for next year for maybe on a single quarter it that your -- for 7-nanometer reach -- 30% of the total revenue will be a reachable target? I don't want to go through quarter, okay, Roland. I would say -- we just said, 7-nanometer will account for 10% third quarter, more than 20% in fourth quarter. For next year, 7-nanometer will account for more than 20% for the whole year. That's all I can say. Okay. Second question is for June monthly sales, unusually declined by double-digit percentage point year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Was that because a customer did not take the waver shipment in their quarter-end? Or was that purely because of the demand weakness? Don't look at the monthly revenue, because -- look at the quarterly revenue, which we have just provided guidance. Okay. But I still have to ask, how about the 3Q monthly sales linearity in 3Q? The monthly linearity is not really in our control. The customer is shipping ahead of their schedules, sometimes within a couple days range they want to adjust their inventory, and there are many factors. So it's not to our target to -- we target each month to have a financial goal, rather it would be a quarterly goal. Next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. My first question is on N5. Regarding the tape-out, already mentioned that you expect to receive the first tape-out in first quarter or early next year. So how much -- how many tape-outs do you expect to receive by the end of next year before the mass production beginning first half 2020? Actually, we don't know at this time. 5-nanometer as a node, of course, is in the development. Right now we know that we have customer test chips put it in our test vehicles, several of them. And those are the functional block of their products. So at this time, most of them haven't committed a tape-out date. So we really cannot summarize the number particular time, but the engagement activity is very active. So how do you compare the engagement activity or customer interest to N7 at the same stage? At this time, probably less than N7 at the beginning because this is a big investment for our customers. And they would -- I think they are planning a later time when N7 gets to ramp up in [ full '18 ]. Then how do you see the ROI on N5 versus N7? If less interest right now, and how do you -- and the investment is probably larger for you and how the interest or the payback ROI, how do you compare N5 and N7 at this moment? It will be very similar. Okay. My second question is on the advanced packaging that noticed -- I think TSMC has continued to roll out new or launch new packaging offerings almost every year. So can you give us more -- some update on that? And what kind of -- how many product offering you have on this? And do you see this becoming -- TSMC become even more serious in packaging rather than just in the past to facilitate the big customers? We have been very serious all the time. And in fact, to add some color to it, in the future, we see the high-performance computing is very important. And TSMC's advanced packaging help the customer to improve the system performance and so there are more and more activities to engage with the customer for their high-end computing devices. Okay. So can we assume that a big portion of the new tape-out you are receiving on 16-, 12-, 7- and potentially 5-nanometers will adopt your packaging solution whatever is info is variance or a co-loss? Sebastian, the advanced packaging is a major thrust of our technology development. The reason is the Moore's law over the years is indeed slowing down. That means that we have to create more value to our customer on their product to allow the technology migration to continue. And advanced packaging is -- you can almost say it's a parallel thrust together with Moore's law to develop our customers' products. And advanced packaging development encompass the -- our customer's architecture development and algorithm development. In that, I'm talking about we're going to the 3D-IC and that is the purpose to add to this -- to Moore's law development to maximize our customer's product. Okay, so this is not a typical packaging business. It is a major technology development for TSMC. Although today it is indeed more expensive, some of the market sector cannot afford it. So today we see the affordable segment will be the high-performance computing, particularly the server and also the high-speed networking area. Of course, the current biggest customer is in the mobile and I believe the mobile sector will gradually come in when they see the value. So it is not a typical Moore's law 10 pace, rather it is an additional development effort to augment it to the Moore's law. That is my response in the total picture. So this part of things are now -- before the info launch and now you have more offerings, so presumably, you can generate more packaging revenue going forward and that is incremental compared to the past. So can we assume that your packaging revenue -- or I know you report a nonwafer revenue part of business in [indiscernible] and that is about -- over 10% last year. And can we assume that those part of the business can reach -- grow faster than your wafer revenue going forward? Of course. Of course, we want to -- we expect that. Again, it is -- in this semiconductor, packaging in the past hasn't been playing the role of increased system performance. And this is new and we indeed first see in our biggest customers' verification products. But there are new customers who are interested in that, including some of them are mobile, some of them are high-performance computing, but cost is always a factor in determining when do they move into this technology. Then that varies segment by segment. Next question will be coming from JPMorgan's Gokul. My first question is on N7+ and N5. So given N5 is a pretty high layer count for EUV. In your early engagement with customers, are you seeing customers trialing N7+ at least for some small-volume products and then going to N5? Or are you seeing more customers directly going to N5? And could also give a view on how big N7+ is likely to be? Is it going to be a small volume node but N7+ is still going to be majority of the 7-nanometer family? That's my first question. Gokul, yes, and no correlation that when the customer need to go to N7+ and then go to N5. Customer choose working with TSMC for their product development. So they choose the best technology, but at the time that fits their product well. So no correlation. But you are talking about whether they need to go through this, no. So you feel like that customers are already comfortable with the EUV throughput at that level of layer count to directly correlate? Yes, because we communicate with them our progress and our status. And actually today we have a very good progress and still feel comfortable with. Okay. Just one clarification on the smartphone commentary in terms of slightly better demand that you're seeing in smartphones compared to the last 3 months. Could you classify it? Is it more coming in the mid- to low end? Or is it really at the high end? And second question is, is it because TSMC is gaining more share compared to what you expected to -- or your gains are coming faster? Or is it a view on the overall smartphone market itself? Most of these are high-end smartphones, all right. And mid-, low end, industry-wide is weak, although it's gradually coming back, but its pace of coming back is slower than expected. Next question will be coming from Goldman Sachs, Donald Lu. I have 2 questions. First question is about China, here I have 2 specific questions. One is that earlier this year when the ZTE saga starts to play out, MediaTek initially said it cannot ship to ZTE, but my understanding is TSMC has never turned down ZTE's wafer order. So I'm wondering what's going on here? Is there a law or rule or something going forward going to dictate how you can serve Chinese customer because Chinese customer now account almost 1/4 of your revenues? Second on China is UMC is going to list its China -- entity in China and arguably can get a lot of capital for R&D and the growth. Will TSMC one day consider that and I'm sure it will be very well welcomed? Yes, I have another question, but I will wait. First, on ZTE. Yes, when the U.S. government put a ban on the shipment to ZTE, indeed most company, ZTE's supplier, start the shipment. However, TSMC is not a direct supplier to ZTE. It's not a direct supplier to ZTE. So indeed, some of the -- they do have a subsidiary of ZTE and -- but according to the rule you need to have a certain percentage of value-added from the U.S. And so -- but that particular subsidiary, the value-added is mostly from China and from TSMC. So that also is beyond the restriction scope. Sorry, can you explain a little more here? I understand ZTE also makes chips and that's manufactured at the TSMC, so that's not correct? No, no. ZTE do not make chips and send order to TSMC. They do have a subsidiary and a small in-house and very small volume have some business with us. However, we talked to Taiwan government and outside counsel, the value-added doesn't occur at U.S. So it was not in the restriction scope. And hypothetically, if HiSilicon have a problem similar to ZTE, would that be a... I don't want to answer the hypothetical question, okay. Thank you. You have another question? Yes. It's on the potential Asia listing of your great fab... Okay, this goes to Lora. Lora, tell me we are not short of capital, okay. When a company go for IPO, main purpose to source the funding and we have enough funding to support our growth. There is no plan for us to do that, okay. I have -- second question is on 7-nanometer, the first is about China. 7-nanometer, I have a question. What was TSMC's market share at 16-nanometer and at the 7-nanometer foundry market? And also how, compared to TAM, how much is 7-nanometer TAM versus 16-nanometer TAM in terms of market size? Our 7-nanometer market share and 16-FinFET, okay. 16-FinFET market share is pretty high and 7-nanometer is even higher. How much high, 10% more? I cannot be so specific, right. High is high. Is the TAM of 7-nanometer... The TAM of 7-nanometer is bigger. Bigger than 16? Yes. Why is that because historically that seems to be decreasing. Why 7-nanometer? Well, just some reason. We are talking about AI, we are talking about 5G, high-performance computing all add together so... Talk about dollar, dollar of TAM, right? Let's actually go to the line for the first caller on the line. Operator, please. We have a question from  [ HSBC, Steven Pelayo. ] In the fourth quarter conference call, you disclosed last year's 7% of revenues came from back-end services, now you're talking about also improved profitability in that area. Can you help us understand your outlook for total back-end services contribution this year? And how significant the profitability improvement is? Back-end contribution this year and profitability. The back-end contributions to total revenue is increasing. It's slightly higher than last year with the more advanced packaging coming on the line. So I think back-end and [indiscernible] is up, is slightly more than 10% of our revenue versus about 10% last year. Okay. And one more question for you, Lora. I remember last year, you also had 10-nanometer going to greater than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter. This year, you have 7-nanometer going to greater than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter. The guidance that you just gave for the third quarter suggested 100 basis points of headwind from the initial ramp of 7-nanometer. I'm curious as 7-nanometer goes to more than 20% of revenues in the fourth quarter, does the volume start to offset and you won't get as much of a headwind? Or the fact that it's such a large percentage of mix, will 7-nanometer still be a significant headwind to potential margin progression going into the fourth quarter? So Steven's question is, if we ramp 7-nanometer to more than 20% revenue in the fourth quarter, what will be the margin headwind brought by this ramp? In the first year of -- but actually, usually the margin for 7-nanometer is lower than corporate average. So we do see, with the third quarter guidance I just gave you, which include the 10% contribution from 7-nanometer, this is going to dilute corporate margin by 1 percentage point -- slightly more than 1 percentage point. And going forward to the fourth quarter where 7-nanometer will account for more than 20% of total wafer revenue, we expect the dilution will be about 2.5 percentage point to corporate gross margin. Okay, great. And if I could just sneak one last one in. I'm surprised we haven't talked much about feedback from your customers on potential trade war impacts. Does TSMC have a viewpoint? And what are you hearing from your customers on potential impacts for the rest of this year? On the U.S.-China trade tension and the issue, the tariffs on the 3 waves, first wave is on the $34 billion products, second wave on $16 billion and third wave is on the $200 billion, and only the first wave has been executed today. And in that, we see very minimal impact for our business and our customer. Those are the -- mostly, we relate it to the IC -- related to the semiconductor is only discrete devices in the first wave. On the second wave, although it's still in the comment stage, but we do a thorough check on that effects. It does include integrated circuits. However, we look at it and it still have very minimal impact -- effect in our business so far. So even though the SIA in the U.S. is still protesting about including the IC into the second phase, but what I'm talking about -- what I've been talking about even though they put it into effect, it's still a very minimal effect. Next question we'll be coming back to the floor. Sorry, let's come back to the floor first. It will be from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So my question is actually a follow-up to previous questions. First of all, is the smartphone semi better in third quarter? Is that -- do you see a upward revision of smartphone semiconductor over -- you mean is that better than second quarter? Can you comment on that? Of course, it's better than second quarter because 3 months ago, we are a little bit more conservative. But recently, the development in the smartphone units actually recovered. So it's better than what we forecasted 3 months ago, but it's not a big deviation from our forecast at the beginning of this year. Okay. And I guess, another question that if you also care about is your revenue exposure to the crypto semiconductor. So after 2 quarters, what is the exposure in the first half? And what do you think percentage of crypto semi will be in the second half? We already mentioned that because of our cryptocurrency's pricing, so we forecast softer demand from the cryptocurrency mining in the second half. So as part of the ratio between the first half and the second half, I cannot be so specific, but one of the reasons is very uncertain, right. It's volatile, but our own forecast we lowered it down. I think the true picture is we -- currently, we, at our best effort to forecast a weaker cryptocurrency. However, it's largely compensated by the increased strength of the smartphone. So that's why the total number we have forecast is not that different. However, cryptocurrency still have some uncertainty, right, that's why we adjusted the 10% number. But still, we are going to fight for that to reach close to that, yes. Okay. So my next question is regarding your AI semiconductor. It has been a very strongly growing sector over the past 2 years, right, and it's going to be another key growth driver for coming years. So can you give us some numbers? For example, the AI semiconductor contribution this year, last year and the growth rate trajectory in the coming year, especially next year, are you going to see AI semiconductor double? And I want to define this AI semiconductor a little bit. So that should exclude the AI features including the smartphone chipset. I'm referring to those discrete chips mainly is for cloud, AI or the edge AI. Wow, that's a good question, but very hard to answer because most of the AI's functionalities today is embedded into the existing product. For example, you look at the smartphone in these days, the application processor embedded a lot of AI functionality inside. So you can have a lot of new features, right, the face recognition, the voice recognition and then -- et cetera, et cetera. So if you want to specifically identify what is increased over last year, what is increased over this year is pretty hard for us to do. But we can see the activity going up because if you look at networking processor keep coming, application processor for the older smartphone keep increasing functionality so you can estimate what kind of die size they increase, so the silicon content. By doing that, you probably can figure out what is that contribution and why TSMC making it so big deal because we saw the trend from AI and 5G all combined together, that would be a megatrend. Let me add some further future communication purposes. AI is in every growth segment we have, okay. In the smartphone, in the automotive, in IoT, AI increased the silicon content. For the high-performance computing, indeed there are a lot of discrete AI chips. So if we -- those discrete AI chips that include xPU, accelerator GPUs and network processors and some of them even games is in that -- those are discrete CPU. So as we speak today, indeed high-performance computing growth is pretty fast. Last year it was 40%, this year is 25%, around that, because the reason it's slowing down because cryptocurrency is included in the high-performance computing. So [indiscernible] up is still the highest growth sectors today we have, yes, but the future is very difficult to predict. Like this year, we're just trying to help our customer to expand their market as quickly as possible. I think we still need to go back to the line for the next caller. Operator, please. Next question is from Agency Partners, Douglas Smith. A couple of quarters ago, Morris Chang said that there were no plans to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. because of current events. Has that been resolved? And the second question is what steps is TSMC taking to protect its intellectual property given there have been a lot of allegations of IP theft recently. First question is to -- we have mentioned that we have no plan to expand manufacturing capacity in The United States. Have we changed our mind? No, we did not. It's working. No, we did not change our plan. Only when it's necessary we will do it.  So far we did not see the need to put -- to establish a new fab in the U.S. The second question is how do we protect our intellectual property against theft? Yes, this is the -- actually, this is the core of China-U.S. trade tension and we take it very seriously, too. And theft can come -- we call it espionage -- can come from everywhere, not just from one country or there are sometimes indirect come to the -- getting our proprietary information. I can only say that we are fiercely protecting our IP and information because those are -- IP information is originally developed TSMC over the past -- more than 30 years and that is ours. No other states can take it or -- and putting the effort to espionage. That is the main focus among all these tensions. Now we come back to the floor. The next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. So there's been quite a few questions today on advanced packaging and how that's sort of helping with Moore's law slowing down. If you look at these HPC applications, the move to parallel compute, the requirement to access high-bandwidth memory, that, I think, is a big part of the packaging trend. I just feel like packaging is going up in value, but so is memory, right. Is there a case to be made for TSMC doing more there either in terms of partnerships or in terms of own efforts? Or just comment on that space. You are right. We don't produce memory, neither DRAM or flash, but we work very closely with 3 memory houses, including Samsung and hynix and Micron. And all the engineering work together very closely and at this point, the engineering work is further intensified. And so -- this is our strategy is that we still want the memory supply can come from multiple sources for our customer so that they can most freely develop their product. And yes, there is -- among the 3, some of the memory companies work closer with us, but all 3 are working quite close with us to help our customer's product to get to their market, yes. Second question is on your ASP. If you look at the last several years, CapEx going up and now the CapEx intensity is coming down a little bit and yet you've got -- you could have big market share of 7-nanometers in the big market that is upcoming. What is the thinking here? Should we think that with lower cost that you're going to pass it on to the customers given that you are going to get to your ROE goals? Or how do we think about that? Bill, I thought you were asking about ASP and then you are also asking about how we deliver value to our customers? Sorry, I guess, my question is if you think about ASP with your -- last several nodes, ASP has been going up, right, but now that your cost structure is coming down, does that mean we should expect flatter ASP going forward? Okay. Do we share our cost-reduction benefit with our customers more than before, which is reflected in the price, that's what you're asking. I just realized last several nodes that the leading edge actually has been shrinking, right. And so now you've got a big market, your cost is coming down. If you're not going to raise price, principally benefit more because the size of the market might grow. Just how do you think about that problem, I guess? I still don't understand that you are talking about that is getting more mature so then the cost is down and so that's how we have to roll down our price? I'm sorry. I'm not being very clear. Just comment on ASP next couple of years, I guess? We sell the value. We don't sell by the cost, that's the first rule. And we work with the customer to make sure that their product can be sellable, feasible in the market. So that's all the rule of thumb that we consider. Okay. Next question will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. First question I want to ask on the 4 growth platforms, if you could give an update. Mobile, I think, in the past early in the year was flat or that was the expectation, now I think it came down. So if you could give your view now, that mobile platform expectation year-over-year? And then for the other three, an updated snapshot like how large HPC IoT and auto are for TSMC now? Okay, let me answer that. As I just mentioned, I think that because of introduction of the AI and 5G, so even we start to forecast that the mobile smartphone, the contribution to our growth will continue, but yes, one surprisingly good result from the HPC. So HPC's contribution now it will be comparable to the mobile phone and then followed by IoT and automotive. So that now is a 2 big contributor. We used to say mobile is 50%, now it's a little bit less than 50%. And then HPC will be closer to the mobile's contribution now in the course per se. Okay. But I guess, could you -- I think, HPC has been running -- or growing from 20% to 25% or just kind of the range now for HPC and then, I think, the last metric auto was about $1.4 billion. I'm not sure if you've given that IoT, but if you have kind of a rough -- just so we have a rough picture since that's the way we're looking at the business now? Well, you're asking a question through lens of the future. Look at it, high-performance computing today is 25%. We expect that percentage will increase slightly and mobile percentage will decrease slightly. And IoT and automotive, those are roughly about 6% or 7% of our business, but that growth rate is pretty fast, talking about 20 more -- more than 20% growth year-after-year. So that is our current picture of the growth and that is also why we see this as 4 growth drivers for TSMC. Okay. In the 6% to 7%, is that combined? Or each one? Each one. Okay. The second question I have on gross margin, following up to Steve's question, there's about 1.5% headwind in Q4 from 7-nanometer. But you're also guiding growth, again, in the fourth quarter based on the full year guidance. So do you expect you can offset the depreciation -- sorry, the 7-nanometer headwind with growth to keep margins at your similar levels? Actually, the headwind for 7-nanometer in the first quarter is 2.5%, not 1.5 percentage point because the volume is pretty big. 2.5% over the third quarter, okay. Over third, yes, you're right or 1.5% more than third quarter. Well, there are many factors and 1.5% is not that big, no?  There are -- things can be done if we improve the product mix if the utilization gets better and we have better cost efficiency, then you can get there, yes. So I'm not projecting that, but that's all the effort we'll be exercising in the company. Next question will be from CL Securities, Sebastian Hou. My first follow-up is to clarify what Mark just said on the HPC revenue growth, was it 40% last year, 25% this year? Yes, including the crypto. Okay. So if we look at the full year guidance for this year is high single-digit rate and if we take cryptocurrency out of it this year and last year, apple-to-apple comparison without cryptocurrency, what's the growth rate for TSMC -- what's the growth guidance for TSMC for this year? Still in the range of 5% to 10%? We don't have that number readily, but I think that for this numerical answer, maybe Elizabeth can relate to you after the meeting. Okay, great. And going forward, I think, you maintained a CAGR, compound annual growth rate, of 5% to 10% and that's including crypto or without crypto? That's including the crypto. But as we look at it today, the cryptos will be not in the factor, if you talk about 5-year horizon, but things can change. But at this time, we don't count on the crypto. So which means the noncrypto part of the high-performance computing segment, you're becoming more confident, can we say that? Yes. Okay. The second follow-up is on the mature node. If I calculate your 0.11-micron process nodes above, assuming that's on 8-inch fab, but I know you -- somewhat that you use [indiscernible] to manufacture those nodes. But presumably, 0.11-micron above node in the first half this year versus first half last year, the Y-o-Y is down by 8%, 9% U.S. dollar terms. So there's been a lot of industry saying about -- that 8-inch foundry is very tight, demand very strong, price high, et cetera, but we don't see that reflected on TSMC in the first half of this year. So can you tell us what's going on? It's actually -- you are talking about our 0.11-micron and above revenue decreasing. Actually, we are fully loaded in that 8-inch wafer fab. So that's why I mentioned in my statement that we are transferring some 8-inch wafers product into 12-inch wafers so that we can have more capacity to serve the customer. As for the revenue, I did not have exact number in my hand. We are -- but the wafer pricing is dropping. We did not -- I do not have an exact number in my hand. It look like it's 8-inches 0.15 and below. You're talking about 0.11 and below. I think that's the difference. So there are some undervaluation in that part from that point, yes. Okay. But you are seeing the wafer pricing is declining. Is it due to the product mix or like-to-like comparison?  Because we heard like some other -- your peers are raising price since the beginning of this year and maybe another wave of the price hike in second half. I don't comment on my competitor's behavior. But for TSMC, we actually -- we work with our customer and once we've settled on the wafer pricing, we have a commitment. We don't easily change that, okay. Even if we observe the roll wafer's pricing increase, that we stick on our commitment to our customer. Next question will be coming from Deutsche Bank's Michael Chou. The first question, you mentioned high-end smartphone units is stronger than expected, than 3 months ago, can I say that? Yes, you can say that. Okay. Is that broad-based or customer-specific? It's broad-based. Okay. Second question is more housekeeping. What's the outlook for the other segment Consumer, Industrial because you mentioned crypto and the smartphone? So you are asking the third quarter segment? Okay. In the third quarter, we see Communication improve, Computer decline the most, Consumer slightly decline, Industrial about flat. Next question will be from Citigroup's Roland Shu. Just one question. You have sufficient capital to fund your growth and also you are generating more free cash flow. So are you considering to do the share buyback? Or by what kind of criteria you are considering to do share buyback? Currently, it is not in our plan. Actually, we have done a very thorough study of how do we return cash to shareholder. I think the general feedback is our shareholder prefers cash dividend than buyback. Now we need to go to the line. Operator, please have the next caller on the line. Our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini. A couple of follow-ups. I noticed your wafer shipment in the March and June quarter has been rather flattish while revenue is down by high single-digit both in March and June quarter. Should we expect wafer shipment in the second half to be flattish? Or how should we think about the trend in the second half, and again, the trend between wafer shipment and the revenues, Q3 and Q4? And I have a follow-up. Wafer shipment in the second half will be increasing, will be higher than the first half so is the revenue. Did I answer your question? Would your inventories remain the same? You mean our own inventory? Yes, because your days of inventory has been coming up over the past 6, 7 months. Yes. Inventory mainly for TSMC is a working process and we had a 73-days inventory at the end of the second quarter. With the revenue of 7-nanometer, we expect the inventory will go up a few days in third quarter but will come down as we ship more 7-nanometer by end of fourth quarter. So our inventory are mainly working process. Okay. And then I have a question regarding the longer-term trend, specifically on artificial intelligence. Can you provide some qualitative assessment how you see the mix between GPU and ASIC evolving for the AI application? All right. Maybe your question is with respect to future artificial intelligence-related ICs. You want us to give you some sort of qualitative descriptions about the breakdown between GPU and ASIC? Yes, yes. And my -- the purpose of asking this question is I'm just trying to get a sense of how the market trends are evolving and also how we should think about the difference in the die size. I'm under assumption that GPUs generally are bigger dies compared to ASIC. And how should I think about this looking forward? Well, we can only say that AI will be implemented in the GPU, CPU area. Comment on customer's die size, no, we cannot comment on that, but is increasing, that we can say. And AI going to be used in a lot of functionalities anyway. Sure. Let me rephrase the question. Would the wafer capacity requirement for AI be different between GPU and ASIC? The wafer requirement? What... Wafer capacity requirement, does that make a difference for you, yes. So let me give you probably not exactly what you want. The biggest portion of high-performance computing today, in TSMC, is xPU followed by GPU, okay. In the high-performance computing... All right. Now with this very bright, long-term outlook of artificial intelligence, bigger die size, a lot of wafers, we will conclude our -- today's conference.
So please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 3 hours from now. Transcript will be available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through our website. Thank you for joining us today. We hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a good day.","TSMC's second quarter 2018 earnings conference and conference call will be webcast live through tsmc.com . the format for today's event will be as follows: first, the senior vice president and CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2018, followed by our guidance for the third quarter . meanwhile, the CEO, Dr. mark Liu, will jointly provide the company's key messages .",1.0

This is Elizabeth Sun, TSMC's Senior Director of Corporate Communications and your host for today. Today's event is webcast live through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. [Operator Instructions] As this conference is being viewed by investors around the world, we will conduct the event in English only.
The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Senior Vice President and CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2018 followed by guidance for the fourth quarter. Afterwards, Ms. Ho and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide company's key messages. Then we will open both the floor and the line for the Q&A.
For those participants on the call, if you do not yet have a copy of the press release, you may download it from TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. Please also download the summary slides in relation to today's earnings conference presentation.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. So please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC's CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of our operations and current quarter guidance. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter and followed by the guidance for the fourth quarter.
Third quarter revenue in U.S. dollar reached $8.49 billion, which increased 8.1% sequentially, reflecting customers' new product launches using our 7-nanometer and a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Third quarter revenue came in stronger than the revised guidance that considered the impact from the August 3 virus incident as we were able to make up most of the delay in shipments. In NT dollars, revenue increased 11.6% sequentially.
Compared with second quarter, gross margin decreased 0.4 percentage point to 47.4% as the unfavorable technology mix was partially offset by the profitability improvement in the back-end business, while the more favorable exchange rate offset the virus incident impact.
Total operating expenses increased by TWD 1.7 billion. The increase was mainly for 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer-plus development. Thanks to operating efficiency, total operating expenses represented 10.8% of revenue versus 11.3% in the second quarter. So our operating margin improved 0.4 percentage point sequentially to 36.6%.
On tax expenses, after a step-up in tax rate to 17.5% in the second quarter due to the accrual of retained earning tax, our effective tax rate fell back to 10% in the third quarter. We expect the full year tax rate to be about 12%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 3.44, and ROE was 23.2%.
Now let's take a look at wafer revenue contribution by application. During the third quarter, Communication and Industrial/Standard increased 24% and 6%, respectively, while Computer and Consumer decreased by 35% and 1%, respectively.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology contributed 11% of total wafer revenue in the third quarter. 10-nanometer accounted for 6%, while the combined revenue from the 16- and 20-nanometer accounted for 25%. Advanced technologies, defined as 28-nanometer and more advanced technologies, accounted for 61% of the total wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 604 billion, a decrease of TWD 145 billion from last quarter, mainly as we paid out TWD 207 billion of cash dividend, while we borrowed TWD 43 billion short-term loans for hedging purpose. Correspondingly, current liabilities decreased by TWD 141 billion.
On financial ratios. Accounts receivable turnover days remain at 38 days. Days of inventory decreased 1 day to 73 days due to stronger wafer shipment during the quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 94 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 70 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 24 billion. After we paid out cash dividend and borrowed short-term loans, cash balance decreased by about TWD 143 billion to TWD 489 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, the capital expenditure spent in the first 3 quarters of 2018 totaled USD 6.7 billion.
I have finished my summary of financial. Now let me provide you the fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 9.35 billion and USD 9.45 billion, which is a 10.7% sequentially increase, at the midpoint of the guidance. Based on the exchange rate assumptions of USD 1 to TWD 30.80, our fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be between 47% and 49%. Our fourth quarter gross margin -- our fourth quarter operating margin is expected to be between 36% and 38%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about the near-term demand, inventory, capacity and CapEx.
Now on the near-term demand and inventory. We conclude our third quarter with revenue of TWD 260.3 billion or USD 8.49 billion, which is above our revised guidance. According to the revised guidance, the computer virus incident on August 3 was estimated to have impacted our third quarter revenue by about 2% and gross margin by about 1 percentage point, respectively. However, we were able to make up about 75% of the affected shipments in the third quarter. So overall, our third quarter result was mainly driven by strong demand from product launches using our 7-nanometer technology.
Moving into fourth quarter, despite the current market uncertainties, our business will benefit from the continuous steep ramp of 7-nanometer for several high-end smartphones as well as the demand for 16/12-nanometer for the launches of new-generation GPU and AI. However, this growth will be partially offset by continued weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand and inventory management by our customers.
Fabless DOI exiting third quarter '18 was several days above seasonal level, slightly higher than what we expected 3 months ago. We forecast fabless DOI to continue to stay at this above-seasonal level exiting 2018.
Now let me make some comment about capacity and CapEx. At TSMC, we build our capacity according to customers' demand. We are continuing to increase 7-nanometer capacity to meet the strong customer demand. We reiterate our 2018 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion and USD 10.5 billion.
In addition, as I have talked about before, although our leading [ Aegis ] capital cost continue to increase due to increasing process complexity, we are able to offset its impact to our CapEx by productivity improvements and further optimization of our capacity planning. Going forward, we expect annual CapEx needed to support our 5% to 10% revenue CAGR in U.S. dollar terms in the next few years will continue to range between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion.
I conclude my remarks. Let me turn the microphone to C.C. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with 2018 year's outlook.
For the full year of 2018, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow between 5% and 7%, while foundry is expected to grow between 6% and 7%. For TSMC, as Lora has just indicated, that our second half of 2018 business will be strongly supported by the 7-nanometer ramp-up, which is mainly driven by a few new smartphone launches. However, our business is also negatively impacted by further weakening of cryptocurrency mining demand. As a result, we estimate our 2018 growth rate will be about 6.5% in U.S. dollar term, which is close to the foundry industry's growth but slightly below our 7% to 9% guidance given in the last conference.
Now let me update you about the August 3 virus incident. On August 3, TSMC experienced a computer virus outbreak, which affected a number of computer systems and fab tools. The infection was due to misoperation and insufficient firewall controls. We have since corrected this problem to ensure such viruses will not happen again in the future. Our remediate actions including the following: implementing an automated system to guarantee foolproof execution so that such misoperation will not happen again; enhanced firewall control for fab isolation; and network control to each individual computer. More enhancement now are ongoing, too, for further improved tool immunity against future infections. TSMC sets top priority for such security enhancement.
Now let me talk about the N7 and N7+ and the EUV's progress. TSMC's N7 technology is now available for customers to unleash their innovations. This is the first time in the semiconductor industry the most advanced logic technology is available for all product innovations at the same time. We continue to work with many customers on N7, N7+ product design and expect to see more than 100 customer product tape-outs by end of 2019. We expect 7-nanometer to be a long node and check multiple waves of customer adoptions.
N7+ is in risk production now. Since the N7+ has 15% to 20% better density and more than 10% lower power consumption, we are working with many customers for their second wave product design on N7+. Although the number of tape-outs today account for a small portion of the total 7-nanometer tape-outs, we expect the activity to pick up at a rapid pace in 2020 end of the year. Because the N7+ is using a few layers of EUV photolithography to have better cycle time and patent control, we have made a steady progress on EUV technology development towards high-volume production. Tool availability, EUV power, productivity, defect reduction, mask improvement, material and process optimization are all on schedule. A few customers has already made plans to adopt our N7+ in their 2019 products.
Let me move to our N5 status. Our N5 technology development is on schedule. We have completed the design solution development and are ready for customers' design start. The N5 risk production schedule in first half 2019 stays the same. Compared to N7, TSMC's N5 deliver 1.8x to 1.86x logic area reduction and close to 15% to 18% speed gain and ARM A72 core. We expect to receive first customer product tape-outs in spring of 2019, followed by production ramp in first half 2020.
Now let me talk about the N28, N22 and mature node strategy. Due to faster-than-expected technology migration from 28-nanometer to 16-nanometer and below, 28-nanometer's overcapacity becomes an industry-wide phenomenon, and it's expected to last for a few years. TSMC's mature nodes' strategy is to work closely with our customers to develop specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement. For example, we continue to develop 22-nanometer for scaling benefit and better performance. We are also developing 22-nanometer for CMOS imaging sensor, MRAM and RRAM. For all mature nodes, TSMC will continue to develop a variety of special technologies, such as power management IC, Embedded Flash, imaging sensor, MEMS, to maintain output capacity loading rate and to increase our technology value to customers.
Now let me talk about advanced packaging update. TSMC has been developing advanced wafer-level packaging technologies to integrated advanced SoCs memories, integrate the passive device to enhance system performance. We believe our advanced packaging solutions will contribute to our business growth. We are now expanding the application of both cohorts and aim for -- especially for high-performance computing. Most of the cohorts products require integration of SoC with High Bandwidth Memory, HBM, in 3D stack. We are making good progress in qualifying multiple HBM sources through close collaboration with customers and the DRAM suppliers. We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which stands for System on Integrated Chips, where multiple heterogeneous chip [ disk ] will be integrated with close proximity to deliver better performance. And we target to start production in 2021 time frame.
That's all my report, and thank you for your attention. Thank you. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] So we can start. Deutsche Bank, Michael Chou first. Two questions. One is, what is the outlook for 7-nanometer sales portion in 2019? Can you give some color at this moment based on your current visibility or some tape-out numbers? Michael, your question is what is the outlook of 7-nanometer... In 2019. In 2019? In terms of the sales portion or any indication. I would like to answer the question and say it's a very strong demand in all the play form, in all the market sector, which including the mobile phone, high-performance computing, that's included graphic, a lot of AI accelerator, FPGA, you name it. A lot of customer are working with us, as I just stated, and we expect 100 or more than 100 tape-outs -- product tape-outs in year 2019. So did I answer your question? Is it fair to say that 7-nanometer sales portion will be more than 20% of total sales for the whole year next year? Next year? Let me answer that. You have seen our report. The third quarter 7-nanometer accounts for 11%. The fourth quarter will be more than 20%. So for whole year 2018, 7-nanometer will contribute close to 10% of total TSMC revenue. Go beyond 7 -- 2018, and we will have very, very strong ramp in 2019 as well. We expect the revenue contribution will be much higher than 20%. Second question. C.C., you mentioned 28-nanometer oversupply in the industry could be a normal situation over the next few years. So will management consider converting some 28-nanometer to advanced node? I know you mentioned some specialty, especially PMIC in 28, CIS in 28, so -- which should be a good follow-up product. But would you consider to conversion capacity to advanced node? Good question, Michael. Actually, we are moving from 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer, which is a smaller geometry and more advanced. I think your question is, are we consider moving into 16, convert some of them? We keep the flexibility to moving the wafer around, so they can support each other. We already did that. So there are a lot of commonality in the tools, so some of that capacity -- or part of the capacity can support other technology node. So you mean that if -- for instance, if your 16/12-nanometer demand is beyond your estimate, so you can use some 28-nanometer to some 16 node product in the future? We have some tools that have a commonality, say, for example, implanter, right, and the cleanup and a lot of things. But let me stress again, I say the overcapacity for a few years, however, we are developing 22-nanometer, we are developing a lot of specialties. And for TSMC, this is only probably a couple of years we are going to fully utilize 28-nanometer again. Then is that fair to say your 28, 22 UTR over the next few years, that you are confident you can maintain maybe above 85%, about 90%? I'm not going to ask -- to answer this question. But after a couple of years, there will be the high utilization rate again. Next question will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. I wanted to ask a question about sales and also gross margins. The sales in fourth quarters is actually fairly good, factoring in the business environment. Could you talk maybe the forward view? You mentioned also fabless days of inventory may exit the year a few days high. So with the implication for our first half, especially relative to the last 2 years, we saw declines in first and second quarter. So if you have a view kind of the rate or magnitude of the decline relative to what you think normal or seasonal is after first and second quarter. Are we going to forecast the second -- next year's first quarter and second quarter? Initial view based on inventory and demand. We have very strong demand in 7-nanometer. Let me just continue to say that. For the last quarter of this year, you're talking about the profit margin, right? Yes, the second question on margin, I wanted to ask, it's about 1 point or 2 below the traditional, say, 49 to 50 target. Yes. And Lora cited product mix. Next year, 7 will be more mature. Do you think you have the catalyst to get back to that 49, 50 or other factors like 28 oversupply? Well, let me answer the -- your fourth quarter's profit margin is a bit lower than we usually have. That's between 49, 50. That's because of our product mix Lora just have mentioned. Product mix, one of the major reason is the 7-nanometers ramp up much faster than we thought. And the demand is very strong. And so that draw down our margin a couple of point. But I'll let the CFO to explain the number. C.C. mentioned about 7-nanometer being particularly strong compared with our other leading-edge technology in the past. It does dilute our corporate margin level starting from the third quarter this year. Going to the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, the revenue contribution will be 20% -- more than 20% of our fourth quarter revenue. And the margin for 7-nanometer at the beginning stage is still below corporate average. So the dilution in the fourth quarter will be more severe than the third quarter. Our estimation is between 2 to 3 percentage point for fourth quarter gross margin. Now going into 2019, SRAM will continue to be very strong, so we believe the margin dilution will be eased off when we reach to the second half of 2019. Okay. And maybe I'll just -- to follow up on that first one about sales, you mentioned 7 is very strong. But I guess, do you have a view that the rest of the business may be doing some further inventory adjustments in the first quarter? Lora? There are several days above seasonal this quarter. And going into 2019, I think inventory will be gradually digest when we move into the second half of '19. Okay. The second question I wanted to ask was about the 7+ versus 5-nanometer. You mentioned 2020 would see the very strong ramp-up of tape-out and activity in volume on 7+. Is it your view -- I think last conference, Mark said 5 was a little bit more conservative at this stage. So how's your view now for interest activity and expectation for a steep ramp-up of 5 into 2020? We still expect very fast ramp on 5. The reason is simple. Because of a lot of our product develop in the AI area, you need the speed, you need the lower power, and you also need a small footprint. So from this -- from today, we can see when we work with our customer, the ramp will be steep again. Okay. Do you think mobile will also contribute in that steep ramp? Still come from the mobile phone first, followed by other applications. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. I would like to follow up for this 4Q gross margin guidance. If I compare with 4Q last year, actually, we have a similar percentage contribution from this leading edge. Last year, 4Q 10-nanometer was about 25% of the total revenue. And in 4Q this year, actually, we have a favorable exchange rate compared to 4Q last year. And also, we have this improved back-end profitability. So how come we still have a lower gross margin compared to 4Q last year? There's about 2 percentage point difference this 4Q versus last 4Q, okay? So one reason is product mix issue. I'm particularly talking about 28-nanometer. Our 28-nanometer is very profitable, and the contribution to corporate revenue has declining from last year to this year. So these 2 reasons, product mix because 28 declining and also because the utilization of 28 is not full, yes. That's one reason that there's a new phenomenon. Okay. So how about the standout gross margin, does it change? Structural profitability is still intact, no change. Okay. And also last quarter, you talked about, for longer term, our financial objective for gross margin is 50%. So is this 50% a fixed number? Or this 50% is average for the upcoming few years? 50% is our goal. We aim to achieve that. If we can't have higher utilization, I am quite confident we can achieve that. Okay. So this year I think that probably we were not able to achieve this 50%. No, not... Because of the utilization? Not this year. And also because the 7-nanometer ramp is more severe than previous node. So first year dilution is slightly bigger, okay? Okay. My second question is AMD starts its 7-nanometer CPU from its server. And also, ARM recently also talked, they have this new brand server product. So is server CPU going forward to be a very significant part of our business going forward? It will be an important part. Significant? Maybe. So your 4-course play for smartphone, HPC, IoT and the automotive, and so this server CPU will be in HPC then? That's right. Okay. Can you just reiterate the growth breakdown for this 4 play for next year? Okay, let me give you some color on it. In the next few years, if we look at ahead, actually, the smartphone going to be in our daily life even more and more. So we have a 4-course engine: one is a mobile phone, actually, it's a high-end smartphone; second one is a high-performance computing; automotive; IoT. The mobile phone probably for TSMC will have a, in 5 years, a CAGR, if I look at it right from today, it will be mid-single digit is the growth. And all other 3 play form will have a very comfortably double-digit growth in the 5 years time frame. And so that's a -- did that answer your question? That's... Yes. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. First question is on China. So a lot of concerns about the trade tension, about the economy slowing down, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about what feedback you might be getting from your Chinese customers, both short term and long term? And short term meaning whether you're seeing any increasing levels of conservatism on ordering, on demand. Longer term, is there any change in the strategies of these Chinese customers in terms of perhaps less reliance on the U.S., et cetera? To answer your question, for the short term, we did not see any impact, if there's any at all. So our China customer, no, they did not change their behavior. So we continue to work with the customer to produce their product. For the long term, long term, due to the trade tension, your question is due to the [ tensions ]? Yes. Let me answer the question by another way. TSMC has been proud to be the everybody's foundry. So if there's a trade tension, if there is, and if it continues, I think that TSMC -- the impact to TSMC would be less or minimized because if -- we still need the semiconductor device, and TSMC is everybody's foundry, right? So whether they produce here or produce there, it's all TSMC's customer. Great. I know 2018 is not over yet, but if you think about the next couple of years, I know TSMC has talked about a long-term growth rate of 5% to 10%. Now I feel like more recently, you've talked a lot more about the progress on 7-nanometers. We all know about Intel's struggles with their process technology. And it's public information. They've announced it, right? So -- and then you've got some good design wins. Can you talk about your long-term outlook in 2019? Given these drivers you just said, out of the -- 3 out of the 4 new drivers will be above 10%. So are we looking at something more towards the high end of that? Or how do you think about that? We continue to say 5% to 10% growth rate. Probably I would like to -- following your question, I would like to say probably tends to be the higher side of that 5% to 10%. Does that answer your question? Yes. Next question will be coming from Daiwa's Rick Hsu. My first question is I know, C.C., you were talking about your more than 100 tape-outs for N7 and N7+. Can you give us a little bit more -- a little bit of breakdown? I would like to know how many tape-out for N plus and also what kind of application for that. Okay. In process, our tape-out -- product tape-outs, I'm talking about tape -- product tape-outs, is still a small percentage of the total N7 nanometer as a node, as I just mentioned. But then up to 2019, I expect that 2020, when the current customer, they start to design on their second-wave products, then there will be more of them on 7 -- N7+. So I don't have a specific number for you on 2020. Okay. My second question is, you also mentioned that your N7 will likely be another long node. So I presume it will be probably something like N28 in term of success. So my question is, in term of capacity build -- I know you don't have all the capacity number, but in term of capacity build, would you benchmark your N28 into more capacity number? We build out capacity according to the customer demand, and that -- I can assure you that. Compared with the 28-nanometer? Right. I cannot make any comment right now. Okay, next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So my first question is regarding the semiconductor inventory. So in which segment do you see more inventory? Because we are hearing lots of noise about automotive, industrial segment weakness and some call it CapEx cut, right? So can you give us some color about where do you see the inventory and also your 8-inch fab utilization rate? Well, I don't think we want to specify which product sector that have high inventory. But let me assure you that this year's -- at the end of this year, the inventory level actually as compared with the last year's same time is much smaller. So even we have some kind of inventory adjustment, I don't think the impact to the next year's quarter or next year's first half would be as severe as we saw this year, right? So that's all I can say because it's very dynamic. Lora, you want to add something? Just if I can add some color to your questions, if I look at the fourth quarter, we have just guided the 10.7% growth quarter-over-quarter. But looking at the segment, fourth quarter, Communication will grow very strong. Computer, small growth, lower than the corporate growth, so that area's relatively weak. Consumer is weaker, it's negative growth. And Industrial is a small decline. So maybe this can give you some color about the -- which segment has more inventory. Yes. So maybe this is also related to Bill's previous question, right? So when you analyze this inventory, customers' demand, do you think there is any impact from any macro factor, including the China-U.S. trade tension? Or it's just a normal semiconductor cycle? I will say it's just a normal inventory cycle. Okay. Yes, and next question is also related to the 7-nanometer plus, right? So you mentioned only a few tape-outs. But sometimes, one tape-out can be very significant to revenue, right? So can you give us some comments regarding the 7-nanometer-plus revenue contribution next year? No, I don't want to specifically say which one. I think at this point, we would like to turn the questioning to the callers on the line. So operator, could you please put the first caller on the line first? The first question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Just want to go back to your view on 2019, an interesting year because you have the migration from 4G to 5G, I don’t know, that can -- which could adversely impact [ tough ] demand, but you also have AI and the IoT ramping. How should we think about the mix changing? And would new applications and a continued share gain would enable you to actually offset any adverse impact as we migrate from 4 to 5G? Mehdi, in fact, we can only hear your voice in a discontinued manner. So could you please repeat your question again? Maybe keep your voice a little bit away from the microphone. Okay. Sorry about that. I'm just trying to better understand how you're thinking about 2019. It seems like there are many new projects that are ramping given the number of tape-outs at 7-nanometer. And we also know that in the smartphone market, we're in transition from 4 to 5G. In that context, should we expect new products, especially for AI and IoT, to get strong enough to offset any adverse impact from migration from 4 to 5G? So you want to repeat the question? All right. Let me try. I think Mehdi's question is that he is very positive about the outlook for us in 2019 because we have so many new product launches from our customers using 7-nanometer and smartphone is entering into a 5G era. And so he thinks that we may get a lot of new products in AI and IoT, which would be able to offset the migration from 4G to 5G. From 4G to 5G, well, that's a question. So looks like the question says -- indicate that 4G to 5G there will have a dip. Actually, it's not. 5G in 2019, we expect to start to grow, but not a significant number. So most of the phone -- the smartphone, I mean, it will be in 4G still in 2019. However, I mentioned about the AI and other product segment, yes, that will start to grow in 2019. And we expect a lot of new product other than the smartphone will contribute to 2019 7-nanometer business. Sir, could new product actually be big enough to help you with a 5% to 10% revenue growth? And I'm asking you this because this year, we have had adverse impact from customer inventory and cryptocurrency that impacted your overall growth target for 2018. But in '19, would new products offset any weakness that is associated with the mature products? Well, in 2019, as I just mentioned, the inventory correction will be much less, in fact, as compared with 2018, beginning of 2018. So definitely, our growth rate in the 5% to 10% would be much likely in the high side, that's what I say. Not only because of the... That's right, but... Okay. So Mehdi, accept our very positive outlook for '19, good. The next question is from the line of Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. My first question is on the China demand and capacity buildout. Could you talk a little bit about the progress of the buildout for N16 in Nanjing? What is the schedule for phase 2? And has there any change in plan both the weakness that we have seen in cryptocurrency demand for some of the Chinese customers? That's my first question. Can you repeat it? So Gokul's first question is he asks us to update our Nanjing fab's progress and he asks if we have any changes in plans to this ramp-up in Nanjing fab because of the weakness in cryptocurrency mining. Nanjing Chairman, you want to answer that? We had a 10,000 wafer per month installed capacity currently. And then we're planning to increase the capacity to 20,000 wafer per month next year. And we are developing customer as well as some derivative technology that are related to the 16-nanometer. So we have progressed as we planned. Okay. So my second question is on N7 and N7+. Now TSMC appears to be in the best position to comment about the benefits of EUV given that you have N7 and N7+, one in production, one under production. Could you talk a little bit about the kind of improvements that we are seeing either from the EUV perspective or reduction in mask layers, et cetera, and the impact in terms of overall cycle time for the fab comparing N7 and N7+? Okay, actually the question is about the EUV and how much of the benefit we can get from the EUV, right? Usually, if we are not using the EUV, sometimes for the very critical dimension on the N7, you have to -- or N7+, you have to use in the 4 layers of lithography to pattern one of the critical dimension. Now using the EUV, you're just using one layer so that you reduce the cycle time by 4x of photolithography, 4x of etch. Now you become 1 lithography, 1 etch. In total, how many layers we reduced? That depends on the customer's requirement, but usually I just give you a hint already, right, 4 layer can become 1 and we are replacing some of the 3 layers to become 1, and we have a few layers of that. So that give you a hint. Cycle time reduction, definitely because you do 4x into 1x, that's a big advantage. Productivity-wise, today, EUV is progress we will -- up to our expectation. And in fact, TSMC has turned on the 250-watt power and we believe we are the only one company continues to run the 250 watts EUV power so far today. Okay. Now we can come back to the floor. Next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. My first question is on the trailing-edge profitability and outlook. So a couple of your peers in the past 12 -- well, past 2 years have decided to not -- to stop going advanced. So now their strategy is to focus on the node they are already -- they already have. And China is also ramping up some trailing-edge technology capacity, so it seems they are more focused on there. And understand that TSMC, as we generate a lot of profit and cash flow from trailing-edge technology, so how do you see this dynamic going forward? Is there potential for you to -- for this to negative impact your trailing-edge profitability? That's the first question. Okay. Actually, I don't want to comment on my competitors' strategy. But let me, again, stress our -- but you all know there's a strategy. We continue to develop some of the specialty technology to meet the customer's requirement, right, I just stated in that. And yes, a lot of specialty technology we are doing, I give you some example already, power management IC, CMOS, MEMS, everything. So that will help us to compete with our competitor. Actually, this kind of specialty technology particularly we have to work with the customer. And so that's why I say working with the customer to meet their requirement. And that, in turn, to keep TSMC's business. And that's a way that we migrate the technology -- pure logic technology to the more advanced node. But for the existing capacity, we develop into the specialty technology. And so our strategy is still meet customers' requirement, but we don't increase the existing logic capacity. Right. But I thought TSMC has been doing this for a long time... Yes. So you'll keep doing this. But the real change is not what you are doing, but the real change is what your competitors, the dynamic, there are more competition threat from it? Well, we already have a lot of competition. Before they announced that, we still seem the other competitor, no doubt about it. Not because they dropped out some of the technology node they don't want to do, no, we are not going to change our strategy because of that. Fair. Second question is still on the node profitability. So I remember the rule of thumb for TSMC: node profitability is that -- N-minus-2 now usually have the very good or probably the highest profitability of -- for TSMC. So now we're already ramping up 7, so the N-minus-2 for you is 16. Understand that the 28 used to be very profitable, as Lora just said. So I'm just wondering if based on the -- assuming 16 and 20 -- we compare 16 and 28, assuming they are both depreciated at the same utilization rate, will 16 be more profitable than 28? Or similar? Wow, this is very specific, you asked the profitability. Lora, are we going to answer that one? I probably cannot quantify that, but we don't know whether you said N-minus-2 is the most profitable node is correct. But eventually, I think, as we continue to improve productivity and we keep very competitive specialty technology for the mature node, our margin will be all very good. Okay, let me ask from another perspective is that the -- some of this capacity on 16 or 20 was installed in 2014, '15, so which means that they will become fully depreciated very soon. So which means that these will become margin profitability tailwind for TSMC starting from next year and partially offset some of the 28 headwinds. Is that the right way to look at it? We certainly expect that, all right. You are talking about a fully depreciated tool to generate more profit. Yes, you can calculate. We have a 5-year depreciation period. Right. So which means that by the same time next year, regardless of the utilization rate or whatever pricing, 16 will likely to be more profitable than 28? Actually, TSMC's 28-nanometer is very profitable. And that is -- what should I say, you say 16 is better than 28? And I hope so, but I cannot tell you the true number. I think our profitability is not depending on which node is better than which other node. We want all the nodes to be very profitable.
Okay. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So after a recent industry consolidation, does that change anything like your bargaining power and also your thinking about the cash return? So what does it change your thinking about, for example, the payout ratio going forward? The industry consolidation. Industry consolidation? Yes, I mean, GLOBALFOUNDRIES exceed 7-nanometer and Intel seems to be struggling with their leading edge. So I would assume competition in leading edge is getting less, right? So in that case, maybe your bargaining power can increase and also you have more cash may free up to return to shareholders. I don't want to say that because of my competitor. Well, in fact, Intel is my customer, so we respect their performance, of course. But TSMC's strategy actually is working with the customer. And the way that I have a competition or I don't have a competition, that's independent of that. And so we think we offer a very good technology value to our customer. Customer are happy, so we are working together and growing the business together. I'm not going to tell you that's my pricing strategy, that's not in discussion. Okay. Yes, so your current payout ratio is around 60%, right? So in what kind of circumstance in the long term would you consider to revise your payout ratio to maybe 70% or even above? Actually, we have been paying around 70% in the past few years. And I have said many times, and with 5% to 10% growth, we are confident we can continue to generate increasing free cash flow. That will be the source for the increasing of cash dividend. Yes, so we're still within that kind of commitment. And next follow-up is regarding that EUV question, right? I know it could be too direct to ask about revenue contribution from 7-nanometer plus. But from another angle, what keep your customer hesitating to put down the 7-nanometer plus, right, because you mentioned a few tape-outs. Is there any concern about -- sorry, the throughput of EUV or capacity of EUV, what keep the customer hesitating about EUV adoption next year? No, let me give you some explanation. Because TSMC's 7-nanometer is very successful, so customer using the design on 7-nanometer first. But N7+ have some, certainly, have some advantages, right. We're using the EUV, you have a shorter cycle time. And I just say that it's kind of a better pattern control, so that means your critical dimension has been tightly controlled that help the performance also. So we expect the customer moving their second-wave product. A lot of them will go to 7 plus And have there any concern about the EUV's maturity, that actually is what you are asking. Yes. Everything sounds very decent, right? So what was the issue? Price or any issue? What's the issue? Okay. EUV progressed steadily to our expectation. But as compared with EUV photolithography, the maturity is not comparable, not yet, not yet. EUV is still climbing up and we hope that the productivity can be better and better. But today, not yet. You just look at how many debut we have and how many EUV we have, you know what I'm talking about, I mean, that in the industry, just in the industry. Okay. Lastly, if I may, right? I think AI semi has been a very topical growth driver, right? So I think the reason it is getting more clear that some SC claims their performance can be 8x better than GPU. Those are general purpose, right? So with now less of a new SC coming to light, do you think that is going to impact your overall AI semiconductor revenue? Or put it in another perspective, do you expect any reacceleration or slowdown of your AI semiconductor business in the coming year? I think the AI's application would be everywhere, actually, from the several edge server or to the end device, and that's just like the smartphone in everybody. So this kind of development is to our advantage because TSMC certainly have a technology leadership. In order AI would be effective, you need a very advanced technology for the highest performance computing. So I don't see the effect that you are talking about, this application is better than that so that affected the course or something. No, it will be continues to grow. And I expect this growth much faster than I predicted here. Next will be coming from Deutsche Bank as a follow-up question. Regarding the 7-nanometer tape-out next year. So C.C., can you give some color regarding the portion of 7-nanometer versus 7-nanometer plus EUV? So will customer shift to 7-nanometer plus EUV aggressively in the second half next year and into 2020? Your question is... You mentioned more than 100 tape-out numbers, right, for next year, by the end of next year. So would the majority of that be 7-nanometer or 7-nanometer plus EUV? Next year is still 7-nanometer. Because of 7 plus, we're working with a customer and some of the customer moving a little bit faster, some of them -- and for those customers already in the 7-nanometer, they are planning on the second-wave product in the 7 plus. Okay. So next year, I can say most of them are still in 7. But then activity will start to rapidly coursing on the second half. And then at 2020, that will be even grow faster. Okay. But for the whole year tape-out number, right, so can we say the 7-nanometer plus EUV tape-out number increase quarter-by-quarter through end of next year? Can we say that? Well, increase quarter-by-quarter, yes, you can say that. But it is still a smaller portion of the total 7-nanometer node. Okay. So based on the 7-nanometer plus EUV tape-out by customer planning, right, so can you expect that 2020, we will see very big volume in 7-nanometer plus EUV mass production and the revenue contribution? Because you mentioned increase quarter-by-quarter, right? So we're just trying to find out if it will become very big revenue contributor and -- yes. If I can forecast well, I mean, that one tape-out, especially for some of the application, it takes about 1 year to -- for ramp-up. So 7 plus will be increasing, but the revenue I would expect 2020, '21 start to see the big number. But not 2019, not the first half of 2020. Okay. How about second half next year? Do you think that, that will be huge? You continue to nail down the number. Sorry. Maybe... Okay. 2019, less than TWD 1 billion. Less than TWD 1 billion. That's good enough. All right. Hopefully next question will be better and it will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. So it's a bit more of a long-term question. Hoping to ask you about the R&D, and maybe this is both for Dr. Wei as well as Lora. If you look at Moore's Law, certainly not getting easier. If you look at the number of players that can share the R&D burden, I think it's getting less. And number three, TSMC is clearly ahead of the competitors now in terms of process development. So as you look out the next 2, 3 years, do you have to think about R&D increasing at a faster rate? We do seek to continue going on. The smaller geometry takes a lot of effort to develop the technology. But I would like to use TSMC founder's wording to answer your question. So long as some people can develop it, TSMC will be there. That's our commitment to the customer, all right? And in addition to smaller geometry, actually, TSMC also develop the wafer level's packaging, advanced packaging to help the customer improve their systems' performance. And we think we have these 2 opening heads, and so we are in a very good position to compete in that field. I guess, I'm not doubting TSMC's abilities to develop it. But I think TSMC has taken on more of the burden now, and you also have to add the cost for advanced packaging R&D as well, right? So I'm just talking about the cost. Yes. The cost? Actually, I would like to say the value of our technology, all right? That's what we discuss with our customer. The cost, we continue to working on it, and we hope TSMC has a capability and ability to roll down the cost as we already proven in the previous years. But I think Bill's question is whether or not R&D, as a percent of our revenue, will increase in the future because of our taking up a bigger burden. We might, but I cannot tell you that exact number. So that's a cost. All right. Follow-up question from Citigroup's Roland Shu. Just a follow-up question for the profitability, but I'm talking about the back-end side because since last quarter, you kept talking about that you have this improving profitability on back end. And also in second quarter -- in last quarter, you said on the back end, actually, was able to partly offset the lower gross margin from this poor product mix. But consider your back end, it's just a relative small part of your total revenue. So it has to be with a very good gross margin in order to partially offset the unfavorable product mix. So how does your back-end gross margin compare to your corporate average right now? Back-end margin is indeed improving, but we don't compare back-end margin with corporate average. Because back end, the nature of back end is there's a very high asset turnover and lower margin compared with wafer. So the overall investment return is pretty good. If you look at ROIC, it's very good. So we don't compare back-end margin with corporate average. So if our back-end revenue continue to increase, it may dilute a little bit of corporate margin, but overall investment is pretty good, okay? And we have seen our advanced packaging. The -- we continue to invest in capital, and we see more customer adoptions. So we are increasing the size and the business volume of the back end. And of course, we continue improving the productivity. So back end is -- will be accretive to TSMC going forward. Okay. So can we have the rough number of how much the revenue is coming from back end so far? It's around TWD 2.5 billion this year. TWD 2.5 billion? Does this include wafer bumping? Or is this purely from InFO and CoWoS? Including all the back end, that's including the wafer bumping, testing, InFO, CoWoS, everything. That's roughly a little more than 7% of this year's revenue. Okay. But Lora, you said on your -- if the back-end revenue is -- exceed a certain portion of the total revenue, probably, the corporate average gross margin will be diluted. So what is the ratio for the facility of the back end? No, the back end is only 7%. It's still low compared to our very big wafer size. But back end, I think the back end probably is cyclical because this is very concentrated on several segment. Cyclicality is more of an issue. But in terms of financial return, we have guarding our model. So we're not worried about them. Of course, we continue to improve the profitability. A follow-up question from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. Thanks for accommodating another follow-up, right? So I think because, this time, market weakness, so I need to delve and microscope on your comments on near term, right? So C.C., you previously mentioned that 2019 inventory correction in 1Q wouldn't be as severe as the beginning of this year, right? So I don't know why now you have this kind of visibility. You said because of customers' order behavior or what have you seen for the coming 1Q that can make your inventory correction less severe than the beginning of this year? You ask where I get those information to get the conclusion that next year, the 1Q inventory correction would be less... Severe than this year, yes. Less severe. That's interesting because of -- we work with customers, right? And though I just mentioned about those market segment, Communication, Consumer and Computer, and we look at that, we work with the customer and we understand their business, not 100%, but we understand quite well. And so we can do this kind of forecast. Okay. Yes. So is that fair to link the Industrial segment decline to the 8-inch utilization rate? Can I assume that the 8-inch utilization is not that full -- as full as before? Is that a fair assumption? You can repeat what I said to answer that question, all right? I mean, that's -- you're asking very specific, that utilization and the customers' demand. Actually, let me say that we are very optimistic because we work with the customer. As I said, we work with the customer. We understand their business. And going forward, we know that they are doing the inventory adjustment. But they also discuss about what they want in the 2019, which I'm not going to give you some forecast today, not yet. Questions will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. A follow-up on the advanced packaging. I have the impression that of this year, more than 50 7-nanometer tape-out, a huge part of that or a large portion of the customers will use our advanced packaging solution. So moving to next year, so our tape-out number will be 100 or 100 more on 7. So it's still that kind of -- the percentage was still the same, which means that the advanced packaging customers on 7-nanometer will also double. Let me answer the question that advanced packaging, that included CoWos and InFO. And the CoWos is for very high-speed performance, such as like wafer chip, such as some of the networking processor. So those are huge in CoWoS. And for the InFO, that a lot of them are using for the mobile phone business. So that I can answer you, but I cannot give you, say, which one. No, no, no, I'm not asking which one. I'm just asking there's still, for the next year, 100 tape-out, a large portion of this using our... Oh, okay, okay. Well, sorry that I misunderstood your question. So the next year, the InFO for the mobile phone application, well, some of them will move into the high-performance computing also because that will offer a little better cost structure. And the CoWoS continue to be the high end, so high-performance computing product. And we also introduced SoIC, as I just mentioned, that even much better system performance. So we continue to progress our technology. And that -- did that answer your question? Sort of. Well, anyway, my question is very simple, actually. I just want to -- I simply just want to know that the -- your earlier comments on the large portion of the 7-nanometer customer tape-out will use our advanced packaging. And now our tape-out number is like, based on your comments, it seems like double from this year to next year. So this large portion still apply on the double -- doubling the 7-nanometer tape-out next year. Is that right? Oh, I see. Develop one new back-end process -- packaging process, it actually will last for many years. So next year, so 7-nanometer or 7 plus application for those product are still using the InFO and also using the CoWoS, yes. And whether it will stop or not, I am not ready to answer that question yet. Okay. That's clear. Second follow-up is that I remember last quarter when, C.C., you talked about the 28-nanometer's outlook, you mentioned 2019 will come down and expect the recovery -- nice recovery in 2020 because of the 22-nanometer's adoption. So today, you just mentioned that you expect the overcapacity will be the norm for several years. So what I interpret is that it sounds to me, over the past 3 months, you've become more cautious, conservative on 28 compared to 3 months ago. Am I interpreting that right? You may be right because recently, a lot of capacity has imbued on 28-nanometer as compared with 3 months, 6 months ago, right? So that mixed overcapacity a little bit more severe than previously predicted. However, I would like to stress again, I mean, that the TSMC developed shrink of the geometry for customer to gain the benefit of performance and better density. We also develop specialties. So that's why I say that we have confidence a couple of years later that our 28-nanometer will enter into a new era with a high inflation rate again. Do you view those excessive 28-nanometer capacity or the more they expanded newly add 28-nanometer capacity is a real threat to you or they're non-event? I mean, their effective capacity or their... We always are competing in the market, whether it be overcapacity. But of course, let me answer the question directly. Overcapacity is not good for any player in this field, definitely. Okay? All right. I think given the consideration of time, we'll just have Randy Abrams to have the last question. Just one quick follow-up to that last line of discussion because just in the last few months on the 28, have you changed your view on the 16 migration? Because one factor -- some foundries, if they stop at 28, can address the 16. So are you taking a more aggressive approach? So is part of your view on 28 a view getting more positive on 16, and you're trying to encourage more customers to migrate to that node where there's fewer players? So your question is, are we going to repeat this kind of a 28 migration on 16? Well, just, in the last few months, are you also seeing one more customer's demand to actually migrate to 16? And is it also more your strategy with some competitors not moving on, you actually have less -- a bit less competition on 16 and below? Yes, we have less competition in 16 and below, yes. But then so long as you have one competitor, that's good enough, right? I mean that you have to work really hard to compete. Okay. But I guess, on the customer side, are you starting to see more -- as part of your 28 coming down, you're actually seeing more customers with an urgency or desire to actually do that shrink? So you're seeing any change in that cadence of customers moving from 28 to 16? Can you be more specific? Your question is... Just a view -- you're now -- you do feel like there's more capacity on 28. Yes. But flip side, are you seeing some of the demand you previously expected on 28 now shifting to 16 and 12? Oh, oh, okay. A lot of my competitor can do 28-nanometer. But not a lot of my competitor can do 16- or 14-nanometer, at least for today. And so far, we did not see the same phenomena as a 28-nanometer. Did that answer your question? Okay. Yes, just more about demand, do you see more customers now trying to make that shift to 16, so on the customer side? Oh, okay. We will continue doing this way, actually, that the customer migrate faster than we expected into 16, right? And you expect that in the 16 or 14 will migrate faster than we expected into 10 or 7. No, the question is now 28, you're more worried about oversupply. Is part of that from you're seeing more customers migrate to 16? Yes, that -- the answer is yes. And that they migrate into 10 and 7 also, so they're faster than we expected, yes. Okay. This will conclude our conference today.

And now I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC's CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. First of all, Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights, as usual, for the fourth quarter and a recap of 2018 for the whole year. Then after that, I will provide a guidance for the first quarter.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 11.3% sequentially to TWD 290 billion as our business benefited from the strong demand for our 7-nanometer technology, covering both mobile and high-performance computing applications. Gross margin increased 30 basis points sequentially to 47.7%, reflecting the absence of the virus incident that occurred in the third quarter and an improvement in back-end profitability, higher capacity utilization and the more favorable foreign exchange rate. These factors helped offset the unfavorable technology mix. Total operating expenses increased by TWD 2.7 billion, thanks to the operating leverage only represented 10.6% of the revenue versus 10.8% in the prior quarter. And operating margin increased by 40 basis points sequentially to 37%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached $3.86, and ROE was 24.6%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology continued to ramp strongly and accounted for 23% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. 10-nanometer was 6%, and the combined 16/20-nanometer contribution accounted for 21%. Advanced technologies, 28-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue, up from 61% in the third quarter.
On a full year basis, 7-nanometer contribution reached 9% of wafer revenue in 2018. 10-nanometer was 11%. And the combined 6/20-nanometer (sic) [ 16/20-nanometer ] contributions was 23% of wafer revenue. Advanced technologies accounted for 63% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2017.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the fourth quarter, Communication increase 27%, while Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased 2%, 35% and 3%, respectively. On a full year basis, Computer, Communication and Industrial/Standard increased 61%, 1% and 3%, respectively, while Consumer decreased 17%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 695 billion, an increase of TWD 91 billion from the last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 19 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days was 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 6 day to 67 days due to stronger wafer shipment during the fourth quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 189 billion cash from operations and spent $114 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 75 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 89 billion to reach TWD 578 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In the U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditure reached USD 3.7 billion and a total USD 10.5 billion for the full year CapEx.
Now I would like to give you a recap of our performance in 2018. 2018 was another growth year for TSMC as we continue to set new records in both revenue and earnings. Despite the weakening macroeconomic outlook and demand headwinds in certain end applications, our revenue grew 6.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term and 5.5% in NT dollar terms to reach about TWD 1 trillion. Main contributor was the strong demand for our 7- and 10-nanometer wafers. Gross margin decreased 2.3 percentage points to 48.3%, reflecting a lower level of capacity utilization, the unfavorable technology mix and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate during the year. Our operating margin decreased 2.2 percentage point to 37.2%, while we continue to increase investment in R&D for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Our effective tax rate was 11.7% in 2018, which was lower than 13.5% in 2017 due to lower retained earning tax. Full year earnings per share was $13.54.
On cash flow, we generated TWD 574 billion in operating cash flow for the whole year, spent TWD 316 billion or USD 10.5 billion in capital expenditure, leaving $258 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 207 billion or $8 per share in cash dividend, which is an increase of 14% from the 2017 level.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to the forecast first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect first quarter revenue to be between USD 7.3 billion and USD 7.4 billion, representing 22% sequential decline. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.6, our first quarter gross margin is expected to be between 43% and 45%. And operating margin is expected to be between 31% and 33%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about the near-term demand and inventory, CapEx and profitability.
Now on near-term demand and inventory, we conclude the fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 287.8 billion or USD 9.4 billion, in line with the guidance given 3 months ago. This result was mainly driven by the continued steep ramp of our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology. Concluding 2018, semiconductor, excluding memory, growth was 8%, while foundry grew 6%. TSMC's revenue grew 6.5% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, mainly due to strong demand for our 7-nanometer technology.
Moving into first quarter '19, our business will be dampened by the overall weakening of the macroeconomic outlook, mobile product seasonality and the high level of inventory in the semiconductor supply chain. Due to the overall softening economic environment, semiconductor supply chain inventory exiting 2018 stayed at a much higher level than seasonal, we expect the excess inventory in the semiconductor supply chain will take a couple of quarters to digest. And the overall supply chain inventory will gradually approach to the seasonal level around the middle of this year.
Now let me make comments about the CapEx. As I have said it before, we believe USD 10 billion to USD 12 billion capital budget will be sufficient to support our average growth of 5% to 10% per annum in the next few years. Given the macroeconomic outlook in 2019, we are tightening this year's capital spending by several hundred million dollars to a level between USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion. That said, our commitment to support customers' product ramp remain unchanged. Out of this USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion CapEx for 2019, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, which includes 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. A little more than 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies. So this is about CapEx.
Let me follow on by making some comments about our profitability. Okay, as I stated in our first quarter 2018 earnings call, I said TSMC's profitability is determined by the following 6 factors: number one is leadership technology development and ramp-up; and pricing; and cost reduction; and capacity utilization; and foreign exchange rate; and last one is technology mix. All these factors, except capacity utilization, determine our standard gross margin.
I have just guided first quarter gross margin to decline by 3.7 percentage points sequentially, at the midpoint of the guidance. This is primarily attributable to a lower utilization due to the overall weakening macroeconomic environment and the mobile product seasonality and the high level of inventory in the supply chain.
Due to the recent changes in high-end smartphone business condition, our 7-nanometer capacity will see a substantial cutback on utilization rate in fourth quarter -- in first quarter and second quarter, which is expected to hit our gross margin by more than 4 percentage point each quarter. Going forward, to better manage our leading-edge utilization rate, we will be working closely with customers for more effective capacity planning.
Looking at other profitability factors for 2019. Our 7-nanometer ramp-up remains very strong. We continue to provide value to customer and drive aggressive cost reduction. In the meantime, we are increasing our resource in specialty technologies development to backfill our mainstream technology capacity. With all the above factors, we expect our gross margin in the second half of this year will be better than first half. And we believe our long-term gross margin target of about 50% is still a good target.
Thank you for your listening. Now let me turn the podium to C.C. for his mark -- remark. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me start with our 2019 full year outlook. We forecast a slowdown in global GDP growth from 3.2% in 2018 to 2.6% in 2019 due to the weakening macroeconomic conditions leading to a dull growth for the semiconductor industry. For the full year of 2019, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, will grow 1%, while foundry growth will be flat.
For TSMC, we estimate our business will grow only slightly in 2019 given the slowing economic environment. Our 2019 business will be supported by the continuing demand for our 7-nanometer, where we see stronger interest from our customer in high-performance computing, mobile and automotive.
Even with a slow year like 2019, we firmly believe AI and 5G are the megatrends that will drive the future semiconductor growth. And we reaffirm our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR.
Now I will talk about our 5-nanometer status. Our N5 technology development is well on track, with customer tapeout schedule for first half 2019 and volume production ramp in first half 2020. We are already in preparation for N5's ramp. All applications that are using 7-nanometer today will adopt 5-nanometer. In addition, we are expanding the customer product portfolio at N5 and see expanding addressable market opportunities. We expect more application in HPC to adopt N5. Thus, we are confident that N5 will also be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7 and N7+. Our 7-nanometer has been a very steep and successful ramp in second half 2018, and we expect continued ramp through 2019. Our customer portfolio is growing stronger while more applications such as HPC and automotive are coming to N7 as well. Customer tapeouts activity at N7 continue to be strong despite the cautious macro outlook. We are actually seeing increase in silicon content for AI and 5G-related product designs. We expect the 7-nanometer to contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in 2019.
Our N7+ yield rate is progressing well and comparable to N7. N7+ volume production is scheduled to begin in second quarter this year. As I have stated before, we are working with several customers on N7+ to support their second- and third-wave product designs. And we expect the N7+ contribution to the 7-nanometer family will grow increasingly larger over the next few years.
Now I will talk about TSMC's mature node strategy and our new 8-inch facility. For mature nodes, our strategy is that we do not increase larger capacity at mature nodes, but rather, we work with customers to develop specialty technologies that create differentiated and longer-lasting value to customers. Our recent plan for an extension at Fab 6 in Tainan is a part of this strategy. The extension is not an increase of wafer capacity per se, but the purpose is to increase the clean room space for more specialty tools. With successful execution of our mature node strategy, we believe we will be able to continually deliver good profitability in the future.
Finally, I will talk about our most important growth contributor in the next 5 year. As I just stated, we believe 5G and AI will be the megatrend underlying the ubiquitous computing which will drive the semiconductor growth in the future. With the successful ramp of 7-nanometer, we are able to expand our customer product portfolio and can add applications related to PC and tablets to the HPC platform. With this inclusion, we believe HPC will become the largest contributor to our business in terms of revenue growth in the next 5 years.
Thank you for your attention. All right. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to limit your questions to 2 at a time to allow all participants opportunity to ask questions. Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]
Now let's begin the Q&A. First question will go to -- will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. The first question I had was on the guidance both for the sales and the CapEx. You're lowering sales outlook to just slight growth but only making a small change to CapEx. Could you talk about the assumptions you're making for further market share gains or demand recovery and also the assumptions for 5-nanometer and EUV to keep the CapEx intact? Okay. Good afternoon. I want to say Happy New Year again. Yes, welcome to the investor conference. Your first question, I would like C.C. to answer. You're asking about we'd only grow slightly, but CapEx did not decrease dramatically. Good question. We now become more conservative on CapEx. It's because of we forecast a slower -- a lower 5-nanometer's demand at the initial ramp. However, we still have to prepare enough capacity to support our customer. And we believe that today, with lower than a few hundred million U.S. dollar is to reflect the reality of expecting the high-end smartphone a little bit slower growth. But this year, this year is because of 7-nanometer's capacity has been good and that the demand -- actually, we forecast the number of the units of the smartphone, especially high-end smartphone, to be negative growth. Although we are -- I still want to say that for TSMC, the year-on-year from 2019 compared to 2018, the smartphone -- the mobile business, we still grow slightly on this year regardless of the unit is dropping, okay. And as a result, we expect -- as I just said, we expect the foundry business will be flat, but TSMC still grows slightly. Yes, one follow-up to that, and then I'll ask a second question. For that capital spending change you mentioned on EUV, could you talk now about kind of magnitude and steepness? Like what type of ramp we should expect next year for that node? And on the CapEx, are you making any consideration with the slower environment to reuse more equipment? So that's a follow-up to the first question. Yes, we do expect that we, in the 5-nanometer, will use some of the 7-nanometer's equipment. To answer your question more correctly, actually, that why it's only dropped a little bit, a few hundred million U.S. dollar, because of an EUV tool, actually, we already buy a lot, all right? And we expect that one to continue to grow also. So the ramp-up of the 5-nanometer now definitely was slower than we expected, but we still think it's a long-lasting node because of all our customer who are using 7-nanometer today are engaged with TSMC today in their product design. So -- and in addition to that, we also increased our product portfolio, our customers' product portfolio. And that will be -- add something to HPC application. So look, it's not a blurry promise in this year, but we still have the confidence that 5% to 10% CAGR will be sustained. Okay. I'll change -- the second question, but I'll follow up one more. For the 5-nanometer, if you could just talk a little bit more what's driving some of the change in consideration, if it's anything about the EUV readiness versus cost structure, mature 7 versus 5. Maybe if you can go into if now you expect a bigger 7 initially and what the factor for that is. Let's talk about EUV's readiness. We are progressing really well. So that's why I said the 7+, which are using the EUV, was started -- will start the production in second quarter this year. And our 5-nanometer's technology development, a lot are based on the EUV's progress. And 5-nanometer's technology development is on track. So that's one thing. And why we draw down our CapEx is because of we expect the high-end smartphones' growth will not be as strong as we used to project before, okay? We're already down a little bit, but still, we still see that the high-end smartphone will grow is because of 5G and AI's application. I guess the question was more EUV, for it to be slower than original, maybe what drove the change to the EUV or to the 5-nanometer? I did not say the EUV will be slower. 5-nanometer? 5-nanometer, no. It continue. We -- the CapEx this year, majority of it is spent on 5. It's not even 3-nanometer. EUV's productivity continued to improve. And that modulate the CapEx we need to invest. So from the number, we are very confident that our 5-nanometer will ramp according to our previous plan. However, we do put a more conservative -- tighten up our CapEx under the -- those confidence to improve the productivity and make sure the lead time is tightened up enough to minimize the CapEx. Okay. The lower 5-nanometer initial ramp though, could you talk about that, like what's the rationale for that lower initial 5-nanometer ramp? Okay. Well, I just said we expect a higher growth. But right now, we are -- will be more conservative on the high-end smartphones' growth. 5-nanometer's ramp? Yes. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. First question is, C.C., you've said for the mobile business this year, you still expect some growth. But under your overall year, on the whole year, revenue grows just slightly. So how about the growth for your -- the other platform product, IoT, HPC and the automotive? Okay, Roland, you asked a good question. Smartphone grows slightly. IoT grow double digit. Automotive will be flat. HPC, if we're excluding the cryptocurrency mining, HPC also grows slightly. But cryptocurrency is a big drop from 2018 to 2019. So if we put the cryptocurrency together in the HPC, it's a big drop. It's almost a double digit. Okay. May we have more color for the breakdown for this 4 platform, the revenue breakdown in last year, in 2018? Last year. This one maybe, Lora, you can directly answer it on the number. For 2018, smartphone roughly accounts for 45% of our wafer revenue; HPC, about 30% -- 32%; IoT, single digit, 6%; automotive, 5%; digital electronics, 6%; and there's other, 5%. Okay. And may I know how big are the contribution for cryptocurrency last year? A lot. We don't want to specify too much on the segments, particularly it belongs to one of the big customers. So... Okay. And the other question is Lora said about 7-nanometer utilization will be dropped a lot in first half. But the whole year, the 7-nanometer revenue contribution, a comment by C.C., will be about 25%. So that means that -- or above 25%. That means the second half, the 7-nanometer contribution will be very strong. So may we have more color? What kind of application is driving such a strong 7-nanometer demand, in 7-nanometer? Okay. A lot of it because of seasonality of the high-end smartphone. So in the second half, we expect to ramp up the high-end smartphone again. The first half is a little bit kind of cyclical in the high-end smartphone. To be honest, this high-end smartphone drop in the first quarter is -- came a little bit sudden, so the inventory in the supply chain is quite a lot. So that may push the first half drop. But the second half, we expect the new product launching will carry on another wave of ramp. So Roland, I'll give you more color. How about that? In the second half, we already said that we have more customers' product portfolio. So that will expand into the high-performance computing. Some of the product will enter into production slightly from first quarter and extended to the next year. For the 7-nanometer follow-up, I think 7+ will be also included in the whole 7-nanometer. N7+ total revenue will be still somewhere around the TWD 1 billion. That's correct. 7+ is not a major node, but rather it is a technology good for second-wave and third-wave customers. So it is -- come up slower when the first-wave product or first-wave customer ready to convert to the lower -- to another improved version. So it doesn't conflict with our 5. 5 is another major node. Next question will be coming from Goldman Sachs' Bruce Lu. So I want to ask about like smartphone semi content addressable market. TSMC management used to provide that, some semi content growth for high-end smartphone, medium-end smartphone and low-end smartphone in the past. Can we ask like what kind of like semi content growth in the coming 1 or 2 years would be like in different segments of smartphone? And also, what kind of semi content growth for smartphone moving from 4G to 5G, especially for the addressable market for TSMC? If we want to specify what is semiconductors' content into the high-end smartphone, actually, you want me to untangle a specific number just like before. I don't think we can do it today because of there's a lot of application -- new application that are in 2, not 1, such as AI and something. We expect in the future, AR/VR will be inside. The second thing is 5G, it is here that increased a lot and frequency band, and so that will add the silicon content inside. I'll give you a kind of feeling that the smartphone unit will drop a few percentage, but TSMC will still grow the smartphone business. So that means a lot of increase in that revenue is because of silicon content in terms of the smartphone business. But moving to 5G, as you mentioned that there are a lot of RF content, those kind of semi content increase. Do we see that having any impact to our business? You could -- you have a good question. Yes, moving into 5G, then the RF become more complicated. And so you have to add more chips or add more larger area in the RF chip. And so we expect silicon content per se, that will increase. And so the silicon in -- the content in the smartphone will increase. That's true. But can we somehow quantify the number? Not very... Let me put some color. I mean, this is based on, of course, the forecast number, so nothing -- may not be accurate. But we have a picture about the silicon content supporting C.C. Wei's description. On a high-end smartphone, we'd see the silicon content increase. Actually, it's increased every year very fast. On the mid end, it will increase slightly. On the low end, it's less predictable, but we take the model currently is decrease slightly. So that's the picture. And most of our business in the smartphone is -- belongs to the high end, so we are going to enjoy the silicon content with the equipment of our technology, leading-edge technology. Okay. My second question will be that management just mentioned that the 5% revenue growth CAGR will maintain. I think management first mentioned that in 2017. And with like slower growth in 2019, if you do that after math, you can now expect that more than double-digit growth for the coming 2 years. You can calculate it. Do I read it correctly? I want to reaffirm that the 5% to 10% CAGR was sustained. That's -- we have confidence on that. And you calculate it. Okay. So the 5-year time frame is 2017 to 2021, right? Yes. All right. Next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. My first question is I'd like to get TSMC's brains on the overall semi-cycle inventory. Remember, 3 months ago, the company talked about that you are not too worried about the inventory situation compared to the 4Q '17. But today, you're talking about -- or you just talked about that there's a lot of excess in inventory out there. So I'm just wondering what has happened in the past 3 months. Is it more due to demand slowdown a lot, or it's still more due to there are some hidden inventory now they emerged? I will say it's more due to the sudden drop in the demand rather than there's some hidden inventory that we did not see. Okay? Okay. Then can you elaborate more on the -- which application, which end application has seen the most significant decline in demand? High-end smartphone is one thing. And then others seeing the drop are largely, essentially, you can imagine that cryptocurrencies mining that dropped quite a lot. And then related to that one, this might be some of the high-performance computing that you can see from other applications that related to the cryptocurrency mining. Okay, got it. And in terms of the inventory digestion, I think Lora talked about that the inventory will go back to more seasonal average level by mid of this year. So usually, the downcycle, we will likely see the -- we usually see the supply chain will tend to overcut inventory to below normal. So is the mid this year, is that -- or it means that we already -- or is the below-normal level came before or after that? We expect to be at reasonable level, that it can sustain the business. And we expect that this kind of a demand will recover gradually from first quarter, second quarter and then moving to the second half of this year. So that's why we expect at mid--- in the middle of this year, all the inventory will go back to the reasonable or seasonal level. Whether it will be much lower or something like that, we did not expect that yet. Okay. Just one last question from me is that if we compare this downcycle to the past, the current -- I know that TSMC has not offered utilization rate details for many years already. But just to give us a rough idea, at the current utilization rate you are seeing now in first half of this year compared to the UTR we've seen in 2015, 2012, or say post the financial crisis, is it likely to be the lowest point that we've seen since then? This -- as Lora just presented, the utilization impact this quarter is really mostly coming from 7-nanometer. Although other nodes' utilization is lower, but if you compare with the last downturn, if you take 2009 for example, it's not that low. So our 7-nanometer really is major underutilized. We think it's temporary. So can we assume -- is it fair for us to assume that the UTR, certainly not as low as the 2009 yet, but it is already lower than what we've seen in 2011, '12, that cycle, and also 2015 cycle? You are right. You are right. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. First question is we've seen a pretty sharp drop-off in demand. And Dr. Wei, I think, made a comment that in the future, we will work with customers to plan for capacity differently. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that as far as what can be done. Is it more -- is it better planning? Is it diversification? Is it different payment terms? Can you just talk a little bit about what are some of the things? Well, in fact, this is kind of the way we deal with our customer. So it will be a better planning process. TSMC as well as TSMC's customer, I believe that we are learning a lot during this cycle and then we'll be more prudent or help find ways that TSMC and the customer can work together for the better planning of the capacity in the future without -- to summarize in one wording, we will be more conservative. But again, we will not lose our support to our customer. Wider product portfolio is another factor you mentioned. Great. Second question is for Lora. Can you talk about the depreciation for this year? And I'm asking that because I feel like TSMC over the last year, 1.5 years has bought quite a few EUV tools. And I believe you don't depreciate until these tools are in production, right? And so if you look at the CapEx trend versus the depreciation trend, is there a different linearity because all of a sudden the tools you buy, I don't know, 10, 15 tools, need to be depreciated? You're right. We start depreciated the tool when it gets into the productions. The depreciation pattern versus the CapEx changes is not linear, also because the -- whether the CapEx is front-end loaded, back-end loaded, also will impact the whole year depreciation. But I can tell you based on the USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion CapEx for this year, we expect the depreciation will increase by mid-single digit, which is versus last year was double digit, yes. So you see, it's all about USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion, but depreciation change can be quite different. Yes, sorry. I need to walk through the math a little bit. But what is that assuming for, I guess, 7+? Because I just want to figure out the next couple of years, as EUV ramps up, are we going to see a pickup? Or how does that work? I don't recall. I remember there is a sudden increase and it's a small modest increase year-over-year. All right. I think it's about time that we should go to the line for the questions from analysts waiting in the line.
So operator, could you please have the first caller on the line? Yes, the first question is from the line of Brett Simpson of Arete Research. I did have a question on inventory levels. Can you help maybe frame where the industry inventory levels are at the moment, maybe in weeks or inventory days versus a quarter ago? And what would you say is normal inventory levels in weeks or days, just so we can look at -- we can frame exactly how elevated the inventory levels are at the moment? Can you repeat the question? Brett, I think you probably talked too close to the microphone, so I'm not hearing you quite well. But I think you are asking the inventory level. The excess inventory that we see it now versus we saw 3 months ago, and you like to have a little bit color on that difference. Is that your question? Yes. And also just to understand what normal inventory levels are continuously. What's the normal level? 3 months ago, we estimate the inventory exiting 2018 is several days above seasonal. Now we look at it more like 10 days above seasonal. Okay. And you said smartphone seasonality was also going to be a weak event in Q1. What are you suggesting the Communication division will do in Q1 versus Q4 revenues? Well, I think the main reason is because of high-end smartphone seasonality. So that's -- and typically, Q1 is a low season for the high-end smartphone. But this kind of high inventory is because of a sudden drop from the 4Q last year and extended to the first quarter this year. And that's why the inventory started to increase so much. Did that answer your question? Can you help maybe quantify -- can you perhaps quantify how big a drop in Q1 your Communication revenue will be because of the smartphone seasonality? Okay. Lora, would you answer this? So you're asking the -- by segment, how do we see the changes in first quarter. Communication in the first quarter will drop the most followed by the Computer. Consumer actually will grow slightly and Industrial/Standard will grow very significant. So I think the decline in these sector are all double-digit decline in the first quarter. Okay. And one last question on 7-nanometer, what percent of sales in Q1 do you expect to come from 7-nanometer? And you're suggesting a very strong 7-nanometer ramp in second half when the industry gets back to normal inventory levels. Is there a risk that demand for 7-nanometer exceeds supply? And to what extent can you get customers to approve and order 7-nanometer and start ramping earlier in, say, Q2 this year? Are you going to repeat the question? We're trying to understand your question. So you're asking us about 7-nanometer since we said that there's going to be a strong cutback on 7-nanometer. You -- are you asking what percentage of 7-nanometer is part of our Q1 revenue and then what will be the level in the second half for 7-nanometer? Yes. Let me answer. Let me try to clarify the ramping of 7-nanometer this year. We already ramped the 7-nanometer last year and that's our first generation 7-nanometer. Coming to the first quarter, the 7-nanometer composition is about 21% of our corporate revenue already. Now this year, we are preparing to ramp the second generation 7-nanometer. We don't have a specific name, different customer have different flavors. But overall, it's their second generation product to be launched this year. So all the 7-nanometer number for the second generation will be drastically increased during this ramp in the second half of this year. I'm sorry, just to clarify, can you indicate what 7-nanometer as a percent of sales might be in Q1? And does this mark the trough for 7-nanometer in 2019? Question is what's the percentage of 7-nanometer in our revenue in Q1 and whether or not that percentage is the trough, is the lowest for this year. Lora, can you answer that? Okay. Mark just mentioned the 7-nanometer accounts for 21% of our first quarter revenue. We see that percentage of total revenue will continue to grow. So I will say that percentage-wise, first quarter will be the trough. Next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. I have one follow-up regarding your high-performance compute expectation for 2019. I believe cryptocurrency accounted for only a few percentage of overall revenues in the first half of '18. So why is that there's still an overhang on your HPC revenue mix? I believe you said including crypto, it will be -- HPC will be down double digit, and I'm just trying to better understand how it has changed from '18 to '19. And I have a follow-up. So Mehdi, I think you are asking us about HPC this year, if crypto accounted for a few points of our business in 2018 and how much crypto will be accounting for our business in 2019. Yes. Okay. This year, we don't forecast -- we become conservative in forecasting this volatile business. So the cryptocurrencies mining this year is much, much less than last year. And to what percentage, I don't think it's -- I can't release it right now. It is a conservative... I think what ramp... This is a conservative estimation of cryptocurrency. I think what I'm confused about is if you have had a new HPC customer program, how come those ramps are not enabling you to ramp HPC in 2019 better than just slightly up? So Mehdi's comments is that if we have this expanding customer portfolio in HPC, why is it that HPC, excluding crypto-mining, can only grow slightly this year? All right, good question, it's because of our customer -- we expand in our customer portfolio and product portfolio. But their ramp was starting from probably in the second half this year with a small volume and then going to the mass production next year. That's why this year, we saw just a slightly increase on the HPC business excluding the cryptocurrency. Okay, very clear. And my second follow-up has to do with the 5-nanometer ramp. And I'm trying to better understand your visibility and tapeout engagement. Should we expect a 5-nanometer ramp in 2020 to look more like a 7 or is that going to be steeper? Any color will be appreciated. Why don't we comment on that? 5-nanometer are ramping 2020, I would expect that product portfolio is expanding more as compared with the 7-nanometer since -- in 2018. How much of a steeper of that one, it will be similar or probably we're a little bit conservative. But today, we saw the better product portfolio, better customer portfolio, but steeper ramp probably very similar. Sure. Should we assume that 5 would become bigger than 7 in 2021? Is that have been the true benefits of 5 and the customer diversification that will materialize? From today's situation and the customer we engage with, yes, 2021, 5-nanometer will be bigger than the 7-nanometers same period of time. All right. Let's come back to the floor.
Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So my first question is about smartphone semi demand for this year. Because the management attribute the weakness in 1Q to the seasonality. But do you see any structural issues, for example, the last year replacement cycle leg of assets issue of the smartphone semi demand? And also, I cannot really get the math, right, because the high-end smartphone, even it's a higher content, it should contribute more of your revenue. But you're assuming this segment will decline and units will decline, right, so why can you get a number that a full year mobile revenue can still grow slightly? Good question. Actually, high-end smartphone this year, at least for the first half, it still have some kind of inventory issue. But in the second half, we expect the new model coming out. It's ramping up starting from the second quarter and all the way to the end of this year with a new model coming out. However, the total units as we expected or we forecasted, that one will drop slightly. The content will increase more than the unit drop in the percentage-wise. So TSMC still grow slightly on the mobile business, that's why. And your question is... Yes. So I just want to get a confidence why you think, second half, that recovery could happen, right? Because it's possible that a new product disappoints again, right? And also, yes, if I can get more color, do you think it's kind of a specific brand issue or is that kind of across different brands of that kind of a high-end smartphone demand issue? All right. Second half -- that's a good question also. Second half, why we still expect a recovery because we have a better customer portfolio. That all I can say. Okay, that's fair enough. So I would assume some market share again there. And also I want to follow up the previous question regarding HPC, right? So because compared to your previous targets to grow 20% year-on-year every year for HPC, I feel like, except for crypto, there is also some demand issue, right? For example, I'm not sure what you will see the demand in AI, cloud and those telecommunication, right? Because there -- that will be some demand issue to get only kind of slightly growth for HPC versus your targets of 20%. Can you comment on the demand? Okay, let me comment on that. We used to be very optimistic. We're still very optimistic because of the AI and 5G. But AI and 5G -- AI is picking up, 5G was started from this second half, start to install some of the base station, the infrastructure was started to build up. So we did not expect the 5G smartphone will be a big number this year. It will be a big number next year. And all the smartphone, we expect that the AI will be included inside with some kind of a content that we did not get the full picture yet, but we know is increasing. And you are talking about HPC, we used to say the 20% CAGR. Did we say that? This last year and the year before. Oh no. The last year compared with a year before because there is one uncertain -- not one uncertain, one surprise that's called cryptocurrency mining. It suddenly increased dramatically. And TSMC, because of our technology offering, so we have to say that we are the -- we get most of the benefit of the cryptocurrencies mining business. Now you saw volatility drop. However, without the cryptocurrency, we still see strong momentum on the high-performance computing: one, because we have very competitive or actually we are, I want to say, the industry-leading technology that which fit the requirement of HPC business; second, again, I would like to say we have a stronger customer portfolio. Let's look beyond 2019, right? So for 2 or 3 very high growth profile segment, HPC, IoT and auto, in those, I'm also very surprised your company is only flat year-on-year, right? So for coming maybe 2 or 3 years, what do you think should be the right CAGR for HPC, IoT and auto? I think the strongest growth is high-performance computing. The second strong growth in terms of the dollar increase is still smartphone, yes. So in terms of dollar increase. But auto, you got those kind of EV -- I'm not sure how you classify the autonomous driving, right? But auto I think used to be kind of a segment the company expect a strong growth. Why this year, we don't see... Yes. Auto, if you look at the past 2 years, a very strong growth, 27%. But as you know, that since last year, suddenly the automotive markets almost stopped growing. Many of our customers say the same thing very consistently, and some of them has to attribute to the steel and aluminum tariffs. And that is a -- I think is the structure of the automotive. In terms of the long term, we still see the innovation of automotive will come out of this, yes. So yes, I guess one question from lots of investors. Yes, so it's about dividend payout hesitation, right, because comments was to steadily grow every year, right? But it happened over the past 2 years, EPS growth that was around 3% every year; and this year, I'm not sure, right, it will be flat, right? So does the company think that this year you want to increase the dividend dollars again? Despite the short-term market weakness, like if we look at free cash flow that we can generate, it remain to be very strong. So we plan to further increase dividend in 2019. We will get a board approval in February, so we will make announcement after that. All right. Next question will be coming from JPMorgan's Gokul. My first question, could you talk a little bit about any recalibration in the China expansion given what we have seen with cryptocurrency and some the China demand as well? Could you talk about the plans on China expansion? I think last time, you mentioned maybe go up to 20k in Phase 1 and then potentially expand beyond that. Is there any timeline difference on the Nanjing fab? The plan did not change because this is a short-term kind of market softenings. No, it did not change our strategy. The plan continues. Is there any timing differential in terms of when you get into Phase 2 given the... It will depend on the business situation, definitely. But 20,000 wafer per month is the plan, continue to be executed. Okay. Next question I had was on N5, so just building on some of the other questions as well. So it is -- for many customers, it's going to be the first node with significant EUV insertion. So could you help us understand what is the feedback you're getting from customers? Are customers planning to stay on at N7 longer, given N7 has been a successfully proven node and as you mentioned a lot more customers are coming through there? Or do we expect to see the same number of tapeouts, like 50 tapeouts that you had by end of 2017? Are we going to be at similar kind of levels as we get into end of this year? Can you give us some idea about how that progress from our breadth of customer base is progressing in N5? Okay. On the N5 progress, I just reported that our progress is on track and we work with our customers. And you say that whether our customer are worried or have concern on EUV's readiness or the stability or those kind of things, no, they are happy with us. We worked with supplier, we worked with the customer on both side and our progress is so far, so good. Now whether that they want to move into N5 or stay in the 7, all I say is all the customer who are working with us on N7 are engaging with us at N5. The product, when they want to introduce into the market, that to our customer's judgment. Because N5 did offer very good performance per se as compared with N7. So some of the high-speed computing, some of the high-end smartphone, they still need to go into N5. So you would expect those customer will adopt the N5 immediately that when it is available, okay. So number of the tapeouts, I cannot tell you right now. But I already told you that all the customers are engaging with us. Next question will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. I wanted to ask a follow-up on your guidance for 2019. Last year, you gave a guidance at the beginning of the year for first half year-over-year growth and also second half year-over-year. So if you could give a view or maybe split how you see first half versus second half? So Lora, can you give the number? Second half definitely is better than first half, okay? That's good, much better. First quarter of '19 is quite weak, and we think it's going to take another quarter to recover. So from what I have seen now for this year, if you compare year-over-year, our first half may not be higher, maybe worse than last year, okay? But second half definitely will be better. Okay. A follow-up on the application and inventory issue, could you talk how broad? Because you did flag smartphone as inventory, but could you flag how broad you think that inventory issue is? Is it across applications? And the guidance by product had Industrial up significantly, Consumer up slightly. If you could talk a bit about that factoring in the inventory comments, what's driving those increases? You mean supply chains inventory? Yes, just -- because you mentioned it's a broad inventory or you have an inventory issue, how you see it across the other applications and then what's driving the segments... Exiting 2018, I think the inventory increase is broad range, yes, because of the macroeconomic and uncertainty on this trade tension, pretty much put people really on a whole very careful. So it seems to be across the board. Okay. And then, I guess, the rationale then for Industrial up significantly and Consumer up slightly. Well, I think the Industrial... Randy, your question is Industrial segment is down in first quarter? No, I think you said Industrial was up significantly and Consumer up slightly in the first quarter. Oh, no, no. I said Industrial down significantly, yes. Only Consumer up slightly. The other sector are all down, okay? Okay, okay. And if I could squeeze one more. In the back end, it's still another significant CapEx. Could you talk, maybe a snapshot, what you expect for the back-end business this year and what you're seeing for InFO and CoWoS expansion this year? The back-end business is, this year, it will grow double digit. Still a very good business because we offer the solution to the customer, so that they can get a higher performance and a better cost structure that they can offer in the other place. The back-end last year is about TWD 2.5 billion. And going forward, currently, we see the double-digit growth at least year-over-year. To clarify, back-end business still is initial stage because, as you remember initially, our back-end was adopted by the smartphone. But now more and more, we see the high-performance computing customer in the 5-nanometer. Almost all of them adopt -- wants to adopt the what we call advanced packaging. So we see the advanced packaging business is coming to support our high-performance computing products across the leading-edge customers. Just to make the record, from now on, we call -- we don't call it back-end, we call it advanced packaging because we realize that packaging is very different than the back-end or the business we use to know. Follow-up question from CL Securities, Sebastian Hou. First follow-up is can you provide us some update on the tapeout numbers that you have received on 5-nanometers now or your expectation by the end of this year? Well, I just said that I cannot give you the numbers today. But I repeat it again, all the 7-nanometer customers are working with us right now on their design. Okay. And the 7-nanometer tapeout number is still on track to exceed 100 by the end of this year? It's still. Or it could be earlier? Well, it will depend on the -- how quickly that our customer can adopt our N7, N7+. But still, the numbers still meet our expectation; on the HPC, probably even more higher, yes. And given the current macro uncertainty, have you noticed any of your customers, which are doing the tapeout on 7 right now, become more hesitant or cautious in terms of the production schedule? No, they are being very aggressive because of 7-nanometer is very good performance, so that can help them to gain the market to their product going to the market. So it's not slowing down, it's actually accelerating a little bit. Okay. So I think last year and this year, I think probably only not a big portion of these 7-nanometer tapeout customers are reaching -- already reached production, is that a fair assumption? Yes. Just one of the big customers account for big wafer volume, but the tapeout number is small. And -- which means that do you expect more of this smaller volume type of customers, but they together account for the big numbers of the tapeout, will reach production in 2020? Well, I just mentioned yes, some of the second wave or third wave of product design get into the 7, 7+ will start to ramp probably second half or the fourth quarter of this year. Mass production will be expected in 2020. Okay. So it sounds like you don't notice or feel any bubbling in terms of the tapeout booming. No, we did not see that. Okay, it's great. My next question is -- sorry, I only have one question. Okay. All right, follow-up questions from Citi's Roland Shu. Last year, the raw wafer negative impact our gross margin. How about this year? Are we going to still see the same trend? Or we're going to see either will be reversed maybe or benefit for this raw wafer price in our margin? We have signed a long-term contract with our suppliers in 2017 and '18, so lock in the long-term supply and also lock in the price. So we do not see any further price deterioration for us, yes. Okay. Yes, but given now that demand is declining and that -- are we going to renegotiate these longer contracts with these wafer suppliers? Yes. So this is the follow-up, 2019 and 2020, this will fill up going forward? Going forward. Going forward. Going forward, we hope we achieve some cost saving. Okay. Second question is that by when you will see your CPU revenue to reach 1% of your total revenue, and also, by when you will see the CPU function outsourcing coming from multiple customers? As so very specific of what percent, but they say that we start to working with the CPU customers and starting from 7, 7+ and all the way to 5, okay? And when time's up, report it here to say what is percentage that we got from the CPU, okay. I think you can calculate from our customers that are finished or... Okay. I think just to clarify, C.C., you've said that you start to work with a CPU customer or customers. Customers. All right. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. A couple of questions on the trade tension and tariffs. One is that with tariffs becoming, I guess, more prevalent, does that change your outlook on where to place the fabs? And secondly, you've got more competition at the trading edge if you look at the Chinese fabs. Are you seeing an opportunity to take share with the trade tension? Okay. You talked about fab location, right, it is -- as you know, we have -- when we build fab, we -- nowadays we only build the leading-edge fabs, that is we build -- we are doing 5-nanometer fabs preparation and we're building 3-nanometer. And the decision was made to building Tainan, okay, and of course, with across-the-board support from the local and administration here. Upon the trade tension, I think they appears that we will -- at this point, it seems that they have nudged that, ""Hey, is it good to build a fab in Taiwan?"" But actually, we have almost none request from our customer to change the plan we have. We -- but however, we do constantly assessing and deliberation about what's the pro and the cons of that plan and whether there are other options. But so far, we haven't changed our plan. The prime reason is this. When we ramp the leading-edge fabs, as you know, those are the, really, for the high-performance computing or smartphone launch, the ramp is very tight. Time-to-market is critical. And to have a leading-edge fab ramp, not only this fab has to be closely coupled with an R&D fab, which is in Hsinchu, the 2 teams almost work as 1 team, also this fab has to collaborate with other fabs in TSMC. As our founder mentioned, there are thousands of engineer transported from fab to fab to cope with the sudden ramp of those resources needed. So those are the background of those leading-edge fab. When we open book with our customers, this is the best sure way to ensure their product announcement and product launch, and the request conversation will take them back. But we're constantly watching this bigger geopolitical change, of course, but at this present time, we do not have plan to change that. The second part of the question is are you seeing an opportunity to take share, for example, if U.S. customers don't want to use Chinese fabs? The question is -- say it again? Is there an opportunity at the trailing edge 28-nanometers, 8-inch, to take market share? Oh, Chinese fab? If U.S. customers don't want to use the Chinese fabs? Well, most of the U.S. customer -- currently, the Chinese fab is still not used by the local customers, let me put it this way. Intention of the other U.S. customer, we didn't encounter those comments, yes. All right. Follow-up questions coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. Yes. So I want to follow up a little bit about the trade tension issue because another topic is about Huawei's 5G and information security issue, right? So how does the company kind of evaluate this kind of business risk, I mean, in exposure to Huawei's supply chain? And have you got any concern from governments or U.S. government on this topic? No. And we are everybody's foundry, and we did not see any kind of instruction or information from the government, so business as usual. Okay. Okay. And also, another question is regarding your specialty semiconductor strategy. As you mentioned, you want to build up a new 8-inch fab in Tainan, I would guess it's for lots of niche demand. But how do you deal with this kind of outsourcing or partnership with your subsidiary, Vanguard, going forward in the 8-inch business? Well, if you look at the market, 8-inch is a business actually sometimes the capacity is seeing a shortage. But regardless of Vanguard or not, TSMC did not increase the capacity. We increased the specialty's capability and also that our service to the customer. So we built the new building to give more room to put the specialty tool inside to support our customer. Okay, okay. And that's the -- I guess, this year could be tough, right, it could be the first downturn that 2 gentlemen become the new management, right? So is there any initiative that you want to take the company get through this potential downturn, any new initiatives in the company? Why do you say this is a new management? We have been here for more than 20 years at least. The new manager -- I mean, that's -- we follow a very good guidance from the previous chairman. And so far, so good. The strategy continues, the management style continues. So new management, hard to say. Sorry about the phrasing, sorry. Let me comment on this. This is -- we, over the years -- I mean, right now probably is the -- in terms of technology portfolio, TSMC has built both leading edge and specialty. I think this is the strongest position at present time. You agree? And also about the customer engagement or customer portfolio, this time is about the widest customer portfolio we ever have. And C.C. is talking about getting into high-performance computings even to CPUs, including data center CPU, accelerators and the client CPUs. It's probably the widest addressable market we ever have. So we're going to continue this 3 thrusts. We're going to invest further on the R&D and we're going to continue to engage with our customers' design, closely build it as a team. Actually, we sent people to our customers to build the design of 5-nanometer, some of them on 3-nanometer discussion. And also, we just want the high-performance computing can adopt our technology development features more tightly. So we think this is a -- although we're facing some headwinds on the macro economy and just on the -- another uncertainty is, not in our control, is the trade dispute tension. We just hope the 2 country can come to a win-win or at least not lose-lose solution. I think we are on the road to the -- to climb our next peak, yes. With TSMC's business under the steady stable hands and the expanding addressable market, we will conclude today's conference.

So please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC’s CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance of the second quarter. First quarter revenue decreased 24.5% quarter-over-quarter as our business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand, also customers' inventory corrections and high-end smartphone seasonality and the photoresist defect material incident.
Due to lower level of capacity utilization and the negative impact from a photoresist defect material incident, gross margin decreased 6.4 percentage points sequentially to 41.3%. Total operating expenses decreased by about TWD 4.8 billion and they represented 11.9% of total net revenue in the first quarter. So operating margin decreased by 7.6 percentage points sequentially to 29.4%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was $2.37 and ROE for the first quarter was 14.4%.
Now let’s take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer technology accounted for 22% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, 10-nanometer was 4% and 16-nanometer was 16%. Advanced technologies, which we now define as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 42% of wafer revenue.
Now let’s take a look at revenue contribution by application. During the first quarter, Communication, Computer, Consumer and Industrial/Standard decreased 27%, 31%, 10% and 16%, respectively. Now this is the last time we provide a revenue breakdown by application. From this quarter on, we will report revenue breakdown by platform as we believe this change will better represent the company’s results.
Now let me explain how to read the table. The table shows the – between the four application and six platforms how do they relate to each other. In general, within computer application, almost all revenue is from HPC. Within Communication, about 2/3 is from smartphone. HPC is about 1/5, and other platforms are single digit each. Consumer is mainly distributed between HPC and the digital consumer electronics whereas Industrial/Standard spread across all platforms, with smartphone and HPC each representing above 30%.
Now let’s take a look at revenue contribution by platform for the first quarter. Smartphone decreased 33% to accounted for 47% of our first quarter revenue. HPC decreased 26% to accounted for 29%, while IoT, automotive, digital, consumer electronics and others accounted for 5% to 7% each.
Now I would like to move on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 760 billion, an increase of TWD 65 billion from the last quarter. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 38 billion. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased eight days to 49 days, a sales decrease faster than average accounts receivable. Days of inventory increased 12 days to 79 days, reflecting 7-nanometer wafer prebuild and an increase in raw wafers.
Now let me take a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 153 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 76 billion in capital expenditures. As a result, we generated free cash flow of $77 billion and our overall cash balance increased $88 billion to reach $646 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditure was $2.46 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let me provide the second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect second quarter revenue to be between USD 7.55 billion and USD 7.65 billion, which is a 7.1% sequential increase at mid point. Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.85, our first quarter gross margin is expected to be between 43% and 45%. Our first quarter operating margin is expected to be between 31% and 33%.
Also, in the second quarter, we will again need to accrue the 10% retained – 10% tax on undisputed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be about 18%. The tax rate will then fall back to 10% level in the third and fourth quarter and the full year tax rate will be about 12%. This concludes my remark. Let me follow by making a few comments about the profitability, CapEx and cash dividend.
First, let me talk about the profitability in the first and second quarter. Our first quarter gross margin declined by 6.4 percentage points sequentially as our 7-nanometer saw a substantial cutback in utilization in first quarter due to high-end smartphone seasonality, which impacted our gross margin by close to 4 percentage points. In addition, the photo material – photoresist material incident impact our gross margin by about 2.6 percentage points as we indicated in our press release in February.
I have just guided the second quarter gross margin to improve by 2.7 percentage points sequentially at the midpoint. Since most of the wafer scrapped in first quarter due to the photoresist incident will be made up in second quarter, gross margin can improve by about 1.5 percentage point in this quarter. In addition, the 7-nanometer dilution in second quarter, as compared to fourth quarter 2018, will be close to 3 percentage point, which is about 1 percentage points improvement from the first quarter in terms of dilution. And we also expect a slight improvement in other nodes' utilization rate.
Our gross margin in first and second quarter are primarily impacted by a lower capacity utilization rate. As our business and utilization rate improves in the second half of this year, we believe about 50% is still a target for our gross margin going forward.
Now I will talk about the CapEx outlook. We reiterate our 2019 CapEx to be between USD 10 billion to USD 11 billion. About 80% of the CapEx budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies. As I have stated before, we see our CapEx forecast between USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion to support our average growth rate of 5% to 10% per annum in the next few years.
My last comment is about the cash dividend distribution. In the future, TSMC intend to return about 70% of free cash flow to shareholder every year by distributing quarterly dividends. TSMC also remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
In June, TSMC will hold the annual shareholder meeting to approve the Board’s proposed TWD 8 cash dividend per share for the full year of 2018. And the shareholder meeting will also approve the revision of the articles of incorporation to adopt quarterly dividends. Subject to the approval by the annual shareholder meeting, the Board plans to approve TWD 2 cash dividend per share for the first quarter 2019 and to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2019. Therefore, TSMC’s shareholder will receive a total of TWD 10 per share cash dividend in 2019. That also means, in 2020, shareholders will receive at least TWD 10 per share cash dividend for the whole year.
That concludes my remark. Let me turn the podium to C.C. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 280.7 billion or USD 7.1 billion, in line with our revised guidance. Our business in the first quarter was impacted by three factors: first, the overall global economic condition, which dampened the end market demand; second, customers are ongoing inventory adjustment; and third, the high-end mobile product seasonality. Meanwhile, the net effect from the photoresist defect material incident also impact our first quarter revenue by about 3.5%.
Moving into second quarter this year. While the economical factor and mobile product seasonality still linger, we believe we may have passed the pattern of the cycle of our business as we are seeing customers' demand stabilizing. Based upon customer indications for their business and wafer loading in second quarter, we also expect our customers' overall inventory to be substantially reduced and approach the seasonal level around the middle of this year.
In the second half of this year, TSMC’s business will be supported by this year’s inventory base as well as strong demand from our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology, which support high-end smartphone new product launches, initial 5G deployment and HPC-related applications. For the whole year of 2019, we forecast the overall semiconductor market is good in memory as well as foundry growth to both be flattish. For TSMC, we reiterate that we expect to grow slightly in 2019.
Now let me update the photoresist material incident. On February 15, in order to ensure quality of wafer delivery, TSMC announced it will scrap a large number of wafers as a result of a batch of bad photoresist material from a chemical supplier. This batch of photoresist contain a foreign polymer that created a desirable – undesirable effect and resulted in yield deviation on 12-and 16-nanometer wafers at Fab 14B.
We have since taken corrective action to enhance our defenses and minimize future risk. Our actions including the following: improved TSMC’s own in-house incoming material, conforming test and controls; upgrade control and methodology with all suppliers for incoming material quality certification; establish robust in-line and off-line monitoring process to prevent defect escape.
Now I will talk about our N5 status. Our N5 technology development is well on track. N5 has entered risk production in first quarter, and we expect customer tape-outs starting this quarter and volume production ramp in first half of 2020. With 1.8 times logic density and 15% speed gain and an ARM A72 core compared with 7-nanometer, we believe our N5 technology is the most competitive in the industry. With the best density performance, power and the best transistor technology, we expect most of our customers who are using 7-nanometer today will adopt 5-nanometer. With N5, we are expanding our customer product portfolio and increasing our addressable market. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will also be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I’ll talk about the ramp up of N7 and N7+ and introduction of N6. We are seeing strong tape-out activity at N7, which include HPC, IoT and automotive. Meanwhile, our N7+, which adopts EUV for few critical areas, has already started volume production now. The yield rate is comparable to N7. We’ll reaffirm N7 and N7+ will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in year 2019.
As we continue to improve our 7-nanometer technology and by leveraging the EUV landing form, N7+, we now introduce N6 process. N6 has three major advantage. First, N6 have 100% compatible design rules with N7, which allows customer to directly migrate from N7-based design, which substantially shorten the time-to-market. Second, N6 can deliver 18% higher logical density as compared to N7 and provide customer with a highly competitive performance-to-cost advantage. Third, N6 will offer shortened cycle time and better defect density. Risk production of N6 is scheduled to begin in first quarter year 2020 with volume production starting before the end of 2020.
Now let me talk about our advanced packaging technology. TSMC’s advanced packaging strategy focuses on providing advanced wafer level system integration technologies to meet customers' product needs. Currently, we have offered InFO and CoWoS for several generation and recently introduced SoIC. We believe heterogenous integration and package endeavor has become a clear trend for many applications. All our advanced packaging platforms and our efficient system level integration, and will continue to do so.
Our fourth generation InFO solutions provide a final interconnected line with anticipation to enable both mobile and HPC products. CoWoS continue to see good growth momentum in demand from HPC and the AI applications as we continue to expand beyond the radical size. We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which is an industry-leading 3D-IC packaging solution. We target to start production in 2021 time frame.
The traction of our advanced packaging solution has been strong in mobile and HPC segment and we have seen inquiry form automotive segment as well. We therefore believe our advanced packaging solutions will contribute to our business growth for years to come.
Finally, I will talk about the HPC as our most important growth driver in the next five years. CPU, AI accelerator and networking will be the main growth area for our HPC platform. With the successful ramp of N7, N7+ and the upcoming N6 and N5, we are able to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market to support applications, such as data center, PC and tablets. Meanwhile, we also see networking querying thanks to 5G infrastructure deployment over the next few years. We are truly excited about our growth opportunities in HPC.
Thank you for your attention. All right. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] First question will be coming from Citigroup’s Roland Shu. First question. As C.C. said, you maintain your view for the whole year revenue to grow slightly. So that means according to your first quarter revenue, second quarter guidance means that second half is going to grow very fast. So can you just let us know what kind of applications are driving so strong second half to TSMC this year? The strong demand I just mentioned from 7-nanometer actually including the mobile platform, HPC platform and IoT, which is a little bit flattish over automotive, but that’s all that what we rely on. Actually, we will say that seasonality of the mobile phone, the new product launch that make the major contribution. Yes. And I just through this calculation. I think for second half, your revenue actually is going to grow year by year in, maybe, mid-single digit year-on-year. So I think, except for this seasonality, do you gain share or do you have more new applications in second half? We actually gained some shares because of 7-nanometer. And for the new product portfolio, that will be probably you will see the effect in 2020, not much in this year. Okay. Yes, and also for the second half gross margin, lower sales with this higher utilization and also with the less dilution from 7-nanometer. So is that your long-term gross margin will be – target will be 50%. So is this means that for second half or just for the long term? Both. Okay. My second question is, C.C., last quarter, you said that now we are at the market with the widest addressable market driven by HPC and CPU. And C.C. also said that HPC is going to be our most important growth driver. So can you quantify how big foundry addressable market will be driven by HPC and CPU, respectively? I don’t think I have enough data to tell you that how much we can quantify the percentage. But I believe the HPC platform will grow double digit excluding the cryptocurrency, of course. How about the CPU? Too specific. Okay. And I think, lastly. Roland, you have more than two. This is a follow-up for the second question. Yes. So do you have any competition on this CPU foundry also? Again, I don’t want to be too more specific on the CPU area, all right, Roland? Next. The question will be coming from JPMorgan’s Gokul. So my first question is on 5-nanometer. I think in the last conference call, C.C., you mentioned that TSMC will be initially building a few percentage points or some lower capacity on 5-nanometer in 2020 compared to 7-nanometer. Now that you have more visibility into your customers' plans, could you let us know what does that mean? Is that 30% lower, 10% lower? What does it mean? And why is that? Is it because customer is a little bit hesitant to go to 5-nanometer and has other options? Or you just believe that, like you previously mentioned, the only reason is that high-end smartphone demand expectation, you’re taking a more cautious view on that? That’s my first question. Actually, Gokul, I like your last sentence, you say that’s more cautiously. Let me repeat again that we say N5’s the initial ramp, it might be slower than the N7. First, we learned a lesson from the N7’s wafer loading. Look at this year, so first quarter and second quarter right now, it’s actually very low so we learned a lesson.
So we are working with the customer to be more cautiously and effectively manage the capacity ramping, so that’s what I said that it will be a little bit slow. But that being said, the N5’s business, I want to reassure everybody that N5 as a business will grow bigger than N7 because our expanding the product portfolio, and you know what I mean. In the HPC, we have very good opportunities and on the smartphone we are gaining market share. So I will believe that N5 initial ramp probably a little bit more cautiously slower than the N7, but it will pick up quickly. Okay. Got it. My second question is on the technology leadership. I think TSMC clearly now seems to be ahead of even IDMs in terms of technology leadership. How should we think about how that translates in a financial basis? What we’ve seen in semiconductor industry in the last several years is when one player becomes the dominant player, typically, margins go up. How should we think about this?
What is TSMC’s philosophy in terms of utilizing this technology leadership? Are we looking for higher than market revenue growth or we should expect structurally higher margins in the future years now that we are kind of getting through the smartphone saturation period and getting into HPC? As you pointed out, we have technology leadership and supposed – and we are working on it also. Actually, we want to grow the market share. We want to do a bigger business with a higher product profitability. I don’t have enough data in my hand to give you order analysis in the future years, but we are working on it. And that the goal we are working on, actually, higher profitability and gain market share. So just one sub question there. I think if we observe the last couple of years, TSMC – foundry industry has not outgrown semis, ex memory. And TSMC also has not grown much faster than the foundry industry, which was not the case in the past. In the past foundry was growing much faster than semis, and TSMC was growing much faster than semis – foundries. So when do we expect that gap to open up between TSMC’s growth and foundry growth and potentially foundry growth and semis growth itself? You are asking more and more specific on the schedule. I would – I would expect that starting from the second half of this year and extended to the next few years, we will start to widen the gap. Did that answer your question? That’s specific enough. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. So in the last couple of months, I’ve had a chance to visit a few fabless customers and I feel like the feedback that I’m getting is that, maybe previously, there was more concerns about EUV feasibility. That is now mostly going away or maybe it’s less. But on the flip side, I hear maybe a bit more concerns about cost per transistor for 5-nanometers. I’m wondering if you agree with that and what can be done about that. Well, that’s a good question. We did some calculation by ourselves. We still think that cost per transistor is still decreasing, but not as fast as it used to be. That’s one thing. As you mentioned about the EUV, today, we put the EUV into mass production already, and we learned some kind of experience so that we can introduce N6. But is EUV productivity is very good already?
Not yet. We expect it to continue to improve every year, just as we did for the emerging photolithography. So we expect in the future that EUV will offer a best tool in terms of cost, in terms of technologies moving forward, but not today yet. There’s still a lot of process complexity, so we’re using the EUV to replace some of the very critical areas and the cost will probably are equal today. And in the future, we hope it will improve. Once it improve, the cost per transistor will decrease faster. Is there a timing for that? No. But as fast as possible. Sorry. Second question is just a clarification. I think, previously, Dr. Wei said that HPC ex crypto grows double digits. Is that for this year or is that longer term? For this year, it’s closed. For longer term, that’s what I mean, for longer term. Yes. Really appreciate the breakout by platform. Can you help me with this year’s growth, maybe just for smartphone versus HPC? Both are probably in the middle-single digit, somewhere around that. Okay. So HPC is close to that … Yes. Without crypto, mid-single digit including crypto? No. HPC without the cryptocurrency, it will be somewhere mid-single digit. With the cryptocurrency, it’s dragged down. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley’s Charlie Chan. First of all, just want to follow up that HPC segment because just compare the notes, last quarter, we said HPC excluding crypto upsizing right? Including crypto, down more than 10%. So it seems like the number seems to be a little bit better. Is that the right comment about HPC market doing better than expected? Yes. It’s doing better because of one of the factor or one of the component in HPC is networking. And you know that 5G’s deployment, so that helped the growth of the networking quickly. Okay. Yes, so I think this is related to my second question, right? I think a lot of shareholders are saying that some big customers in smartphone and the base station segment is building up inventory for whatever reason, share gain or semiconductor strategic inventory.
But you mentioned – you also said that you believe the inventory level will be back to normal around the midyear. So my question is do you worry about this kind of overview of inventory and how are you going to manage that kind of risk? We don’t specifically comment on one customer’s particular business behavior, but then we share with you why we say that the inventory will be greatly reduced and be close to the seasonal level around the middle of this year. We actually will look at our history in the second quarter, the customer’s growth rate, and we’re using that number and look at the customer’s demand number to give to us in the second quarter. And we do some calculation and we come to a conclusion that they are digesting their inventory quickly. So that’s how we say that’s in the second quarter, we are not building the inventory. They are actually – they are reducing the inventory quickly. And that’s why we come to the conclusion that in the second half, we will [indiscernible] inventory base. Okay. Yes, maybe a quick question to Lora on cash dividend. So you – so this year, I think the quarterly run rate is like $2 per quarter, right, but the annual dividend payout is actually $10 in total, right. So for next year, what will be the kind of minimum dividend payout to use $2 run rate so we get like $8 for full year for 2020, you said the guidance. This year, actually, is a transition year, so we issue twice of cash dividend. First, $8, followed by the $2 on quarterly basis. Starting from first quarter next year, we will only have a quarterly dividend, and we want to have a sustainable on quarterly dividend and on annual both. So we will likely see more stable dividend on quarterly basis as well. So since I said, the dividend will be no less than $10, and we want to be stable on quarterly basis. So you can assume or expect we will issue $2.50 on quarterly basis at least. All right. Next question will be coming from Credit Suisse, Randy Abrams. I want to ask a follow-up. It was a good disclosure moving to the new platform segmentation. Could you talk about sequential pickup? How you see the different four platforms? How they’re sequentially improving from this low level. And then for full year, since we’ve got the first pieces also the IoT and automotive, what your views on the other segments for the full year? I will first comment on the second quarter on a sequential basis by platform and followed by the full year picture. Is that what you’re asking, Randy? Okay. For second quarter, we are expecting smartphone to grow single digit. HPC grow double digit, and IoT, automotive and others will grow single-digit, and the digital consumer electronic will slightly decline. okay. That’s for second quarter. For the whole year, we expect smartphone will grow high-single digit. HPC excluding crypto will grow high-single digit as well. And IoT will grow double digit, automotive will decline single digit, and digital still cameras and others will decline single digit. That’s the overall picture for this year. Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And then follow-up on the migration for these derivatives, 7-plus and six nanometer. It seems to date, the adoption has been rather slow for this year. If you could talk maybe about factors why a lot of customers are staying on seven for now. And as the node matures, if you could talk about the pace? How you see customer see a percent of the node or how meaningful next one or two years for those derivative process? As I said, we have a very high tape-out activity for N7 for this year. Actually, a lot of customer from the [indiscernible], and mostly is from the HPC area, they are all designing their product with N7. A few of them has adopted N7+. But then that’s why we introduced our N6 that can be 100% compatible to the N7. So I’ll give you a taste of that probably starting year 2020. Most of the customer in the N7 will move to N6. And from that beyond probably, the N6 will pick up all the momentum and pick up all the volume production. Okay. Great. If I can ask a follow-up to, given the strength on these derivatives, 6-nanometer, 5 and optimism, do you have any different view on 28 about – if any of this equipment could be migrated to these advanced nodes? Or do you think it will be all new capacity? From node to node, we have about 90% of the common tool or bigger than 90% of the percentage of the common tool being used for the next node. So you bet that some of the tools from 28-nanometer can be used for 7 or for 5, okay? But of course, it’s less and less. But to – for the overcapacity in the 28-nanometer because of some of the market-driven capacity increase, we – our strategy is to develop some of derivative technology like a 22-nanometer and so that we can ensure that we still have standard growth in the future. Next question will be coming from Daiwa’s Rick Hsu. [Foreign Language] This is Rick from Daiwa. So I think the first question is about the follow-up on the N6. My question is would you worry whether the N6 will cannibalize N5 development because this node looks pretty close. The number N6 and N5 looks pretty close, but actually the performance are – they still have a big gap. N5 compared with N7, actually, the logic density increased by 80%, 8-0. N6 compared with N7 is only 18. So you can see there’s a big difference in that logic density and transistor performance also. And so as a result, the total power consumption in the chip is lower in the N5. And also that – there’s a lot of benefit if you move into N5. But nevertheless, N5 is one of the node, full node, and it takes time for the customer to design their new product. The beauty of the N6 is they’re already designing N7. They spend a way minimal effort. They can move into the N6 and gain some benefit. And so some of the customer that depend on their product as characteristic [ph] and their market, they are defined which one go to N6, which one go to N5. Can I have one quick follow-up to the first question before I ask the second one? Just a quick follow-up. Can you share the number of critical layer that will be built by EUV for – I know for 7+, you – I think last year, you mentioned just few layers, critical layer for EUV. What about N6 and N5? Okay. N6 has few critical layer plus 1. Okay. That gives you a hint. N5 has plus many, so... Okay. That’s very clear. And my second question is you look at your end first quarter inventory days, 79. If I don’t remember wrong, I think this is probably kind of an all-time high in the history. Majority of this inventory were finished wafers or can you share some idea – and also, can you elaborate a little bit more what’s the rationale behind that 79 days? Yes. Okay. Rick, 79 is really high, but there’s a good reason for that. Because we anticipated 7-nanometer capacity will be very tight in the second half. Well, it’s not so tight. It’s very empty in the first half. So we’re trying to preview some of the inventory for our customer in work in process. So they will not be constrained by our second half capacity. So by doing so, that work in in process value will certainly go up, right? So when we move in the second half, when we digest those inventory and demand start to pick up, our days of inventory will come down in the second half. Next question will be coming from Bruce Lu, who is now with Goldman Sachs. My first question is still going back to the smartphone. Management mentioned that the smartphone growth is going to be high single digit. This is substantially stronger than the smartphone shipment growth. And management also guided previously that the next couple of years, smartphone growth will be mid-single digit. Again, it’s also higher than the smartphone shipment growth in our view. So where is the growth coming from? Is it mainly driven by the content growth or share gain either by your customer or yourselves share gain? And can we somehow quantify that a little bit? Quantify, I probably cannot. But the answer to your question is both. We gain the market share and the content increase quite a lot. Can we know like which one is stronger? You got me. I want both of them to be as high as possible, but I don’t have a calculation. Because of the market share gain, we have to be very careful into doing the calculation. And also the content increase. Let me say that content increase in the 5G area or in the AI area, every customer are different. So they put a different functionality inside. And we don’t have a very good detail or detail inside to give you exactly a number to quantify what is the percentage per se. I see. The reason I tried to dig down a bit further is that if the content growth which means that, that will be at expense of the smartphone cost structure. So you have higher content growth, which means that semi content in terms of cost structure is higher, which at the end of the day will dampen the smartphone shipment as price elastic. So how do you – we’ve foreseen very, very strong content growth, which means that the cost structure for your customer will be much higher at the end of the day. So there will be certain trade-off at the end of the day. There will be certain trade-off of the high-end smartphones pricing and their cost, of course. But for TSMC, our job is to fully support customers' need. When they need this functionality, they need this kind of speed, we support it. Whether that will increase their pricing or the smartphones end market strategy, that’s not really our concern. We support it all the way. Okay. My second question is more for Lora. So can you somehow help us to quantify the margin impact in 2020 as we can expect like very high – very quick ramp-up for the 5-nanometer, which naturally, in the first year, there will be the negative margin impact. And we will come into the third year of 7-nanometer, so the margin negative impact should be less, but you have new margin negative 0.5. So how do we – can we get some color on it? The margin impact actually has two front. Number one, introduction of new technology as you just mentioned. Usually, in the first year, there’s a dilution to corporate gross margin. The other factor is utilization on each technology node, particularly the advanced technology node is more sensitive to utilization. So if we look at the corporate margin, we have to take consideration of both. But if we just talk about the leading-edge introductions, N5 will be like N7. It will have some dilution next year. And so we have indicated before, it takes seven or eight quarters to reach to corporate level. We believe N5 will follow the same pattern. But can we assume that the first two quarters of N5 in the second half next year when you ramp-up the negative impact for the margin is likely 2% or 3% like what we had in 7? No. We need to look at what’s the ramping speed as well. Because if you ramp faster, eventually, you can get through the learning curve quicker. So if you ramp slower, you’ll take long time. So it’s – many factors will affect that. I see. Because most of the investor concern is that with EUV potential higher CapEx, blah, blah, blah, so that might have higher negative impact in terms of gross margin when we ramp up five. So we just want to get some color to clear the concern. I think the N5 impact will not have difference than our previous leading nodes. I think this is about time that we should go to the line for the questions. Operator, could you please have the next caller on the line? Sure. Next question is from the line of Brett Simpson of Arete Research. I have plenty of questions for C.C. First on FD-SOI. It seems to be getting more traction in 5G than we first thought both on the – On RF-SOI and on the modem side for handsets. So I’m just keen to understand if TSMC might consider supporting FD-SOI or RF-SOI. And if not, how you plan to defend against it? Okay. The question is FD-SOI has some good momentum in 5G area. And does TSMC consider to develop the FD-SOI? The answer is no. Actually, we also offer very good technology, 22 nanometers technology that today’s performance is very comparable to FD-SOI, if not better. And we’re talking to the customer right now and a lot of customers start to adopt the TSMC’s approach. So no, we are not going to develop FD-SOI technology. Okay. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up, C.C. Can you give us your perspective on TSMC’s strategy for quantum semiconductor materials like gallium nitride or silicon carbide? It seems to be still very small market, but the potential long term seems to be quite significant. So how does TSMC plan to deploy these in its variance? Thank you. Okay. The question is about [indiscernible] compound or that compound semiconductors. TSMC actually is developing the gallium nitride technology to support the power management IC or the high-voltage, high-current power management. And others like gallium arsenide to have a high frequency or those kind of thing, no, we are not doing it. We – actually, we are doing the gallium nitride project to support our customers' need. That, today, we are doing. Silicon carbide, no. We are not doing it also. Okay, thanks very much. Operator, can you have the caller on – the next caller on the line, please? Sure. We have Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First one, is your guide on the smartphone revenue growth of high single digit this year impacted by one of the leading semiconductor company exiting the baseband business. And I’m just trying to better understand how you view going to capital as an opportunity, and I have a follow-up. Mehdi’s question is that whether or not this year are a high single-digit growth in the smartphone platform is affected by one very large company’s exit from the baseband market. Well, again, we don’t comment on specific customer’s business situation, but I will say this year that we have a high single-digit smartphones, of course. It’s that because of, one, we gained market share. Two, again, that silicon content is higher. So that’s why we say we have high single-digit growth. Okay. Great. And then turning onto the 6-nanometer. I’m just trying to better understand the applications that would utilize 6-nanometer. And if I heard you correctly, six is going to be ramping later than five. And if you could elaborate on the current applications that would use that would be good at understanding that particular node? Right. The question is about N6. It looks like N6 is behind N5 in terms of schedule. So what is the application? Well, again, I want to reiterate that N6 is coming from the N7, N7+ experience, learning. And so the N6, if you – a lot of customers are already entering N7 with a lot of tapeout. So N6 provide them a very good task that they can easily put in their current product into N6. So gain the benefit of either the performance, the tie area and also the shortened cycle time. N5 is a totally new node.
So we’re entering into a very new area. If you start to design the N5 today as compared with you want to enter the N6 with N7 already in your pocket, I think N6 will be much easier. I cannot say that N5 might be part of that but TSMC will help you to move into N5, of course. But you look at the effort that you view the ecosystem. Ecosystem is the one that’s very important for all the product company want to design their new product. N7’s ecosystem has been very complete. We even offer to the automotive grid, okay?
And not to mention about mobile HPC, everything. The ecosystem are ready and equally mature with N6. Because we’re 100% compatible. Of course, you still have to do some modification. If you want to shrink your tie, you have to rerun your timing, closure, those kind of things. But still much easier from N7 go to N6 rather than N7 go to N5. And that’s the beauty of these two technology. Did I answer the question? Yes. Thank you. Follow-up question from Citi’s Roland. Thank you, thanks for taking my question again. So it looks like 2020 will be a very busy year to you. You are ramping up N7 plus, N6 and N5 together in the same year. So what kind of revenue growth projection underlying these three key technology ramp next year? Roland, we don’t forecast next year. And please attend the first quarter next year. Okay. Then you have so many new technology ramp up next year. So how about 2021? So any new technology? What kind of new technology you are going to launch in 2021? Please attend next year’s... Thank you. My next question is for Lora. So I looked at your 20-F. I think now your total accumulated legal capital reserves have exceeded paid-in capital in 2018. But still, both direct mid-teen in February have been approved to continue appropriating 10% of 2018 income to legal reserve. So why don’t you just pay this 10% to investors in order to improve your ROE? We are increasing the dividend, and it’s all come from returning including the capital surplus, which we accrue every year. So we can choose not to, but we choose to because we want to be more conservative. And if we needed, we can issue dividend from that accrue as well. So no impact to shareholders. Okay. Understood. So it means that from next year, going forward, you are still above at least 10% legal reserve? Currently, that’s how we’re thinking. Yes. We will decide each year, okay? We have a very big return in that product. You know that, okay? Okay. Thank you. Next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. Thank you. My first question is can you give us the numbers of the fabless DOI existing 1Q 2019? And what’s your expectation by the end of this quarter? How many days above? Probably at the end of 1Q 2019, probably around 10 days, roughly, okay? This is based on our own calculation, by the way. And in the middle of this year, probably reduce down to very low single-digit. That’s why we say it’s close to the seasonal level. I need to add a little clarification here. The so-called fabless DOI is according to TSMC’s own top 32 fabless customers DOI. It is not the entire fabless industry. Thank you. Okay. So for – just also one follow-up on that is the definition of your fabless, does that include some system company? No, it’s just only the fabless, the pure semiconductor companies?
Okay. So I had an impression that earlier the company mentioned that the days of – fabless days of inventory may continue to stay a few days above seasonal level throughout second half this year. So is that still the case based on the current outlook? Very close to seasonal, so we did not come in a few days above. No. Okay? Okay. But – close to seasonal, but maybe not like really at a seasonal level? Well, I would like to say that probably below seasonal level, but we – it’s too early for us. We don’t have enough data to do all the analysis and too early for us to forecast accurately, say, how many days or below or above, all right? But we make our own judgment from the wafer loading and the past histories data. So we make our own calculation, so we observe that their inventory is greatly reduced in the second quarter. We are confident actually that in the middle of this year, we will be very close to the seasonal level. Thank you. My second question is on the smartphone growth outlook for this year. Remember last quarter, the company guided smartphone to grow slightly this year. And now it’s like high single-digit. So it seems like about like five percentage point higher based on our own calculation. And I think you also mentioned about also market share gain, content increase. This time, also the same reason. So I just wonder which of these two factors have surprised on the upside in the past three months? Well, we gain market share. That’s – and actually, our customers gain market share, let me say that. And that is kind of good news to TSMC, although we did not forecast that at the beginning of this year. Great. That was actually my follow-up question. So in terms of the market share gain and what’s a surprise on the upside in the past three months, how much of that is your own share gain in the AP or baseband or semiconductor chip? Or how much of that is your customers gain share, so you benefit? Which one is more important? How can we separate that one out because of all the high-end smartphones, APs are all in TSMC. So you want me to separate all these customers' gain or TSMC’s gain, I cannot separate out. It’s all in TSMC. Right. Right. But are you – would you be worried about potential like – maybe some of your high-end smartphone customers gain share right now, but that might cannibalize some of the – your other high-end smartphone customers in second half this year? Well, so long as – so long or the high-end smartphone continue to grow or so long TSMC has a very high market share. We just do our job to support them. Okay. Dr. Sun, can I just have one more follow-up? Do you object? There’s no objection, so you may continue. Thank you. So on the HPC side, also it seems like growth is better than last quarter guidance. I remember it was slight growth without crypto. Now it is high single digit, so also about five percent point higher. I think that C.C. earlier mentioned about is major due to the networking on the 5G deployment. So is it mainly driven by one or two few customers or several customers across the board? In the 5G area, yes, many players. And all of them are now very optimistic. And so the 5G deployment is faster than we initially planned, okay? That’s a trend right now. So we are forecasting higher growth than three months ago. Okay. So it’s very widespread rather than one or two chip customers? Thank you. You are right. JPMorgan’s Gokul has a follow-up question. Thanks for taking the follow-up question. My first question, I just wanted to clarify. I think last time, we mentioned N7+ could be about $1 billion or slightly higher than that of revenue in 2019. Are we still seeing that or customers are still staying on N7 for this year? We are ramping up N7+ right now, but the revenue for this year is still a little bit less than $1 billion. And as I just mentioned, next year is that one we try to look at it. I will believe most of the customers will adopt the N6 because that’s much easier for them to move into. And the benefit is almost the same as N7+. So I will say N7+ this year, a little bit below $1 billion. Next year, it probably won’t grow, but N6 will start to pick up. Okay. That’s very clear. My second question, Dr. Wei, could you explain a little bit more on what you encompass when you talk about heterogeneous integration? I think some of your customers have talked about packaging multiple process technologies in the same package. I think some of the customers' forward-running researchers even talked about multiple process in the same wafer. Could you talk a little bit about what is TSMC’s vision when we – when it comes to heterogeneous integration maybe in the next couple of years since you’re starting to showcase the technology and potentially going to production? That is a very complex question to be answered. Actually, while working with the customer and – different customer has a different need, but the trend on the heterogeneous integration is what we believe that what we – the few – the future that a lot of customer will adopt. But because of the benefit that when the circuit at some speed now is limited by the connection from the chip to chip, connection chip to chip is convolution. So that has to be shortened and – to gain the benefit of your single chip as a high performance. So you want to put them together. You better to reserve your signal’s integrity. You better has a very minimal capacitance, minimal inductance, minimal loss in the resistance.
So we – that’s what I say heterogeneous integration become important because we are using the InFO. We are using the CoWoS to help our customer to integrate all of them together with the most efficient way to connect all the chip together and also extending if you need high band with module that will one of the benefits that using TSMC’s CoWoS or InFO and – so if you ask me what is the application in the future, HPC will be the one that will adopt this kind of process. That’s the first one to go into. But of course, today, mobile smartphone already adopted the InFO technology as you knew already. And more and more of the high-end smartphone and more and more of the HPC’s customer will adopt TSMC’s advanced packaging method, including heterogeneous integration. So then we shouldn’t expect that advanced packaging just keeps rising as a percentage of your revenue in a pretty steady manner for the next few years? You’re right. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley’s Charlie Chan. So first of all, we will breakdown by application. It was very helpful. Just – can you give us some clarification. For example, the consumer application on smartphone platform. Can you give us some illustration for this kind of semiconductors? What is the consumer application by applying the smartphone platform? Or you can just ignore those kind of minor contribution? Probably – I – do you have any good answer to that one, the consumer inside a smartphone? I don’t know. You mean the consumer inside smartphone? Yes. Well, if you are using the smartphone to do the gaming, can I say it’s a consumer function inside a smartphone? Yes. I think your definition, for example, for GPU in gaming or for AI or for PC, I think that was clear, right, but you – now you provide a more breakdown, we really appreciate. I just wanted to make sure we don’t get it wrong. Video games is a consumer application now is in HPC and set-top box, digital TV, cordless phone, these are consumer applications now in the digital consumer electronics. Okay. Okay. So also my next question is about your supply chain management, right, related to your kind of high inventory level, right? So now how is the roll wafer inventory at the foundry. And do you plan to reduce some shipment from those roll wafer vendors? And also regarding that previous chemical issue, we do get any compensation from your chemical vendors? I will answer first part of the question. Our DOI actually including an increase of roll wafer inventory. So on a Q-o-Q basis, it does increase a few days of our own DOI because we have very low first and second quarter and we have a contract with those wafer companies. But moving to a second half as our demand pick up, those DOI on roll wafer, we’ll gradually digest it to a normal level. This is the first part of your question. What is the second question? The chemical issue caused some damage, right? So will you get any reimbursements or compensation from your – or TSMC will book it as kind of expense? So what is our... Chemical quality... The photoresist event, yes, and what we do? Yes. In terms of financial. Do we ask for financial compensation? Yes. I have no comment on that one. Okay. No problem. And also, C.C., regarding your comments about 5-nanometer will have a bigger, larger scale and 7-nanometer because kind of wider applications. So my question is that besides exceeding 7-nanometer customers and applications, what will be the new customer or application for 5-nanometer? We are – actually, we are engaging with the new big customers and they are expanding their product portfolio into HPC area and that part we [indiscernible]. Okay. So that’s why we say that 5-nanometer business probably will be bigger than the 7-nanometer. Yes. Yes. And lastly, I guess on M&A, right, because your subsidiary Vanguard acquired GlobalFoundries inch cap early this year, right? So would you consider to do any M&A from those kind of overseas fab at some point? We don’t have a plan right now. Of course, if there’s a good opportunity or everything that meet our strategy, we will consider, but we don’t have any plan of M&A right now. Okay. Yes. And follow-up question to Gokul’s question regarding the profitability, right? So I guess last year in one big event you said GlobalFoundries exceed the leading-edge, right? But if you look at first half gross margin, I think it was much below previous cycle’s margin. So do you think that your bargain power really improved after this industry consolidation? And how do you think about Samsung’s EUV technology compared to your 5- or 6-nanometer? Thanks. You’re talking about margin or profitability. Let me say that I think that the first quarter, second quarter’s, most of the [indiscernible] in the 7-nanometer loading. The loading is so low that affect our margin by four points in the first quarter, by three points in the second quarter. So the loading is actually the dominant one. It’s not because of others. You’re talking about the EUV status compared with my competitor. All I can say is we are very confident that we can ramp-up the EUV right now. And we believe our – the maturity or the readiness of the EUV technology, TSMC definitely is better than others. Follow-up question from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. I just have two quick follow-ups. One for Lora on the dividend. Since you’re moving to quarterly in first quarter approving for fourth quarter this year, next quarter would you declare for first quarter of 2020? And is it the view for 2020 you’ll declare quarterly or will get said amount for the full year next year? After the shareholder meeting, we’ll declare the $2, which is the first quarter dividend will be paid in fourth quarter this year. And so every quarter from then, we will declare cash dividend and will be paid within six months. So first quarter next year, you will get a dividend from our board approval in third quarter this year. So that will continue going on. Did I make myself clear? Yes. That part is clear. And then so every quarter we’ll declare, but is there a goal... Yes. Every quarter, we will declare dividend. Okay. And so your goal then for each year to still be stable or can it rise through... Yes. That’s right. Stable. Okay. Good. Okay. And then one follow-up just Charlie on the margins. Just relative to the revision you made, sales actually came in a little bit better, but the gross margin came in toward the lower end of the range. I guess just relative if there were some factors that you saw in the last month that might have affected near term because it looks like by medium term, you have margin getting back toward 50. Actually, when we gave the guidance on February, it’s a range, right? So we are still within a range. So there are a few factors may have swing the gross margin, photoresist definitely one. Actually, the actual number was slightly deviated from what we have said in February, but still within the range, okay? Going forward, as I said in my remarks, we are thinking the 50% gross margin is still a good target for us. Really mean if we can achieve better utilization, we can go back to 50, but it will be depending on each quarter’s demand profile. I’m not ready to give you third quarter and fourth quarter separately, but what I can say is our gross margin will improve in third quarter and we will further improve in fourth quarter. Thank you. Now with this very positive note on the margins and also as our CEO said, we have passed the bottom of the cycle for our business and we are launching the industry’s competitive leading-edge technologies. With volume production already taken place using EUV, I think let’s end our conference today with such a high note. Thank you for coming to our event today, and we hope to see you next quarter. Thank you.",the earthquake that just took place at 1:10 this afternoon has no impact on TSMC’s fabs or the back-end packaging fab . today’s event is webcast live through the tsmc.com website . the format of today's event will be as follows .,1.0

And now I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC's CFO, Ms. Lora Ho, for the summary of operations and quarter -- current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon.  My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter and followed by the guidance of the third quarter.
Our second quarter revenue increased 10.2% quarter-over-quarter as we already passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and began to see demand increases. Gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points sequentially to 43% mainly due to the absence of photoresist defect material incident and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate. Total operating expenses represented 11.2% of net revenue, lower than 11.9% in the first quarter. Operating margin increased by 2.3 percentage points sequentially to 31.7%. Overall, our second quarter's EPS was $2.57, and ROE was 16.2%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology accounted for 21% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, 10-nanometer was 3%, and 16-nanometer was 23%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 47% of wafer revenue, up from 42% in the first quarter.
Now let's talk about the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to accounted for 45% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 23% to accounted for 32%. IoT increased 15% to accounted for 8%. Automotive increased 3% to accounted for 5%. Digital consumer electronics and others went down slightly, accounted for 8% (sic) [ 6% ] or 4% each of our wafer revenue.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 765 billion, an increase of TWD 4 billion from the last quarter. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by 220 -- TWD 244 billion as we accrued about TWD 259 billion for 2018 and for first quarter 2019. 2018 cash dividend of TWD 8 per share will be paid today. And the first quarter 2019 dividend of TWD 2 per share will be paid out in October.
On financial ratios, accounts receivables turnover days decreased 7 days to 42 days. Days of inventory decreased 3 days to 76 days primarily due to lower days in work-in-progress inventories and finished goods, both of which resulted from higher shipments out of inventories built in first quarter '19.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 118 billion cash from operations and spent TWD 116 billion in capital expenditure. As a result, we generated free cash flow of TWD 1.4 billion, and our overall cash balance increased TWD 4 billion to TWD 650 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditure was USD 3.75 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect third quarter revenue to be between USD 9.1 billion and USD 9.2 billion, which is an 18% sequential increase at the midpoint.  Based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31.0, gross margin is expected to be between 46% and 48%. Operating margin is expected to be between 35% and 37%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about profitability, CapEx and the cash dividend.
First, about profitability. Let me make some comments on our second quarter and third quarter and our overall profitability outlook. Our second quarter '19 gross margin improved by 1.7 percentage points sequentially mainly due to the absence of the photoresist material incident from first quarter and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate. The reason second quarter revenue is slightly above the high end of our guidance but gross margin is at the low end is because the pace of cost improvement at N7 did not meet our plan in second quarter. But we expect costs to gradually improve towards the plan starting from the third quarter. We have just guided third quarter '19 gross margin to improve by 4 percentage points sequentially at the midpoint mainly as we expect a higher level of overall capacity utilization.
Our gross margin in first half '19 was primarily impacted by a low capacity utilization rate. But as our business and utilization rate improved in the second half of this year, we believe about 50% is still a good target for our gross margin going forward.
Now regarding 2019 CapEx planning. At the end -- at the beginning of this year, we have guided our 2019 CapEx budget to be between USD 10 billion and USD 11 billion. However, over the last 3 months, we have seen an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. We believe this will lead to an increase in demand for our 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies beyond the level we forecasted 3 months ago. We are, therefore, working closely with our customers on the most effective capacity planning for our N5 and N7. We expect our 2019 CapEx is likely to exceed the high end of our guidance range. We are currently evaluating our 2019 CapEx plans and expect to provide you a more detailed update during our October earnings conference.
The last comment is about the cash dividend distribution. We have communicated our dividend policy earlier this year. We will have sustainable cash dividend per share on both an annual and a quarterly basis. In addition, as our free cash flow increase, we will distribute about 70% of our free cash flow as cash dividend. TSMC's AGM in June approved the Board's approval of TWD 8 cash dividend per share and full year -- for full year 2018 and the revision of the Article of Incorporation to adapt quarterly dividends. The Board then approved TWD 2 per share dividend for the first quarter 2019 which will be distributed in October 2019. Therefore, TSMC's shareholder will receive a total of TWD 10 cash dividend per share this year. That also means shareholder will receive at least TWD 10 per share cash dividend for 2020. Going forward, TSMC has set the payment months for the quarterly dividend as January, April, July and October of each year.
This concludes my remarks. Now I would like to turn to C.C. Wei for his comments. Thank you, Lora. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me start with the near-term demand and inventory. We conclude our second quarter with revenue of TWD 241 billion or USD 7.75 billion, slightly above our guidance due to a higher demand from HPC and IoT applications as compared to the time when we gave guidance. Although our business continue to be impacted by the softer overall global economic condition, customer inventory management and high-end mobile product seasonality, we have also passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and began to see demand increasing.
Moving into third quarter this year. TSMC's business will be driven by new product launches of premium smartphones, the acceleration of 5G development and the increasing adoption of our industry-leading 7-nanometer node by high-performance computing applications.
Now let's talk about the inventory. Our fabless customers' overall inventory is being gradually digested throughout second quarter. We expect it to reduce to several days above seasonal level exceeding the second quarter, leading to an improved inventory environment for the second half of this year. Although a soft global economic condition and trade uncertainties remain, we expect our business to be much stronger in the second half as compared with the first half of this year due to the strong demand for our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology solutions.
The progress of our advanced technologies were on track, and we are very confident in our technology leadership. Over the last 3 months, we have seen an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This would speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network and smartphones in several major markets around the world. We expect this to lead to an increase in demand for our 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies. And we are working closely with our customers to carefully plan out capacity to meet their demand, as our CFO just said.
Now I will talk about the N5 status and N3 development. Our N5 technology has already entered risk production in first quarter. Customer tapeout activity are underway, and volume production is scheduled in first half of the year 2020 with 80% logic density gain, 8-0 percent, and 15% speed compared with the 7-nanometer, we believe our N5 technology is the most advanced in the foundry industry with the best density performance, power and transistor technology. Our 5-nanometer technology solution will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution until our 3-nanometers arrives. We are confident that our 5-nanometer will have a strong ramp and be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
On N3, the technology development progress is going well, and we are already engaging with the early customers and the technology definition. We expect our 3-nanometer technology to further extend our leadership position well into the future.
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the progress of N6. We have seen very strong demand at N7 across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC and IoT applications. Meanwhile, our N7+, which adapts EUV for a few critical layers, has already entered volume production. We expect our customers' end products using N7+ will be in the market in high volume this quarter. We expect strong demand to continue into next year.
N6 provide a clear migration path for second-wave N7 products as its design are 100% compatible with N7 while providing 18% logic density gain and performance to cost advantage. N6 will use more EUV layer than N7+. N6 risk production is scheduled to begin in first quarter year 2020 with customer product tapeouts in second half 2020. The volume production starts before the end of year 2020.
We reaffirm N7, N7+ will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in this year. And we expect even higher percentage in next year on N7, N7+ and N6 because development of 5G accelerates and demand from HPC, mobile and other applications continue to grow.
Now let me talk about TSMC's competitiveness. The foundry business model has proven to be the most efficient model in the semiconductor industry. As a pure-play dedicated foundry, we collaborate and work closely together with our customers to unleash their innovation to the market and enable their success. We do not have any internal products, and we do not compete with customers.
Within foundry, TSMC competes on technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customers' trust. Our trinity of strength enables us to be everyone's foundry. We have the most useful and robust technology offering across both advanced and specialty technologies. We work diligently to protect our customers' technology, extend our leadership and accelerate our technology differentiation. We are the world's largest entrusted provider of logic capacity with an excellent manufacturing track record. We will continue to unleash innovations for all our customers for years to come.
Finally, I'll talk about our CFO transition. After serving very well as TSMC's CFO for the past 16 years, Lora Ho will take on a new challenge as Head of Europe and Asia sales. Subject to the Board of Directors' approval, Wendell Huang will become TSMC's new CFO effective September 1. Wendell have been with TSMC for 20 years and have served as TSMC's Deputy CFO and Head of Finance Division. He brings a wealth of experience and knowledge of TSMC, and I am confident he will continue the strong tradition of TSMC's finance organization. I'm excited about both appointments and look forward to continue to work closely with both Lora and Wendell in their new roles.
Thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to limit your questions to 2 at a time so that all the participants have an opportunity to ask their questions. Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. For those of you on the call, if you would like to ask some questions, [Operator Instructions]. We'll start the questions first from Crédit Suisse's Randy Abrams. Maybe since it's Lora's last time and we also have 2 CFOs, so I'll start with the financial questions. On the gross margin, if you can elaborate just a bit more on what were the triggers for the slower progress on gross margin. As it seems uncharacteristic for TSMC at least recently to have a bit of impact on process ramp-up. And then looking forward on the 50%, if you still expect that target toward the end of this year and if looking into next year, as you ramp up 5 and normally have a 2- to 3-point impact, if you still expect 50% reasonable for next year? When we ramp up any new technologies, we have a series of productivity, cost improvement activities on the plan. 7-nanometer is the same. 7-nanometer now is very, very busy. There's a lot of new tapeout. So in second quarter, we have set a goal, but we did not achieve the goal. That is why, as I've explained earlier, the margin fall into the low end of the guidance. As I said earlier, we have -- back on track to gradually improve productivity and with the volume continue to come in third and fourth quarter. And we are still confident we can achieve our cost reduction and productivity target. As to the 50% gross margin, I think for the whole year, I think the main reason is the lower utilization particularly in the first half of the year. As I've said, if we can maintain the high utilizations, which we believe we can, the 50% is still a good target going forward. Okay. And that implies also fourth quarter, fourth quarter of this year? That is certainly my hope. Okay. Great. Okay. Second question, I actually wanted to ask a bit more on the sales growth outlook you've put out. And maybe the first starting point is you originally guided the full year would be growing back in April, and so I was wondering if you can update that expectation. And then to dig into the growth, if you could talk a bit about -- in that guidance for high-teens growth for the different segments, the HPC, auto, IoT, smartphones, how you're seeing each of those segments for second -- for third quarter and second half and if you're also seeing cryptocurrency come back. Well, for the first part, I think C.C. can answer, yes. Okay. What is the first part? Wrong question. First part was if you still think you can grow for this year? For the whole year? For the whole year. Let me give you some kind of a taste. Right now, the uncertainties really become in these days really hard to say, so I cannot give you kind of, again, a very firm number of what kind of a growth we are going to get, but I can assure you that the fourth quarter would be better than the third quarter. That's all I can say. Okay. How much? I don't know yet, so you can calculate for that. So the key is fourth quarter we think will be better than third quarter. So I think the second part maybe, Lora, can you answer? Randy, did you ask about the by-platform growth for third quarter? Yes. If -- actually, if you can just -- the third quarter and then an update on the full year for the platforms? Okay. Third quarter, as I just guided, there's a sequential 18% growth, we are seeing very strong growth on smartphone. And also, actually, all platform are going to grow in third quarter across the board with smartphone growing the most. And also, HPC is still growing very nicely. IoT is very strong although it's very small as a basis. And we also see automotive coming up to grow. It was kind of low in the first half of the year, okay? In terms of the whole year, we expect smartphone will grow single digit year-over-year. HPC, if exclude cryptocurrency, we will also see single-digit growth. But with the cryptocurrency, it's a declining number. IoT will grow more than double digit, very nicely. Automotive will be a down platform for the year, okay? So that is the segment analysis. Just the final clarification. For cryptocurrency, if you're seeing -- like how much of that activity is coming back? And do you expect to target that and then if you have the new capacity on 7 tied to that? On that one, C.C., will you answer that, yes? Yes. The cryptocurrency, recently, the pricing is up, and so we start to see the demand improving. We support the cryptocurrency's available capacities. Next question will be also coming from the floor from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. My first question is about your full year outlook. I think there's the uncertainty about the U.S.-China tension. Huawei's still in the release, right? So when you plan the full year or even fourth quarter, do you discount that risk? How much do you discount that risk from Huawei? And also, I think that there's a demand to [ intuition ]. I mean the biggest impact to the industry could be the 5G infrastructure from the U.S.-China tension. You have seen that infrastructure demand is accelerating, right? So can you give us some sense of what you see differently about the infrastructure markets? All right. The effect of Huawei being the Entity List and impact to TSMC, we do see some impact but not direct business between Huawei and TSMC and to the HiSilicon and TSMC because we are -- we already announced that we continue our shipping practice. Because we follow the law, so we continue to ship. The infrastructure -- actually, the 5G's development actually accelerate, and we see a very strong demand from that. And as I said in my statement, in many countries, that they speed up the 5G deployment, and we see the increase of the demand at our leading-edge 7-nanometer. Yes. So yes, it seems that, for example, being in the Entity List,  Huawei still has some discretion to update, for example, Google's mobile service. And that has impact their overseas smartphone demand. And according to your breakdown, the smartphone business still can see single-digit Y-o-Y growth, right? So I'm wondering, have you discount the potential downside risk if that Entity List issue is going to last longer. Actually, I don't want to specifically pinpoint one customer only. All I can say is the second half, the new smartphone launches, especially the premium grade, has been the seasonality phenomena for us, always the second half. And the acceleration of the 5G actually enhance this kind of increase. That's all I can say. Let me add a little bit, too. Of course, the second half, there are still a lot of uncertainties, right, the geopolitical part, trade policy changes still go with the time. But I think the second half, the biggest growth momentum comes from the new smartphone launches. On Huawei's factors, yes, we think we did the discount. But Huawei -- since Huawei's been, many things happens, too. The downside is generally the smartphone market becoming uncertain in addition to Huawei themselves. So the whole Huawei -- whole smartphone market is suppressed, I think. And secondly is the trade barrier. Trade uncertainties still prevail in all sectors. So from all sectors, particularly the industrial and the consumer, I think that we will still see the momentum still coming -- not coming back. And -- but of course, the 5G momentum picking up, that is also new for the world globally, in U.S., in China, in Korea, in Japan and so forth. So those all factors combined, we think we try to make the best judgment and think that's the conclusion C.C. just delivered. Okay. That's very helpful. And my next question is to Lora. It's going to be a tough question before you transfer to another role. So a follow-up in this -- Randy's question, right? So compare your third quarter revenue scale versus the revenue scale in the first quarter 2018, that quarter you made 50% gross margin, right? So that means you have a higher scale, but the gross margin, I think, is 3 percentage point or 4 percentage points than that quarter, right? So I'm asking you whether there's any structural issue. And also, more specifically, your 7-nanometer is in the second year, right? So supposedly, it shouldn't cause the -- any margin dilution anymore, especially you are saying that 7-nanometer fab is quite busy, right? So can you explain why revenue scale is higher, fab is busy, second year of the new nodes, but gross margin's low a few quarters ago. Actually, utilization is still the main factor if you'll compare on year-over-year basis. Of course, there is still some dilution for N7, but this dilution will start diminishing as we have much strong demand in the second half, okay? Another thing is there's a little bit of a product mix issue. You do have -- we have portfolio of product mix. We have talked about this. There's certain technology is not -- surprisingly, is low. For example, 28-nanometer, that has some impact on our overall corporate margin. So those are the things I can think of that related to the margin changes, okay? All right. We will go to the line now. Operator, please have the first caller on the line. The first question comes from the line of Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. First question, there's been a lot of discussion recently about more competitions from one of your foundry competitors. Could you, C.C., talk a little bit about a road map on 5-nanometer and especially your 3-nanometer? One of your competitors is looking to introduce a new infrastructure like gate-all-around. Is this going to stick with the FinFET and 3-nanometer as well? Or if it's also likely to move to a nanosheet or gate-all-around structure? That's my first question.
Secondly, could we talk a little bit about what is the activity level TSMC is seeing at 5-nanometer capacity? I think previously, you've mentioned that 5-nano is seeing -- you're building the 5-nanometer capacity for next year. And could we also talk a little bit about how our customers are thinking in terms of choosing for 6-nanometer versus 5-nanometer especially the customers who are on 7-nanometer today? All right. Gokul, it seems -- I guess because you have a flu, so we didn't -- we can't really hear you quite well. But let me try to see if I understand your questions. First, your question is with regard to the competition within foundry. You asked whether we can compare our technology road map of 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer versus that of the competitors. And your second question is with respect to 5-nanometer where you asked that we seem to be a little bit more conservative about 5-nanometer capacity build plan some time ago, and now we are a bit more aggressive. And so you are asking us if we have seen any difference we see in customers' demand for 5-nanometer. C.C., would you answer the first question? Yes, yes, yes. The first question? First question is 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. We think our 5-nanometer is very competitive and the first one in the industry in that geometry. And what is the risk production right now and the volume production in the first half in the next year, these continue to be the same situation. And about the 3-nanometer, let me tell you about it a bit. We have evaluated all the possible options and come with a very good solution for our customer. We continue to work with our customer to define the spec, to define the approaches and to meet their requirement and are updating you about our choices next time. Let me add that, actually, our 5-nanometer is a full-node stride from our 7-nanometer. And our 3-nanometer is another full node stride from our 5-nanometer. This is very different than our competitors' road map. So if you compare their numerical, 3 is probably closer to the 5. Secondly, on the 5-nanometer capacity build -- the second question is 5-nanometer capacity. Yes, what type do we see in customer demand. Okay, it's C.C. now. Okay. The 5-nanometer, in the last quarter when we communicated with you, we said that we are going to be a little bit conservative and to work with customer to plan the capacity that's necessary to support them. Now in these 3 months, because of a speed-up of 5G's development, we are working with the customer again. We have to up our -- probably we change our conservative attitude to become a little bit more aggressive and so to meet our customer's demand. Right now, this is a new development all because of 5G AI's progress. All right. Let's come back to the floor. Next question will be coming from Goldman Sachs' Bruce Lu. So the last couple of months has been pretty exciting in terms of the microenvironment. So I think there are some changes in terms of customer behavior. Typically, we somehow synchronize their production together with their sales. So if they have some problem in terms of the sales so they somehow change their production plan. There may be some time lag. But the last couple of months, we saw the feedback that customer is willing to be piling up more inventory, is willing to -- there are some disruption in terms of their sales in plan. But in terms of production plan, you don't really see a lot of meaningful changes at least for TSMC. So how do we forecast this kind of thing moving forward? It seems to me that the microenvironment seems so dynamic, but we have -- as analyst, we have a lot of difficulties, right? We can't just follow the tweets. So can you help us how to do the -- how do you predict that kind of customer behavior in terms of the production planning moving forward? That's an interesting question. You ask us how we estimate or forecast the customers' inventory or how they plan out their component. Let me tell you that TSMC only receive the PO we put into production. Okay? And we did not see that strange customer's behavior and see that they are padding up of the product in expectation of something happen. Now we did not see that. That in our -- in our daily life, again, let me stress one point. We receive the PO, we do the production, and we did not see a very strange kind of phenomena. So don't follow the tweet. As the fabless inventory, I think Lora just reported is coming down. But one of the important customer, they don't provide the public information. That's right. That becomes a biggest win factors, right? Most system companies, we have the inside look. But the company you just mentioned, yes indeed, we do not know their inventories. But from their orders stream, we don't see any abnormal flow. I see. The second thing is the management kept on mentioning about our 5G's acceleration. Can you give us some like granularity of like what kind of revenue contribution coming from 5G in second half 2019 or 2020, either from smartphone side or from infrastructure side? What is the revenue exposure to TSMC at this moment? Lora, do we have 5G specific pointed out? We don't. It's difficult to kind of differentiate how much demand is coming from 5G. We track the demand on node basis, also on platform basis. 5G maybe related to HPC, some of the smartphone as well. We do see those 2 segment are growing very strongly, if any. Yes. Let me add some color to it. Actually, the networking processor, FPGA product, even some CPUs and also base stations, smartphone, that [ OI ] in 5G. And we see a very, very strong demand in the second half of this year. I think the question you're asking about, the exposure of 5G, can you elaborate what that means? Well, basically, it's now -- that is the strongest demand as management just mentioned, right? So basically, we try to get some granularity or we try to quantify how much growth we can expect moving forward, right? So yes, as I said, it can be any kind of product. So -- but the bigger revenue contribution still comes from the base station and the smartphone side, right? So that's the key area we are we are trying to focus on. Yes. And the smartphone adopt -- implementation of 5G on the smartphone, we see actually stronger than when we were at 4G's ramp, okay? That's the information you get. And that is the opportunity before us as we consider here. Lastly, can I squeeze in, like can we still maintain that 5 years' revenue CAGR's guidance? Sure. Okay. So that's the confirmation. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. Will the 7-nanometer reach 25% of total revenue this year? And 7-nanometer will be the biggest node ever in revenue to TSMC this year? And next year, C.C., you expect 7-nanometer will be growing even more than 25% of total revenue next year? So it means that 7-nanometer will be even bigger. And then, C.C., you also said 5-nanometer going forward will be a big and long-lasting node and also will be growing bigger than 7-nanometer. So are you still maintaining this view with -- that the 7-nanometer is going to be very big next year? First, let me say again. It will be very big next year, all right? And the 5, we are -- so [indiscernible] and the 5-nanometer vertical, we see that -- we forecast the ramp-up will be faster than, in terms of the revenue, faster than 7-nanometer. And we expect that our 5-nanometer is a solution to all the customer is very competitive. And the 5G AI, again, that will be a benefit to 5G, so the 5-nanometers, of course, and the 7-nanometer. Yes. So for next year, first, you are going to ramp 5-nanometer very fastly. And then you still have a very a big 7-nanometer. So for next year, so what is the overall growth outlook for you for next year? Let's wait for next year, then I'll give you the answer. But all your statements are true. Okay. Second question actually is also related to this 7-nanometer and the 5-nanometer. So now your 7+ is -- I'm sorry, I missed the fact sheet, so how is the EUV availability and the productivity for your 7+ so far? Has it reached the net capacity now? The EUV, we don't see any problem in production. So it's growing very well, on schedule, and we are very happy about it. How does the EUV productivity or availability compare to emerging in the same stage? Same stage. Same stage, that's a long time ago. So far, it's -- on our schedule, everything's according to the plan. So that's all I can say. Okay. So just on outlook, do you -- so for next year, you verified the 7-nanometer and the 5-nanometer ramp. So is this EUV going to be a big dilution to the gross margin next year? Oh, that's a tough question. All I can say is that EUV will perform as we scheduled, all right? And EUV will be important in our cost-reduction path. All right. Let's go back to the line. Operator, please have the next caller on the line. Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. A couple of follow-ups. On the CapEx item, how should I think about the higher-than-expected CapEx in 2019? Is that more of the tour in for 2020? Or your capital intensity is going to remain at a higher level looking forward? We are still working on the CapEx number. We're going to report to you next quarter. I think in terms of the rushing, we are seeing more CapEx requirement both for 7-nanometer, also for 5-nanometer. For 5-nanometer, we need to pull in the tour to meet customers' request, okay? So in terms of capital intensity, you'll probably see a -- in a short-term period, it will go higher than what I have guided, the 30% level. But in the longer term, we still believe the 30% level is still the right level of CapEx intensity. And just a quick follow-up on your view on Q4. I get a sense that there are still uncertain environment. What is the one end market that is the most variable when you think about the trend into Q4? Could you please repeat the question? Mehdi, you are asking what is the one end market that is most vulnerable or valuable? I didn't... If that makes it more challenging to you to forecasting Q4? Most challenging, okay, for Q4. Yes. Well, I think the most recent Japan and Korea dispute probably is the most uncertain one for the fourth quarter here. Sure. Sure. So how should I think about its impact by a specific end market? Is that more of a broad-based unknown factor? Is the unknown more of the broad-based macroeconomic trends? Or is that specific to one particular end market? It is so uncertain that we don't -- cannot pin down specific products that are being impacted. People talk about smartphone itself could be impacted. But it's breaking down many supply chains. So it is including display or other electronic components. So that is the difficult part for us to make an estimation. Okay. Great. May I ask you one more question? Okay. All right. Sure. Sure. I'll make it quick. I'll make it quick. But we -- I think there is no doubt that 5G opportunities are enormous. And -- but I just want to better understand how TSMC is planning. Carriers refer to a commercial end market or commercial after the 5G as more meaningful than consumer and handset. On the other hand, your customers'  companies highlight the opportunities in the smartphone. So as you plan for your capacity -- leading-edge capacity plans, it's a very long lead time. How do you think about 5G and its impact on consumer, which is more of a handset or smartphone versus a commercial aspect, which could have an impact on your HPC or other segment? Well, actually, let me answer the question because 5G, what we expect is not only on the consumer products like a smartphone, per se. I do think that 5G will affect to every area in our platform. For example, without 5G, the autonomous driving will not be possible. So it's very important for automotive also. It's very important for the high-performance computing also because that's one of the networking process where everything is connected.
It's also important for the IoT because that's where you connect all the data. And with -- the 5G is a multichannel with a voice [ latency ] with very high-speed and with the -- and all the data collection need to be analyzed. So I think in terms of 5G, the effect on the business and also on TSMC's capacity plan is enormous. So we are -- what TSMC is doing is right now working with all the customers to plan for their businesses and plan our own capacity. That's all I can say. Let me add some color for this. 5G, I think the -- if you look at next year, the biggest business influencer should be in the smartphone. And secondly, it will be the high-performance computing, which composed of the networking and other infrastructures. As far as the automotive and the IoT consumer, we have a high expectation for that. But I think it will take some time before the usage model get implemented in the market. That will come back -- come to us later. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Lu from UBS. First of all, I just want to say thank you to Lora for all the help over the years and patience in answering all of the questions. So thanks a lot and the best of luck.
My first question is again on 7-nanometers. If I go back and look at TSMC for 28-nanometers, that was TSMC's most successful node of all time, and that coincided with the big smartphone ramp. If I now look at 7, you've got the move from 4G to 5G, but you're also adding HPC. How do I think about the -- yes, if I look at capacity for 7, is it reasonable to assume that it could be bigger than 28? 7, at this same stage, it’s bigger than 28. Are we... Yes. Okay. So my members say yes, but I think I don't think so. I think revenue-wise, 7-nanometer would definitely be much bigger than 28-nanometer but not necessarily the capacity. Yes. Not the capacity. Okay. Can you give me a sense for ultimately how big 7 capacity could be relative to 28? It's more about its growth at the same stage. Okay. Great. Maybe I could ask that a different way. Well, just if you look at 7-nanometer demand, let's say, a year from now, what do you think is the split between HPC, smartphones and maybe the other platforms? Bill is asking, a year from today, if we look back and look at the 7-nanometer revenue, what will be the split between HPC, smartphone and other platforms. We don't have the specific number. But if you look at today's HPC and smartphone percentage ratio, I think it will be probably similar, although a fraction of the smartphone may not be the leading-edge. But for those 2 sectors, most of -- both sectors are closer to the leading-edge. So both of the factors -- both of those segments will go to 7-nanometer. So probably, smartphone will still be bigger than HPC. It's similar ratio, I think. That's the business we have today. Great. My second question is on 5-nanometers. So a quarter ago, I asked Dr. Wei about the cost per transistor at 5-nanometers. And I heard some of the feedback from customers is that maybe it's not coming down as fast as expected. And I think Dr. Wei's answer was that he had some [indiscernible] working at it -- is working on it. I'm just wondering, can you give me an update on that? Whether costs have seen improvement? Or what's the status there? [Foreign Language] Excuse me, you're asking the device improvement? Or is it demand improvement? No, sorry. I think if you look at cost per transistor for 5-nanometers, it's not coming down as fast as previous nodes. I'm wondering if you have an update there. No, I don't have any update except that right now we see a much more stronger demand. Great. Thank you, Bill. Let's come back to the floor. Next question will be coming from Daiwa's Rick Hsu. Just one question from me. I think, Lora, just talking about your -- this year's revenue rose by different platforms. So like smartphone, up a single digit; high performance, single digit up; and IoT, up double digit. So if I recall my memory, this set of guidance looks the same as that you've provided early this year. So can I fairly assume by your total revenue that you guys still keep the same guidance of the revenue for the whole year? Will be up slightly year-on-year? There is still uncertainty on fourth quarter. What I can say now is fourth quarter revenue will be higher than third quarter. Okay. Fair enough. Just one quick follow-up. Can also you update us this year's Global Semi outlook and also GLOBALFOUNDRIES? Next -- you mean 2020? No, no, no, this year. Yes. This year. This year's? This year, our foundry actually is a little bit negative. Semi, excluding memory, negative 3%. Foundry, negative 1% this year. So we have been truthfully answered your question. All right. Next question will be coming from Crédit Suisse's Randy. I just wanted to -- there's been a lot of press and maybe it's noise about customers evaluating other foundries. So I'm talking about strong 5G, HPC. Are you -- I'm just curious if you're factoring in any offsets? Like in the past, you've had couple major customers like go back and forth between foundries. So as you look at the next couple of years, do you see that much -- like how do you see your market share? And do you see any offsets to that strength over the next couple of years? Well, we can see the strong competition. But let me assure you that our technologies and leadership and also that our manufacturing are excellent. We saw our customer's trust. I believe we are going to maintain our market share and increase the market share. Did I answer your question? Yes. Well, within that because we know about some projects like customers like AMD that have shut down or switched from GLOBALFOUNDRIES. So it's more of if you also see any offsetting drags that we should factor in just so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves, if there's anything that we saw a few years ago. We had a mobile customer shift foundries. Like if you see any offsets -- or from a market share, it still looks like -- I think in the past you've said you have pretty much all the customers. But if you still view that on the [ present ]? Yes. We factor what the possible competitors' sales approach. We factor it in, yes. Okay. And then if I could ask on the nodes. Actually, 2 of them. One on -- as the 7 matures over the next couple of years, how you now see the variation of 7+ and 6 because I think in the past, you saw that as becoming mainstream. If you still think that 7 evolves that way or most of the customers move to the EUV version, 7+ or 6. And then for 5, for next year, how concentrated do you see that both in terms of customers? And then also if it's concentrated smartphone or you see a lot of HPC. Let me answer that. I believe you asked about the 7+ or 6, right, will the 2 continue the 7-nanometers node. Actually, we would believe that both of the customer, especially the second wave customer, wants to adopt 6, okay? Because it's 100% compatible with the 7, that reduce their burden with design or the IPs. So the 6 will be a very sweet spot for them to continue with the 7 route. That's one, okay. 7+, this year actually is -- we provide a better performance and better density for some of the customers that have been adopted. And they will continue to grow. The majority, as I said, will be going to 6. As for 5, 5 would be adopted by a lot of platform, that's including the smartphone, the mobile, including the high performance computing. And let me see, what else? IoT, no, no. We do not see IoT yet. At the beginning, it will be mobile and HPC. Next question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. My first question is a little bit of follow-up on Randy's questions. So you've re-narrowed down Randy's questions to a very leading-edge technology, the market share. Let's say, sub 10-nanometers market share in the next 3 years. What's TSMC's expectation on that? Are we going to maintain or further increase market share here? We want to maintain well. We have a very high market share. Very high. So the -- but in terms of the very high, like, 95 is high. 90 is high. So from 95 to 90, there are... You want to know about the number? I want to know the direction. I think direction, probably, our 16 is higher than our 28. And our 7 will be higher than our 16 and on, yes. All right. And then what's your expectation of 5 versus 7? 5, it's too early to say. But we target to be higher than 7. Okay. My second question is can TSMC talk about the possibility of building the fab or acquire a fab company in the United States? And would this is -- would this be out of the geopolitical concerns? Or any other consideration? Of course, geopolitical concern is everybody's concerns. However, if you want to answer how can we solve the concern, it's not that simple. It's not building a fab outside Taiwan or any other country can solve that problem, yes? However, we are always open to build a fab in overseas, provided we can provide the same cost structure to our customers and to our investors. So far, in the U.S, we have talked to the industry and to see whether that is a viable approach, is a good approach to our customers, given the cost differences and if given by the -- in addition to the local subsidies. But still, it's -- current supply from Taiwan is still the best solution for our customers. So we are open to that, but we are not in a hurry to make a decision. Of course, we also see some unproductive facility overseas. We don't want to increase the excess capacity for the industry. Therefore, the possible -- in addition, the approach of building a greenfield fab acquisition is probably -- is better for the industry. That's our current consideration. But we don't have a definitive plan today that we are going to have that in the U.S. at this point, yes. Great. Can I just conclude that -- so TSMC's preference is to -- if you're going to do this, your option will -- your preferred option will be buy rather than build. At this point, yes. Okay. I understand. Can I add more -- one more question? Follow up later. Okay. I'll come in later. Yes. Next will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. I would like to switch gears to 8-inch. So you load your 8-inch at the [indiscernible]. I think it's probably below corporate average in first half. So how do you see your 8-inch demand or utilization in second half? The second half will be better. Actually it's because of smartphone's seasonality. So the 8-inch's utilization rate will be much higher than the first half. How do you compare with your corporate average? Let me give you some taste that some of the segment actually is fully loaded. Okay. So this is the demand across the board. So it's not just on your -- for certain customers' rush order? Oh, you said demand across the board. Because of what -- I'm talking about the product segment. Okay. And second question, how about your Nanjing fab? So can you give us a color or update for your Nanjing fab? Nanjing fab's progress went well. The loading is very healthy, and we continue our plan. We will contribute 20,000 wafers per month capacity over there. Any plan to -- above this 20,000? Right now 20,000 is our plan. Now let's go back to the line. Operator, please have the caller on the line, the next one. Next question comes from the line of [ Susie Ju ] from Standard & Poor's. Just have very 2 brief questions. The first one is about your drop -- year-over-year drop of your net income. Could you please give us the specific reasons for the drop, the 7.6% drop in the net income? And the second question is about your outlook on the mobile sales in year 2. So you said it will be the main driver of your revenue growth. I was wondering will that be overall increase of the shipment of the mobile that you're thinking about? Or is there any other reason such as the technology upgrades over there? That's all. First question, of course, to explain what the reason behind the year-over-year drop of our net income in this year, I guess, for our second quarter. The second question is the outlook for mobile, the growth that we indicated, was it because it was driven by a quantity increase? Or is it because of technology migration, so leading to a revenue increase? Let me answer the first question. On year-over-year basis, if we look at the second quarter this year and the second quarter last year, the margin difference is mainly -- there's about 5 percentage points margin difference mainly from the lower utilization this year. This -- first half of this year has been very weak, including the second quarter. So utilization is the main reason and a little bit of product mix as well, okay? What is the second question? The second question is smartphone revenue increase. Yes. Smartphone revenue increase, whether it's quantity or technology migration. ;
The second half's revenue increase due to the smartphone firstly because of seasonality, of course. So that's -- as compared with the first half, second half, the smartphone is much better. Although we say that the whole year in the smartphone unit, we forecast a drop. But TSMC's revenues still grow because of, one, it's because of a silicon content increase. Second one is because we're getting the market share through our customer. So we still forecast the whole year, the smartphone will increase in revenue. Especially, the second half would be much stronger than the first half. Did that answer the question? Yes. Great. Next question is from [ Huo Bhao Wa ] from [ Taiping ] Securities. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, we can. Hello? We can hear you. Okay. Can I speak Chinese, please? Yes, you can speak Chinese. Okay. [Foreign Language] Let me translate to English first. [ Huo Bhao ] had observed our June revenue, which is a strong growth, and he want us to comment on the second half business outlook. [Foreign Language] Lora, can you speak in English too, for the record? All right. I just gave the guidance for the third quarter, where our revenue in third quarter will be USD 9.1 billion to USD 9.2 billion. That is 18% sequential growth. As to the fourth quarter, we have said we believe our fourth quarter revenue will be higher than third quarter although there are still some uncertainties. We did not provide a clear guidance on the fourth quarter yet. Okay. [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] Okay. So your first question is -- he likes to know the breakdown among our smartphones, HPC and IoT and on our growth platforms, the revenue breakdown. [Foreign Language] I will now provide a revenue breakdown by platform for the whole year. But I have just said, our smartphone will grow single digit. It still accounts for the biggest part of our revenue for the whole year followed by HPC. And then the rest of them are much smaller, like IoT, automotive and DCE and others. We have another question from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Just one quick follow-up. But before I just -- I also want to express my gratitude to Lora Ho and wish her the best of luck in her new endeavor.
Going back to a question that came up last earnings conference call. It had to do with the SOI. And I just wanted to revisit the topic and better understand how you're planning for some of the challenges that 5G brings, such as a lower, I think, you said power consumption and whether SOI is going to be included in your road map. Well, we develop some of the technology for the RF circuit or RF technology using the SOI wafers. But we don't do the logic technology on FD-SOI. So let me make sure that everybody understands what I'm going to deliver. We don't do FD-SOI or logic -- or conventional logic technology, but we do use SOI wafer to develop RF technologies. For RF Front End, for example, that we are doing. Did I answer the questions? Yes, you have. Got it. Yes. All right. Let's come back to the floor. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. I have 2 follow-up questions, and if I may, I may have some industry questions. So first of all, it's about the smartphone sili content increase. Can you give us some color how much is that for this year? And also when 5G comes next year, because your remark was just very bullish about the 5G smartphone contribution next year. How would the 5G smartphone to help on your sili content growth in the smartphones? Okay. That's a good question, but it's very hard to identify what is the percentage of the silicon content increase. But let me give you some color a bit, all right? The first one is -- look at your smartphone today. It's 3-camera or 2-camera or even 4-camera. Look at that. And look at the pixel size, right? You might hear some of the pixel is a 48-megapixel. Lots of cameras come with silicon with it. So that's the silicon content, the first one. Actually, just some other minor things, so for example, power management IC. Now the power consumption is very important. So now every major component inside need the power management IC to come with it. One is screen driver. You need power management. The application process, you need power management. Just a lot of things.
And furthermore, let me give you in terms of 5G. You have a lot of different channels. So now even the RF transceiver or RF Front End, the die size is bigger. That's why I say -- that's why silicon content is increasing. Did I answer your question?
But how many percentage, actually, I cannot identify it. But how significant is for those modern chip or application process? Because that's related to your businesses the most. Can you give us some percentage of increase? Like 10%, 20% increase? Definitely cannot. I cannot because we are working on it and we know all the minor details. So I cannot give that -- some of the information. Okay. That's fine. So next question, switching gears back to the gross margin, right? So we -- so my question is that for your leading-edge investment, do you feel like the payback period of those leading-edge investments are getting longer or shorter, right? Because I still want to find out some explanation why gross margin kind of declined year-over-year. So it could the leading-edge investments getting heavier, or there's a true price competition from your competitors. So I just want to get some thoughts from you on this topic. Lora, can give an idea on the payback years? Okay. I looked -- actually, personally, I don't a payback year means much. If you look at the various technologies -- actually, I checked this question. They look very much the same. We all know the payback year are very much the same. However, I think the ramp profile is very different and the sensitivity of utilization to margin is different. The more leading-edge is more sensitive to margin. So leading edge needs to have very high utilization to secure the margin. That's the key, and we are working on it, okay? Okay. And to -- since I wanted to cross-check, if I may. First of all, you mentioned that you're pulling some 5-nanometer CapEx to this year, right? So next year, do you think the CapEx level would be at the range of your kind of annual guidance? And secondly, about the wafer products, do you think you can get a good bargain on the raw wafer price for next year? I think next year's CapEx will have to depend on a lot of things: depend on overall market conditions, the customers' requirements and so forth. So it's probably too early to say whether it's going back to this old range or target. As we get more clear, we will communicate with you, okay? The raw wafer price, I think we have done a good job to lock in the price, and that is also a continued effort. I think to make sure you understand, Lora just mentioned it will exceed the top range, what we gave you today. All right. Follow-up question will be coming from CL Securities' Sebastian Hou. I have 2 follow-ups. The first one is, for the past several earnings call, I always felt like TSMC's 5-nanometer tapeout activity or interest level from clients isn't as large as 7-nanometer at the same stage, if I -- well, if I'm right. Now you mention stronger 5-nanometer demand. And is it driven -- more driven by the auxiliary 5G deployment or also driven by the EUV costs or EUV economy improvements? It's actually driven by the 5G's accelerations. Okay. And internally, of 5G acceleration, do you see them more from HPC or smartphone? Both actually. Because our 5G infrastructure is in the HPC area. On the smartphone, almost all the premium phone is with TSMC. Okay. If I understand that correctly, I think so far, in most of the infrastructure baseband, 5G baseband is still on 12- or 16-nanometers, the mainstream right now. And so you see the accelerated 5-nanometer demand. So basically, we will assume that the next uptick will be 7 and I also see 5? Oh, I see. I see. You are talking about that. Some of the networking process will probably go into the 5-nanometer, but some of it stay in 7 and some of them -- but basically and virtually, both of the base station is now going to the most leading-edge technology. I think it is -- of course, in terms of revenue in smartphones, it's bigger than the base station, okay? And in the 5-nanometer, the big players get into 5G smartphone very aggressively. And it doesn't take many tapeouts, just a few tapeouts. The demand out is there of much bigger capacity than any other products. Second follow-up is I'd like to hear TSMC's views on the next-generation architecture of transistor. So how do you see the FinFET and the gate-all-around or to compare that to see the pros and cons of these 2 architecture in 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer? Because it seems that one of your competitors is -- promote GAA aggressively. Yes, we noticed that. And the answer that we also have evaluated all the options, right, just as what I said. And we do get the pros and cons. And we walk with our customer, and we choose the most competitive in terms of performance and cost-wise. So we choose the most of competitive approaches. So we walk with our customers, actually, closely. Okay. But would it make sense to assume that -- because so far, on the, say, 16-nanometer to 10, to 7, the industry standard has been FinFET. So customers will be easier to dual-source if they want to or if they can. But going -- if going forward, if there is going to be different routes, one doing GAA, one doing FinFET, would it be -- make customers, those who are seeing, more difficult? Actually, let me say that even the FinFET structure, it's very hard to switch the foundry. It's very hard because of the design board, the architecture, the design flow are all different. The 5-nanometer are geometry. TSMC still see the FinFET as the best of one, although we have embodied all other options. But so far, we still -- in 5-nanometer geometry, please notice that 5-nanometer geometries, FinFET is still the most efficient one, the most competitive one. For the [ full ] node transition to the next ones, 3-nanometer, we are evaluating everything. We talked with our customer when we want to find what is the approaches that we are using. So I think we can conclude our Q&A session now knowing that we had evaluated all available options and picked the optimal one.
Okay. Before we end today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 4 hours from now. Transcript will be available 24 hours from now. Both of which will be available through our website at www.tsmc.com.

So please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the microphone to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Elizabeth. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the third quarter followed by the guidance for the current quarter.
Third quarter revenue increased 21.6% quarter-over-quarter to TWD 293 billion, driven by new product launches, both in premium cellphone and high-performance computing applications using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology.
Gross margin increased by 4.6 percentage points sequentially to 47.6%, mainly due to a solid improvement in capacity utilization.
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.7% of net revenue compared to 11.2% in the second quarter due to better operating leverage.
Operating margin increased by 5.1 percentage points sequentially to 36.8%.
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 3.9 and ROE was 25.7%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer technology saw very strong demand and accounted for 27% of wafer revenue in the third quarter. 10-nanometer was 2% and 16-nanometer was 22%.
Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by platform. All 4 of our growth platforms saw demand increases in the third quarter. Smartphone increased 33% quarter-over-quarter to account for 49% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 10% to account for 29%. IoT increased 35% to account for 9%. And automotive increased 20% to account for 4%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 585 billion, a decrease of TWD 180 billion from the second quarter, mainly as we distributed TWD 207 billion of cash dividends for 2018.
On the liabilities side. Current liabilities decreased by TWD 127 billion quarter-over-quarter as we distributed 2018 cash dividend and accrued another TWD 65 billion or TWD 2.5 per share for the second quarter 2019 cash dividend and that will be paid in January of next year.
On financial ratios. Accounts receivables turnover days decreased 1 day to 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 11 days to 65 days, reflecting higher wafer shipments during the quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 142 billion of cash from operations, spent TWD 98 billion in capital expenditures and distributed TWD 207 billion of cash dividend. As a result, our overall cash balance decreased by TWD 197 billion to TWD 452 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures was $3.14 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 10.2 billion and USD 10.3 billion, which is a 9% sequential increase at the midpoint.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.6, gross margin is expected to be between 48% and 50%. Operating margin is expected to be between 37% and 39%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Let me follow by making a few comments about 2019 capital expenditures and TSMC's long-term financial objectives.
I will first talk about our capital budget for this year. In TSMC, we build capacity according to our customers' demand. To forecast such demand, we take into consideration, not only from each individual customer's indication, but also our own forecast based on macro as well as market segment outlook. Given the stronger outlook for 5G deployment next year, the demand for our 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer has increased significantly in the last few months.
We have, therefore, decided to raise our full year 2019 CapEx by USD 4 billion to meet this increased demand. We now expect our 2019 CapEx to be between USD 14 billion and USD 15 billion. About USD 1.5 billion of the USD 4 billion CapEx increase is for 7-nanometer capacity and $2.5 billion is for 5-nanometer capacity.
Although we're not able to give you a formal guidance for our next year's CapEx until next January, we currently plan next year's CapEx to be somewhat similar to our revised 2019 CapEx.
Now let me state our long-term financial objectives. As the company's new CFO, I'm happy to tell you that TSMC's long-term financial objectives remain the same. Our goal is to achieve revenue and net income CAGR in the next few years to be between 5% and 10% in U.S. dollar terms, gross margin to be about 50%, operating margin to be [ about ] 39% and ROE to be above 20%.
Regarding our cash dividend policy. We reiterate that we will distribute about 70% of free cash flow as cash dividend. More importantly, TSMC is committed to a sustainable cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis.
Now I will turn the microphone to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand and inventory.
We conclude our third quarter, just reported by CFO, with revenue of TWD 293 billion or USD 9.4 billion, that is slightly above our guidance due to better demand from smartphone-related applications in our forecast 3 months ago.
Moving into fourth quarter this year, we expect demand from both smartphone and high-performance computing-related applications will continue to increase, thanks to our industry-leading 7-nanometer technology that powers these applications.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory is being gradually [ digested ] throughout the third quarter. We now expect it will reduce to a few days above seasonal level exceeding third quarter and approach seasonal level by the end of this year.
For the full year of 2019, we forecast both the overall semiconductor market [ excluding ] memory and the foundry segment to decline by a low single-digit from the year 2018 level. However, we continue to expect TSMC to do better and achieve a slight annual growth.
Now let me talk about the progress and development of 5G. 5G will drive AI applications and bring many benefits to the market. Performance will be greatly improved with data transmission speed up to 10x faster as compared to 4G network. In addition, 5G latency will have about a 90% reduction as compared to 4G, allowing for real-time response and control. The benefit from 5G will unlock new use cases such as AR, VR, real-time translation and high-quality gaming, to name a few. We believe smartphone OEMs will come out with many more innovative application to take advantage of the 5G infrastructure.
Since the middle of this year, we have been seeing an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This will speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network and smartphone in several major market around the world, which leads to the increase of our CapEx for this year. We expect a faster ramp of 5G smartphones as compared to 4G with the penetration rate of 5G smartphones to reach mid-teens percentage of the total smartphone market in 2020.
Meanwhile, we expect the silicon content of 5G smartphones will be substantially higher than that of 4G smartphones. That is due to increasing functionalities and additional ICs for more camera, RF circuit, modem, power management IC, et cetera.
Power efficient, speed and ability to incorporate additional functionality are critically important to 5G smartphones, which require TSMC's leading-edge technology and will continue to fuel our growth for the next several years.
Now I will talk about our N5 and N3 status. Our N5 technology has already entered risk production with good yield. The N5 will adopt the EUV extensively and is well on track for volume production in the first half of next year. With 80%, 8-0, logic density gain and about a 20% speed gain compared with the 7-nanometer, our N5 technology is a true full node [ straight ] from our N7. We believe it will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best density, performance and power until our 3-nanometer arrives.
With N5, we are further expanding our customer product portfolio and increasing our addressable market. The initial ramp will be driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We are confident that 5-nanometer will have a strong ramp and be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about the N3. We are working with customers on N3 and the technology development progress is going well. Our N3 will be another full node from our N5 with speedier gain similar to the gain from N7 to N5. We expect our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced.
Now I will talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6. Today, we are completing our second year ramp of N7. We continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile HPC and IoT applications. Our N7+ is industry's first commercially available EUV lithography technology.
N7+ provides 15% to 20% higher density with improved power consumption when compared to N7 and is already in high volume production with yields similar to N7. We expect the strong demand for N7+ continue into next year and are increasing CapEx to meet this demand for multiple customers.
Now N6. Our N6 provides a clear migration path for the second-wave N7 product [ activities ] and rollout 100% compatible with N7 while providing 18% logic density gain with performance-to-cost advantage. The N6 uses 1 more EUV layer than N7+. N6 risk production is scheduled to begin in first quarter next year with volume production starting before the end of 2020.
We reaffirm that 7-nanometer will contribute more than 25% of our wafer revenue in 2019 and we expect even higher percentage in 2020 due to worldwide development of 5G accelerates while demand from HPC, mobile and other applications continue to grow.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's advanced packaging business. Our advanced packaging solutions and network system integration with wafer network process allowing seamless integration of front-end wafer process and back-end chip packaging. The solution consists of CoWoS, InFO, System on Integrated Chips or SoIC and the Wafer on Wafer or WoW. We are seeing strong momentum for CoWoS and InFO for HPC applications as we continue to enlarge the integrated chip area to about -- to above 2 reticle size in 1 module.
We are also working with a few leading customer on SoIC, which is an industry-leading 3D-IC packaging solution. SoIC enables 3D integration of multiple chips in close proximity to deliver the best possible performance, power and form factor. We target to start production in 2021 time frame with early adoption by HPC applications.
As our industry continues to seek innovation to enhance system-level performance, TSMC's differentiating advanced packaging solution will allow us to grow the business at a pace faster than corporate in the next few years. And thank you for your attention. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to limit your questions to 2 at a time to allow all participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Questions will be taken both from the floor and from the call. Should you wish to raise your questions in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Now we begin. First, we will have questions coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. Good results and outlook. Wanted to ask the first question given the high CapEx for this year and next year, if you could talk about the capital requirements for 5-nanometer in EUV. Maybe how the equation with EUV coming in, how does that affect the capital intensity, or say, the CapEx per 1,000 wafers? And how do you see this node in terms of pricing and maintaining the same level of profitability on prior nodes? Okay. So Randy, you're asking about the -- how much EUV accounts for the capital expenditures? Or how EUV changes your capital intensity or CapEx per 1,000. If you're getting some benefits that it's actually lowering that. But given that CapEx is still the same, you're seeing the higher CapEx per 1,000? And then how does that translate into profitability? How you expect 5 to compare to, say, some of the prior nodes? Well, I cannot talk too much about details. But definitely, CapEx per 1,000 for 5 is certainly higher than previous nodes. However, if we combined everything together, as we stated at the beginning, we're still seeing our profit -- structure profitability remains the same. Okay. I'll ask one follow-up to that and then a second question. I guess this year, like second half strong demand, leading-edge [ type ], the gross margin guidance for fourth quarter is still -- it's a good margin, but it's 48% to 50%, and I think the target's going to hit 50%. So maybe if there's still a little bit of drag on the margin?
And with next year bringing in a new node 5, if you think you can get to that 50% for next year. That's just a follow-up. Okay. For the fourth quarter, it's just like we stated all along for our structural profitability. When we reach 90% of utilization, we target to reach 50% of gross margins.
For next year, it's still early to say, but structural profitability -- profitability or margins may be affected by the ramp in a 5-nanometer as at the beginning of ramping of every nano -- technology nodes, it will somehow be affected. However, if the utilization is good, then we're still expecting to see that structural profitability continues. Okay. The second question I wanted to ask, because you had a strong third quarter recovery, guiding another good fourth quarter, as you look to maybe an early look at next year, how should we think about seasonality? There's some concerns before 5G ramps we have a correction on 4G. And then we have if the tariffs hit, we might have had some [ prebuild ]. So how do you see kind of early year risk of, say, a correction? And can you pull in some demand, say if capacity's tight, to maybe mitigate the magnitude of correction early in the year? You're talking about the seasonality of smartphone, that we observe almost every year, and so I don't expect next year to be dramatically different. However, we did see some of the 5G smartphones, the gross momentum is higher than we expected. So I would expect next year's seasonality is not so strong as we observed for this year. But it's too early to say because the market is very dynamic. Next question will be coming from JPMorgan's Gokul Hariharan. So first of all, if we look at the history, whenever TSMC has had a step-up in CapEx, that is typically accompanied by a step-up in growth as well. So just wanted to kind of narrow down a little bit on the 5% to 10% growth, which is still kind of -- the kind of growth that we were expecting when we were spending TWD 10 billion to TWD 11 billion. So could you give a little bit more details or maybe narrow down the forecast a little bit more for us? Because if we say a TWD 14 billion to TWD 15 billion range of CapEx, that's closer to the high 30s, 40% CapEx [ in the vicinity ], higher than our previous range. Gokul, let me answer the question carefully. Let's say that TSMC always build capacity, working closely with customer and to meet their demand. That's our number one, okay? We discuss with the customer on their demand, we make our judgment also. Now we are increasing the CapEx quite a lot, no doubt about it. But then, that's due to some of the reasons I can foresee for the future. First, the 5G's ramp-up is much faster than 4G as we expected. Second, TSMC actually is expanding our customer portfolio, and in the same time, we're also expanding our product portfolio. And so put all the factors together, we have a good reason that we increase our CapEx this year and probably next year. Okay. So that basically suggests that 5% to 10% is not the growth for the next couple of years. But maybe just given the higher growth in 5G and accelerated build-out, could you talk a little bit about going into next year, do you expect 5G and smartphone to be the main growth driver? Or do you feel that HPC momentum is going to be even faster than smartphone given that some of your customers are starting to take a lot of market share? To answer your question, actually it's both. We expect the smartphone to grow faster than -- I mean that's not in terms of units, but in terms of silicon content. And the HPC also grow, as I said, we are expanding our product portfolio and also our customer portfolio. So the addressable market is increased. That's all. Okay. So just a follow-up question. I think at the beginning of the year, we had a more conservative view on 5-nanometer build-out. Obviously, that view has changed. So just to calibrate, should we expect now that 5-nanometer revenues next year are likely to be higher than, let's say, 7-nanometer last year, first year of ramp of 7-nanometer? I don't want to say exactly what is the percentage. But let me say that now we have more optimistic than 6 months ago. 6 months ago, I believed what I said is that we will be very careful and a little bit conservative in building the 5-nanometer capacity. Now we changed to be more aggressive in the 5-nanometer capacity buildup because of we -- as I said, we work closely with customers in both our -- all the application like the smartphone, HPC, now even IoT and automotive. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. First of all, Mr. Huang, congrats on the new post and looking forward to working with you. Going back to CapEx, given the big increase, can you give us some guidance for modeling depreciation? Depreciation for this year will be flattish compared with last year because a big chunk of the increase happens in the fourth quarter.
As to depreciation next year, based on what I just indicated about our capital expenditures for next year, it will be higher. However, the detailed number or more specifics, we plan to discuss it in January next year. So if I look at when the new capacity is going to come online, is it mostly, say, Q2, Q3? Is that the right way to think about it? Well, if you look at towards the time, your estimate is very good. Q2, Q3 time. Okay. Great. Dr. Wei, for 7-nanometers, obviously demand looks quite good. Can you give us some guidance for 7-nano as a percentage of revenues by end of next year? Higher than this year. Next question will be coming from Citigroup's Roland Shu. First, congrats for the very good result in 3Q. And I think our first question is you talk about next year for 5G smartphone will be the key growth driver. So also you talk about not only because of unit growth, but also for the semiconductor content increase. So do you have the number for the entire content per 5G smartphone compared to your 4G? Let the CFO to answer this. The answer is we don't have that number. But if you compare -- compared to the 4G, where does the increase come from? Is it because from this bigger die size or because of more semiconductor silicon? Or I think you probably have an assessment on that, right? We do have some assessment, to be frank with you, because we know the die size, we know that the number of the chips inside. I give you some of the [ feed-in ]. We are using the more advanced technologies so the die size increase and the leading edge is not so much, but it did increase because of more functionality, you can expect that people put the AI application inside or those kind of thing.
More important, as the last time I believe I already mentioned that camera, for one example, now you can see more and more camera in smartphone, especially the high-end smartphone. And also the more resolution, the other one was [ silicon's real estate to ] -- from 12, what is that, 20 megapixel to 40 megapixel. So more camera, higher resolution, more pixel. And then also you need a lot of power management IC to control the power consumption because of 5G, they consume a lot of power. So your power management IC has to be more advanced, so you put more power management IC inside.
And then you are talking about more channel in the communication, so the RF front end, the transceiver, everything, you have not only the die size for an increase actually to adopt the more channel. So it's even -- move into that higher leading-edge technology also. So I guess for the high-end phone, probably -- well the [ final ] content will increase more, right? So for your -- the total 5G smartphone you made forecast to be about mid-teens of the total shipment. So do you have this 5G smartphone breakdown by high end, mid and low end? We'll talk about it in January. Okay. My second question is now we are ramping up N7+ [ fastly ]. So is N7+ gross margin going to be very different from N7 we are enjoying now? It's very close. Okay. And how about for N7+, is this going to take 7 to 8 quarters to bring up the gross margin to corporate average? Let me take that. We look at 7, 7+ and 10 as the big nodes. So from that point of view, N7 nodes actually has reached corporate margins. Okay. I think just a follow-up. So, I know you don't comment on the ASP, but for the same amount of the wafer shipment on N7+, is this going to contribute more revenue upside to TSMC? You just mentioned we don't... No, I talk about revenue. I don't talk about ASP. That's the same thing. Next question will be coming from CLSA's Sebastian Hou. My first question is to -- I want to ask about the CapEx intensity. So with the hike in this year CapEx, so apparently we can do the math that this [ CapEx ] to sales will go up to -- to shoot over 40% this year. So how do you see this trend into 2020?
And then is there any updated guidance on the CapEx intensity going forward versus prior guidance? Okay. Yes. As you just mentioned, you can calculate the CapEx intensity this year will be over 40%. At the same time, as we indicated that next year's CapEx, although preliminary, is about the same level as this year and we also see strong demand for our business next year, our CapEx intensity will be lower next year. And -- but from what we can see at this moment, it will then gradually come down to probably between 30% or 35% level going in -- after next year. So we are not seeing going to 30% to 35% range in 2020 yet? In a couple of years after 2020. But could potentially next year? You just -- you don't want to talk about that right now? Right. The potential of capital intensity, you mean? [ In other words ], you meet 30s by 2020? Well, it's lower than 40%. Okay. Second question is on the gross profit margin. I recall that a couple of quarters or 2 quarters ago in the first half this year when TSMC [ powered a ] table saying that we are past the bottom, we are seeing the strong rebound in second half this year and also expect the gross margin will go back to 50% level second half. And indeed, now we see the utilization rate coming at -- coming back, revenue coming back in second half as expected. But it looks like the gross margin is lagging a little bit compared to if you -- yes, compared to the revenue direction. So can you explain what's these factors that's driving gross margin recovery behind the revenue recovery? Yes, I think you're talking about the third quarter gross margins. Whenever there's a big jump up in utilization quarter-over-quarter, there will be a negative hit on gross margins. It's called the inventory revaluation. I think -- I believe we mentioned about this some time ago. So yes, as you can imagine, the utilization in the third quarter is much higher than that in the second quarter. And therefore, there is a element of negative inventory valuation happen in the third quarter. The amount is slightly over 1 percentage point, okay? Now if utilization remains at similar level, that factor will not happen. Okay. But when we're looking at the fourth quarter gross margin guidance, I know the high end will reach the 50%. But it still looks like the -- it's ranging between the 48% to 50%. So I mean there is still a chance for coming to go back to 50%, but it looks like the midpoint doesn't reach that yet. So I think not just about 3Q, but also the fourth quarter. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, I -- our structure profitability remains the same, i.e., if we reach 90% of utilization, we are targeting 50% of gross margins. Next question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. Congratulations for very good, strong results. So sorry to keep coming back to this question. So it seems you are raising kind of a long-term CapEx outlook including next year. Why don't you just revise up your revenue CAGR assumption? I think 5% to 10% revenue to be too conservative. Can you comment on that perhaps? It's not about time to change that target. I would say still 5% to 10%, but it's in the upper side, okay, I can say, all right? Yes. And in other words, on this capital intensity question is about the payback period, right? Because for me I still cannot add up why your structural profitability can remain the same whereas your capital intensity increased so much, right? So in another way, can you just comment about the payback period for your 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer investment you said becoming longer going forward? I remember this topic was discussed the last time and I think our answer was that we don't look at payback period. We do look at return of invested capital. And from that part, we don't see that big a difference with the advanced technologies. Okay. And my next question is about the advanced packaging. I remember in the previous quarters, you commented advanced packaging should outgrow the front-end business. So first of all, is this remains the same trend? And also how about the potential margin dilution from the packaging business? The forecast on the advanced packaging business, the gross is -- the gross rate is still faster than the silicon gross rate. The wafer's revenues gross rate, it stays the same, okay? Still that statement is still valid.
The gross margin, that's another consideration. The gross margin of the back-end business actually is lower today, still lower than the wafer margin. And -- but we look at it whether it's a good business to go or not on 2 factors. One, we really want to support our customer to improve their system performance. So we have to do it because of TSMC is the only one company right now who can support customers' advanced packaging. Second actually is the CapEx intensity on the back end, and that's the advanced packaging business is smaller. And so the [ handset ] turnover is better. So put all in all together, we still think it's a very good business to pursue. Yes. And last one, this is a quick one maybe for CFO. Because you revised out your CapEx, right, so what is the free cash flow trend in the coming quarters? I guess we want to know potential -- the next potential quarterly dividend hike. What would be the timing? Let me just answer it by saying that we will not lower our dividends quarter-on-quarter basis. So investor will get at least the same amount, if not more, compared to previous quarter or compared to previous year. Okay. How about the base, I mean, the free cash flow projection? Do you have the number for coming quarters? Yes. We do. But I don't think that really matters to your questions. If I may, I would like to remind Charlie that today, all our shareholders are getting the $2 per share dividends today going into their bank account. And we have already announced that the next quarter -- quarterly dividend is going to be $2.50. So it has already gone up.
Next question will be coming from Goldman Sachs, Bruce Lu. Can I ask, what is your 5G penetration forecast about 6 months ago? 5G smartphone penetration forecast 6 months ago. Six months ago, we don't think the 5G smartphone will be any significant amount for this year. And so... No. I mean, 6 months ago, what's your forecast for 5G smartphone shipment in 2020? Oh, single digit. So basically, increase from single digit to mid-teens? Mid-teens. Yes. For the past 6 months? Yes. Can you tell us what is the rationale behind your changes? Because for the past 6 months, we still have a lot of concern for the 5G smartphone such as -- and they say that the specs not finalized, the cost structure is getting a lot higher, global telcos they are not as aggressive. So can you -- because from single-digit to mid-teens, which is the big changes. Right. It's a big change. And all I can say is whether it's NSA, SA or those kind of 5G's base station installation, we work with our customer. Actually, we listen to them. And they also have their own customer to consider. And so some of the areas in the [ world ],they accelerated 5G's deployment and that's why its result as compared with 6 months ago, we did not see this momentum. But then in these 6 months, the momentum has grown bigger and bigger and so that's why we -- I cannot give you the specific number of which country or which region, but we can see the momentum continue to grow. And now our own estimate has almost doubled. But the concern is still there from a lot of investors, such as the NSA because you still cannot see the clear indication from -- at the end of the day, from the telcos, right? So that's why we are a bit surprised to see these kind of meaningful changes, right? Yes, I have no way to comment on the carrier how they think about this kind of 5G deployment. But they are moving ahead and -- for the 5G applications, especially some of the big countries. That's what we see. Okay. My next question is that we always rely on management to comment about the fabless inventories. I mean you always talk about that. But moving forward, your top 2 customer, it might account for 30%, 40% of your business pretty soon. And they might account for 70%, 80% of your advanced geometry and they don't really report their inventory anyway. So how -- can you give us something -- some other indicator for us to judge the industry growth or judge the inventory level for the industry? Judge for the industry level, we -- the fabless company is still one of the big factor that we consider. As former customer actually for TSMC more importantly, we really work with our customer closely, so I'm not going to give you the exact number of my big customers' inventory, but we work with them. Believe me, we very closely work together so we understand that -- their strategy and their inventory. That's why I wanted you to give us some hint, right? We cannot just tell my investor that we have to trust TSMC. Even though I say that all the time but... You can trust TSMC. No doubt about it. All right. I think this is probably about the right time that we go to the lines for questions. I think there are quite a few analysts waiting on the line for questions. So operator, could you please go to the first person on the line? Thank you. Yes. We have questions from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I have a question really on China. I guess in the last couple of years, we've seen your business double with Chinese customers. And I guess at the moment, it's pretty clear you're going through a very healthy inflection point with Chinese customers at the moment. So can you talk about how you see this part of the business evolving over the next 1 or 2 years?
And then I guess from a planning perspective, are you concerned that the rise of your China business comes at the sacrifice of other customers, particularly U.S. companies? Can you repeat the question? Brett, your question is with respect to the business we derive from China as you have observed that our business has doubled in the last couple of years from China. And you would like to see the outlook for our business in China in the next 1 to 2 years. And also the strong growth coming from China, whether it is coming at the expense of our other customers in other regions. Well, we did see the strong course from China because that's a very big market, especially in the semiconductor area. And we are happy to see that growth, and TSMC is offering the most leading-edge technology to support our customer in China. And so to be exact, we are going to grow with the China market. At the expense of other customer, the answer is no because we support all the customer with all our strength and our capacity. Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on 5-nanometer specifically. I guess maybe you can talk about whether you think the ramp of 5-nanometer will be similar to prior nodes [ in virtual ] terms or revenue. How should we think about the ramp-up, particularly as you get through into the second half of 2020?
And on your CapEx increase, I think you've said in the past you want to -- you plan to grow -- you've been quite consistent, you want to grow your top line 5% to 10%, but your capital intensity to support that growth would be around about 30 or maybe low 40s as a percent of sales. Now you're stepping up your capital intensity significantly, but you're not changing your growth outlook. Can you perhaps just explain the thinking there? So first part of the question is with respect to 5-nanometer ramp, whether the ramp profile next year will be similar to our prior nodes' ramp profile.
The second question is related to the substantial increase in the CapEx. Because in the past, TSMC has indeed said that we could have $10 billion to $12 billion CapEx to support a 5% to 10% CAGR. Now our CapEx is substantially higher than the $10 billion to $12 billion. And therefore, does that mean that it's going to support a much higher CAGR on the revenue growth? Well, let me answer the first question first, the 5-nanometer's ramp for next year. Certainly as compared with 6 months ago, we are right now is more aggressive and more optimistic about it. And hopefully, because we spend big money, hopefully, that it will ramp up much in terms of revenue, be much faster than 7-nanometer. In next January, we are going to talk about it more.
And so that also answers the second question, that we spend -- we increased the CapEx quite a lot, of course, from $10 billion to $11 billion to about $14 billion to $15 billion. With that money, we spend to buy the tools to prepare everything. We do expect that, of course, this will go beyond 5% to 10%. But right now, we are not ready to change that long-term 5-year's target yet. However, we are working on that. Operator, please go to the next caller on the line. Your question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. A couple of follow-ups. When you make a reference to 5G, how should we think about opportunities from the networking, specifically base station?
Thanks for the detailed color on the smartphone units, you expect a mid-teen penetration. But how would you quantify opportunities from the networking, specifically base station? And I have a couple of follow-ups. So Mehdi, your question is that although we have talked about 5G smartphone units for next year, but you would like for our management to talk about the 5G base station business next year. Actually, the networking is fundamental for the 5G's infrastructure. And because of its shorter wavelength, so that you can expect that the base station will be much more than 4G's base station under SA or even the -- for the NSA's implement. So we expect the networking process will be much higher. The opportunity will dramatically increase. What's the exact for the number, we don't have an exact number for right now. Is networking included in the HPC category? Yes. Okay. So the reason I ask this question is if your customers are building [ tandemly ] a 5G smartphone, could opportunities in networking actually help offset any downside risk to excess inventory built on a smartphone? I think, Mehdi, you are asking whether or not the increasing demand in the networking side will offset the higher inventory or the inventory correction on the smartphone side. Is that your question? Yes. If there is an inventory, I'm trying to understand how networking could offset any risk of inventory built. I did not catch what you say. The relation between the networking or the base stations are set up without the 5G smartphones inventory? Sorry, let me clarify. I think one of the concerns among the investment community is, yes, there is very strong build plans for the 5G smartphone, but the risk is these phones are too expensive and perhaps there is a risk that your customers' build plans are too aggressive. In that context, could opportunities on the networking side be large enough for TSMC to help alleviate any downside risk on the phone -- or excess inventory on the phone side? Oh, I see. Okay. Let me repeat your questions. You say that my customer are making the smartphone quite a large number. If the base station or networking did not catch up, is that smartphone going to be inventory? The answer is no because of the 5G's application will be implemented. And you bought a 5G smartphone, you still can use 4G's functionality, by the way. So it won't be a kind of inventory as you mentioned about it provided you have just not enough 5G's base station. So Mehdi, I think what C.C. is saying is that you don't have to worry too much about 5G smartphone inventory because there will be sufficient demand to take up those products. Yes. And then just a real quick follow-up. In the past, you have talked about advanced packaging accounting for high single digit of overall revenue in 2019 and that mix would grow into the teens in the next decade. Are those targets remain intact? Advanced packaging used to account for about high single-digit percent of TSMC's revenue. Mehdi's question is, will that continue to increase to maybe high teens of TSMC's revenue? It will continue to increase, but it's not a high teens. It's still the high single digit, but the growth rate is higher than the silicon wafer's growth rate. Okay. And is cryptocurrency stable? Should we be concerned that maybe some of this growth is driven by crypto? Or do you see crypto as pretty stable and could even be a downside risk? All right. You are talking about cryptocurrency's mining. We [ didn't ] see the Bitcoin's prices increase starting from this year until now. However, let me state the TSMC's policy and strategy. We will support cryptocurrency mining as a business with available capacity. That's all we say. We are not going to be add in more CapEx for that. Operator, could you please go to the next caller on the line? Your next question comes from the line of [ Tsang Hung ] from [indiscernible] I just wanted to understand, given the recent developments that are happening in Hong Kong and the elections that you're having in Taiwan next semester -- next calendar year, do you see that you might have to revisit the CapEx plan given the trade war and the intensity of the trade wars that are increasing? You think about the trade war between the 2 big countries, is that going to affect the TSMC's CapEx plan? We... Yes, in terms of... In terms of Hong Kong situation or what do you think about it? Let me say again, TSMC builds capacity working closely with customer to meet customers' demand and our own judgment. We did not put that kind of trade tension in the world into consideration, although we think that any trade tension or trade war between any countries will have a negative impact to the semiconductor industry. Did I answer your question? Right. But I mean -- no so I totally believe it's [ either ] to assume that the election that comes in -- presidential election in January, if these things were to go towards the party that's in more favor of the one-state kind of thing, would that have an incremental impact in terms of how the trade war is seen from TSMC's perspective? No, we don't think so. Even we have general election in the next January, that won't affect TSMC's strategy. That will -- because of -- we can -- we do the business according to the demand, according to the market situation and have [ braided ] or impacted from the politics in Taiwan. Did I answer the question? [ Good to hear that ]. And sir, finally -- yes. Yes. Yes. To a large extent, yes. That was helpful.
And so one more thing, sir. In terms of the 5G CapEx that we have been talking about, so there have been -- on the high-speed HPC segment, there have been delays in terms of the [ next ] node coming through from your large customers. When you see that your 5G rollout moving pretty strong and also on the HPC side, things pick up strongly, is there any indication from your customers that the launch on the next node is going to be pretty soon? What gives us visibility here? Let me try to see if I understand your question. You are asking us about the visibility of our customers' demand for our next node technology, how much visibility we have with respect to seeing the demand from them for the next node. Right. Next node, you're mentioning about 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer? 5-nanometer. 5-nanometer for now. Let's say 5-nanometer. Judging from we increased the CapEx for the 5-nanometer, you know our position and you know our forecast on the 5-nanometer's business. So it will be good. And I cannot tell you how many percentage more, but I think the 5-nanometer, TSMC is going to do a very good job and going to have a high market share. Operator, let's move to the next caller on the line. Your next question comes from the line of Xiuxi Zhu from S&P Global. I just have a brief question for -- on the China issue. I was wondering, is there any change in the numbers of your Chinese clients in recent years, especially in this year? And if it is possible that we can get a specific number of the Chinese customers or the percentage of the Chinese customers as of the total clients? The number of customers in China actually is more than 100. So it changes -- some of them changes all the time. Of course, there are some bigger ones and smaller ones. I'm not sure if this is your question. Yes. Sure. Just is there any change on this number in this year? The number of customers generally increases. It increases. And may we know the portion of the Chinese customers in terms of your overall customers or the percentage? Oh, you mean the revenue or number of customers? The number of customers. The number of customers. The number of customers. Oh, we have over 400 active customers globally. And if you look at the China, if it's somewhere over 100, that gives you an idea. Does that answer your question? Yes. Yes. Very helpful. Yes, that's all my questions. Okay. Thank you. Do we have any questions on the floor? Okay, let me come back to the floor.
First of all, we will have a follow-up question from Citigroup's Roland Shu. I would like to follow up on the inventory question. However, this is for your inventory. I look at in 3Q, your inventory level actually have been decreased to 97 billion even though we had a very strong revenue in 3Q and a very upbeat guidance in 4Q. So the wafer in process within the -- should increase. However, overall inventory decreased a lot. So does that mean that our finished goods and also even for our materials like the wafer, inventory has decreased a lot? And you are right. Actually, let me -- suppose that the process actually enlarged, the total inventory should increase, but it decreased. It's because of some of the wafer, we worked with our customer at the beginning of this year. We produce it in early stage to make sure that we don't have a wafer [ coated ] at the end of this year and then we ship it out. And so the inventory actually decreased quite a lot because of that. Means the finished goods? Yes, finished goods. Okay. Yes. How about for the wafers? I mean for the -- like raw wafer inventory. The raw wafer almost stays the same because we prepare -- TSMC's business is increasing. So actually, the raw wafer, we require a lot of amount in preparation for the good business. So it stays the same in terms of percentage -- in terms of days, I'm sorry. Okay. And for the very upbeat outlook next year for the 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer, are we securing all of these wafers for our production next year? You bet. Okay. And the second question is you announced that your EUV tools have been reached potentially maturity, but how about for the infrastructure? It means that for other component like photoresist, pellicle, photomask or even for this inspection to chemical and materials. So yes, we have -- going to have very fast ramp on 5-nanometer because of very strong demand from a customer, but are there any gating items for this EUV infrastructure will be potentially a risk? So far we, do not see any gating item. All the infrastructure, actually TSMC, we are prepared. We have a -- we produce our own pellicle. We have a large number of masking capacity and everything. So even photoresist, those kind of thing, we have been taking into account. So we are ready for the -- actually, we are in a high-volume production for the EUV lithography technology. For next year, you have big -- even higher volume, and I can assure you that we are all prepared. Next coming -- next question will be coming from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. Yes. I want to ask because you kind of hinted the utilization still below 90%. So to get to 50%, you need to get utilization up. Could you talk about the 28-node prospects, how you see that? And then also 16 and 12, some of the applications, like we move on, some of the mobile and graphics. So your view on utilization and backfill to hold up that technology node. Let me answer that question. On 28-nanometers, this technology node right now, I believe, in the industry is overcapacity. And so the utilization is very low, not to TSMC's expectation. So we prepare a lot of derivative technologies -- specialty technology, let me say that. And we expect 2 years later from now, at the -- again in the high utilization, but not today. It takes time to work with a customer and to utilize that capacity.
For 16 and 12-node, today we are still in a very healthy utilization, but we are prepared. And if our competitor is -- continue to increase the capacity just by a 28-nanometer's node, we expect a couple of years later, something like that, you have the overcapacity again. So right now, we are prepared all the specialty technology like RF, like even some of the ISP or something like that. So it won't happen to TSMC. Okay. The second question, just to ask about the segment revenue. I think into third quarter, mobile and HPC were both going to be strong. The HPC was good, but it wasn't quite as strong. So I'm curious just in that mix, maybe factors for HPC. And then IoT was quite strong. So maybe some of the things you're seeing in that. And then if you could extend to give an outlook for fourth quarter by segment. In the fourth quarter, of course, every segment is increased. The HPC itself consists a lot of different market segment that's including network processing, including GPU, including accelerator, including all the cryptocurrency mining. And we expect that HPC will grow significantly in the fourth quarter. Could you give the other segments? I guess do you -- so any lagging and any picking up strongly? Let me give you -- okay. Now IoT, this quarter -- the third quarter of the IoT increased quite a bit. So in the fourth quarter probably at the level of or slightly decrease. While all other segment will continue to grow. Next question will be coming from UBS, Bill Lu. Yes. If you look at the foundry industry historically, what we typically see is a big node followed by a smaller node, right? And now essentially what you're saying is a big 7 and a big 5. Can you maybe just discuss what you're seeing that is different now versus before? Clearly, TSMC is addressing new markets. I think the demand drivers are different now versus before. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing that is different now. You mentioned, yes, big and then followed by a small node. I don't really catch what you mean. But let me say that TSMC introduced a 16-nanometer and then 12 and then 10 and then 7 and then 5.
Now let's talk about 7 and 5. We are looking at the new market in the 5G because the 5G's requirement on the speed and the power consumption reduction is quite a lot. It's not the same experience that we have before. And so that after the 7-nanometer, all the customer asked us to develop the technology to meet their requirement with higher speed, lower power consumption. So it will be a full node kind of improvement. It's not, say, that's a 10% improvement will be good enough.
Now look at our 7-nanometer. We have a 7-nanometer, we have 5 and then we have a 6-nanometer. The 6-nanometer being introduced as kind of for second wave product. But the leading wave of a product are always at a full node and marching ahead with about a 2 years cadence than we expect. Next question will be coming from JPMorgan's Gokul. So if we compare the change in expectations in the last 6 months, would you characterize almost all of it as market growth -- faster market growth of 5G HPC? Or is there any meaningful change that -- in your market share expectation for some of your future nodes as well? Well, compared with 6 months ago, we are a little bit kind of conservative at the time because of our 7-nanometer's utilization is quite low. So we become conservative. But then in these 6 months, a lot of things changed. Let me say that, first, the 5G's momentum is larger than we expected. The second one is we also at the same time, because of our technology offer to the customer, we expand our customers' portfolio. And because of the performance, again, we also expand to new product portfolio. And so now we look at the future, we are more optimistic than 6 months ago, much more. Any increase in market that you expect compared to 6 months back? I cannot comment on that. But it will be increased, right? If you expect. Okay. Quickly on the breadth of customers on N5. I think around this time 1 year or 9 months before N7 ramp-up, you were talking about roughly I think 50 to 100 tape-outs on N7. Could we talk about what is the breadth of number of customers or number of tape-outs on N5 and how do you expect that to progress? And I know that number of tape-outs is not equal to the number of -- or revenue or wafer volume, but I just wanted to understand the breadth of the customer base. Well, let me say that, tape-out is one thing that see that how popular it is, but the more important is high volumes products at tape-out. And right now, we have many high-volume products at tape-out. And that is the main reason why we increase our CapEx, high volume. And also in addition to smartphone, there are more market segment that we enter [ at the end ]. Okay. Just one quick follow-up. If you think about N7 family, N7, N7+, N6, is it your expectation that pretty much most of the N7 current customers will eventually end up using N6, N7+? Will most of your capacity eventually be EUV-enabled for N7 as well? Or it will still be some EUV, some still using the current N7? We still expect some using the EUV and some will still stay in the N7. Because for those customer in the N7 [ quantum ], in the 2-year cadence, they moved to N5 already. So they have no reason to go back to use N6. However, as I said, for the second wave of the product, they're using N6 with the benefit of lower die cost and better performance. So we should expect eventually majority will be N6? Yes. Next follow-up question will be coming from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So first of all, I want to follow up Bill's question on the future technology. C.C., you mentioned that there are lots of benefit from power consumption from [ performers ] from 5-nanometer, et cetera. So how about the per transistor cost, right? I remember some of your customers talking about they don't see the benefit from the transistor cost-saving going forward. Do you think that is a true statement? I still believe the per transistor cost is decreasing because right now, geometry is smaller and smaller. Although for TSMC, we more pay attention to what customer need, right? Because if they need speed, we give them speed. If they need the power -- lower power consumption, we give them the lower power consumption. But higher density is always the one that we are moving into the next-generation technology. So transistor-wise, I did not do the very detailed calculation, but I still think the transistor as a cost is low. Okay. And you also mentioned that for those new tape-out, actually volume is quite big. Can I interpret it in another way? Meaning those smaller customers, they cannot really afford those future technology unless they have a very big volume. Is that the right thinking? Not really. I mean that depend on their product. Your last question about transistor as a cost, let me give you some kind of a taste. We improved the logic density by 80%, but I did not charge my customer 80% more. So you know that the transistor is lower. And again, in the market, I will say that a product to be successful is more important than you really calculate this improvement, this cost, that cost. Product has to be competitive in the market and so that people will give them the price that they deserve, okay? So now the small customer cannot afford it. Actually some of the small customer, they are working on the CPU kind of a performance. They need a very high performance technology that they are working with TSMC. Okay. And next is on EUV, all right? So over the past 3 years, there were some kind of challenge in terms of power, throughput, pellicle, et cetera. So now do you see any kind of new issues, new challenge for EUV? Or from now on it's like a blue sky? Okay. In TSMC, EUV lithography technology is now in the production stage. But are we happy with that? Not yet. We are still improving availability. We have output power of 250 watts, as we expected. Now we can operate the tool with 250 watts consistently. However, there's still something that we need to improve so that we can improve the throughput, we can improve the availability so we can reduce the cost, continue to improve. So in the interest of time, we will just have the last question that will be coming from CLSA's Sebastian Hou. I want to follow up. First one is I want to follow up on EUV. Because overnight, ASML seems to talk about some supply constraints on the EUV tool -- the new EUV tool. So it looks like this guidance -- preliminary expectation for next year EUV unit growth and this seems to be like amazing either. So I wonder what would that impact TSMC? And has TSMC secured what you need for this $14 billion to $15 billion CapEx this year or next year? The answer is yes, we secure whatever we need. We work with ASML very closely and we are ordering all the tools that we need. Okay. So which means that the supply constraints could affect someone else but not us more? I don't want to comment on that. Okay. My second question is that on the -- it looks like there's a CapEx step-up this year and next year. And when you think about that the -- in 28-nanometer also saw very strong demand, we continue to build the capacity, but then a couple of years later it turns into the underutilization, overcapacity, although there's some factors that because of the competition and laggards catching up. But how do you see this risk going forward for 7 and 5? And have you considered that whether there will be strong enough second wave or third wave of a demand to backfill this capacity when your current customers migrate into 3 or 2 or whatever it is 3 years from now? To answer your second question first, we do have confidence that a lot of product will fill up TSMC's capacity. Now a few years later, if you compare with the 28-nanometer to 7 to 5, it's not a good comparison because of 7 and 5 with the EUV, that technology barrier is much, much, much higher than you can expect to form the high-K metal gate. And so they are -- anyway, I don't want to comment on my competitor. Right. Okay. Just last one. It's the last one, I promise, the last one. The -- when we look at the CapEx step-up this time, it looks like the company has been staying around like $10 billion on the CapEx, plus/minus $1 billion to $2 billion for a few years right now. If we go back to look at in 2010, when we walked out of the downturn in 2009 and also we -- there's a huge step-up of your CapEx from 2010 to -- or 2009 to 2010, and then we know what happened to TSMC, it's a golden year for TSMC for a couple of years. So now we have another step-up out of the semi-downturn in the past 12 months. Do you think there's similarity now or there's been and when you make this bold CapEx decision this time? I know what you ask, but let me say that TSMC is getting smarter, definitely. And by the way, that technology barrier is much higher than -- as I said, much higher than 28-nanometer. So we have confidence that the capacity we built is closely -- is a result we closely work with our customer. And so we decided to increase the capacity at this time with a lot of detailed analysis. And I certainly -- I have confidence that we won't repeat the same kind of error that we did. Actually, not means error. I will say that, that was a very right and bold decision, capital increase in 2010. Oh, thank you. 2010? Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. Those are the 28-nanometer. It's the golden years. Very good, yes. Yes. So I was asking whether we could see another few of golden years after this. Oh, you say that for -- of course. What do you expect?
Yes. Well, before we conclude our conference, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to announce that -- important news that the beautiful lady sitting right beside me, Elizabeth, had decided to retire from the company at the end of this year. As you all know, Elizabeth has been with TSMC as Head of Investor Relations for 17 years. 17, that's a long time, isn't it? She's also the head of our public relations for 10 years. And well, the beautiful lady had been called in the public, say, the face of TSMC. TSMC is beautiful also.
In her IR role, Elizabeth has won numerous awards and recognitions all over the world, not -- as an IR -- the best IR Officer. That's in Taiwan, in Asia and in the world. So many of you had been in frequent contact with her, I believe, so you know that she is a brilliant and enthusiastic and energetic lady. And you can definitely sense how much she loves TSMC. In the last many years, she has built a world-class IR team and developed successfully a competent successor who is sitting right there.
On behalf of TSMC, I would like to thank her for all her dedication and contribution to the company's success and wish her the best for her retirement.
Now ladies and gentlemen, let's ask Elizabeth to give us a few words. Thank you, and thank you very much, C.C. I'm very privileged to have been able to work for TSMC in the last almost 17 years. Under the leadership of our Founder, Dr. Morris Chang, and the current management team, I have witnessed how this company is able to move from strength to strength and still remains true to its mission and its value. I have been blessed with the opportunity to represent this company that I deeply admire in front of the investment community and the press. I have enjoyed every minute of it, and I hope I have served the company well. You did. With all my heart to the investors, to the analysts and to the press, I want to thank you for your friendship and trust. I very much enjoyed our interactions, communications and discussions in the past. And I do hope that you will extend your goodwill to my IR successor, [ Jeff Su ], who has been working closely with me in the last 4 years, and many of you are already familiar with [ Jeff ].
I have had the most wonderful, exciting and rewarding time in my career at TSMC. I'm leaving the company at a time when its future is brighter than ever, and I'm confident that you will continue to derive handsome returns from owning our shares. So with that, let me wish you good fortune and good health, and we will conclude today's conference here. Thank you.

And now I would like to turn the microphone over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2019. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2020.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 8.3% sequentially to TWD 317 billion, driven by high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and HPC-related applications using TSMC's industry-leading 7-nanometer technology.
Gross margin increased 2.6 percentage points sequentially to 50.2%, thanks to a higher level of capacity utilization and continuous cost improvement, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expenses increased by TWD 3.6 billion, reflecting higher development activities for 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer as well as opening expenses in preparation for 5-nanometer ramp.
Operating margin increased by 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 39.2%.
Overall, our fourth quarter EPS reached TWD 4.47 and ROE was 28.9%.
Now let's take a look at revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology continued to ramp strongly and accounted for 35% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter; 10-nanometer was 1%; and 16-nanometer was 20%. Advanced technologies, defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 56% of wafer revenue, up from 51% in the third quarter.
On a full year basis, 7-nanometer contribution increased from 9% in 2018 to 27% of wafer revenue in 2019; 10-nanometer was 3%; and 16-nanometer was 20%. Advanced technologies accounted for 50% of total wafer revenue, up from 41% in 2018.
Now let's take a look at revenue contribution by platform. Our fourth quarter revenue growth was driven mainly by smartphone and HPC. Smartphone increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to account for 53% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC increased 6% to account for 29%. IoT decreased 4% to account for 8%. Automotive remained flat and accounted for 4%.
On a full year basis, smartphone and IoT led the growth with 12% and 33%, respectively, while HPC, automotive and DCE decreased 8%, 7% and 8%, respectively. If we exclude cryptocurrency from both years, HPC would have grown mid-single digit in 2019. Overall, smartphone accounted for 49% of our 2019 revenue; HPC, 30%; and IoT, 8%.
Moving onto the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 583 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 96 billion as we increased TWD 33 billion in short-term borrowings mainly for hedging purpose, TWD 51 billion in payables to suppliers and TWD 13 billion in dividends payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 41 days. Days of inventory decreased 10 days to 55 days due to higher wafer shipments during the quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 203 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 170 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 52 billion for first quarter '19 cash dividend. We also increased 33 -- TWD 36 billion in short-term loans for hedging purpose. Overall, our cash balance slightly increased TWD 3 billion to TWD 455 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures reached USD 5.6 billion and totaled USD 14.9 billion for the full year.
Now let's take a look at the recap of our performance in 2019. 2019 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry given the rising macroeconomic uncertainties and supply chain inventory correction, to name a few. However, we are able to grow our revenue by 1.3% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term and 3.7% in NT dollar term.
Gross margin decreased 2.3 percentage points to 46% primarily because of lower capacity utilization in the first half of the year. Operating margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 34.8%. Overall, full year EPS slightly declined 1.7% to TWD 13.32.
On cash flow, we spent TWD 460 billion in CapEx, while we generated TWD 615 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 155 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 259 billion in cash dividends, an increase of 25% from the previous year.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 10.2 billion and USD 10.3 billion, which represents a 1.4% sequential decrease at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 29.9, gross margin is expected to be between 48.5% and 50.5%; operating margin between 37.5% and 39.5%.
Now I will look -- I would like to make one more comment on tax rate. In the past, we needed to accrue tax on undistributed earnings, which trigger a much higher tax rate in the second quarter. Now, due to the tax regulation changes, we can offset the tax with our capital investments and no longer need to incur the tax expense on undistributed earnings.
Meanwhile, we are still subjected to the alternative minimum tax. As a result, we will still have a full year tax rate approximately 12%, and this will be equally applied to all 4 quarters of the year. This concludes my financial presentation.
Let me follow by making a few comments about near-term demand in inventory and 2020 capital budget. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 317.2 billion or USD 10.4 billion, slightly above our guidance, mainly due to better demand from smartphone-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago. Concluding 2019, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory, declined 3%, while foundry was flat. TSMC's revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, outpacing both the semiconductor ex memory and foundry industry growth.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory continue to be digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to reduce to the seasonal level exiting 2019, setting up a healthier inventory base entering 2020.
Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, our business is expected to be better than the seasonality in recent years, supported by continued ramp of 5G smartphones.
Now I will talk about our capital budget in 2019 and 2020. We expect the ramp of 5G-related and HPC applications to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. In order to meet this increased demand and support of customers' capacity needs, we raised our 2019 CapEx guidance by $4 billion to $14 billion to $15 billion, and we ended up spending $14.9 billion.
Our 2020 capital budget is expected to be between USD 15 billion and USD 16 billion. Out of the $15 billion to $16 billion CapEx for 2020, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies including 3-, 5- and 7-nanometers. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask-making and about 10% for specialty technologies. With this level of capital spending in 2020, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
Now let me turn the microphone to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our 2020 full year outlook.
For the full year of 2020, we forecast the overall semiconductor market growth excluding memory to be 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 17%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth by several percentage points in U.S. dollar term. Our 2020 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, where we see strong interest from all 4 growth platform which are mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive.
Now let me talk about 5G and HPC as the major long-term growth driver for TSMC. We continue to see stronger deployment of 5G networks and smartphones in several major markets around the world. We reiterate mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphones of the total smartphone market in 2020. We also forecast a faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years while silicon content of 5G smartphone will be substantially higher than that of a 4G smartphone.
In addition, the significant performance, bandwidth and latency improvement of 5G network will drive AI application and unlock new usage cases such as real-time response and control across many different types of connected end devices. We believe 5G is a multiyear megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the course of all 4 of our growth platform in the next several years.
With 5G driving exponential network in the amount of big data being generated and continuous improvement in algorithm, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increase in computation power. Thus, HPC become another major long-term growth driver for TSMC.
CPU, networking and AI accelerator will be the main growth area for our HPC platform. By working diligently to provide the foundry industry the most advanced technology and making it available to all the product innovators, TSMC can expand the pool of innovators who fuel the semiconductor industry growth. With the successful ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the upcoming ramp of N6, N5 and N3, we are able to widen our customer product portfolio and expand our addressable market.
We also see growth in networking, thanks to 5G infrastructure deployment over the next few years. With 5G and HPC applications as a major growth driver, we now expect to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.
Now I'll talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6. As N7 enters its third year of ramp, we continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive applications. Our N7+ is entering its second year of ramp. N7+ is the industry's first high-volume production with EUV photolithography technology while paving the way for N6.
Our N6 provides a clear migration path for the next wave N7 products as its design rule are fully compatible with N7 while providing 15% to 20% higher density, which improve power consumption when compared to N7. N6 is on track for risk production in fourth quarter this year and volume production before the end of this year. N6 will have 1 more EUV layer than N7+ and will further extend our N7 family way into the future. We expect our 7-nanometer family to continue to grow in its third year and contribute more than 30% of our wafer revenue in 2020.
Now allow me to talk about our N5 volume production. Our N5 technology is a full node stride from our N7, with 80% logic density gain and about a 20% speed gain compared with 7-nanometer. N5 will adopt the EUV extensively and is well on track for volume production in first half this year and with good yield. We expect a very fast and smooth ramp of N5 in the second half of this year, driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We expect 5-nanometer to contribute about 10% of our wafer revenue in 2020. N5 will be the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. We will offer continuous enhancement to further improve the performance, power and density of our 5-nanometer technology solution into the future as well. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I'll talk about our N3 status. We are working with customers on N3's design, and the technology development progress is going well. We have many technology options in development and we carefully evaluate all the different approaches. Our decision is based on technology maturity, performance and cost. Our N3 will offer another full node scaling benefit in terms of performance, power and density as compared with our N5 technology. We expect our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. We will announce more details about our N3 technology at our TSMC North America Technology Symposium on April 29.
Thank you for your attention. Okay. Thank you. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] So now let's begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the floor. Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. Yes. I guess with the trade war eased a bit, there's still a couple of maybe political issues out there, so I wanted to just start with that. The first one, if you could give some color on TSMC's U.S. content and just if -- maybe the calculation, there's talk about the content threshold lowered to 10%, and if -- there's some talk the equipment may be excluded from that calculation. So if you could give a bit more color about that.
And then second, with more of the geopolitical concerns about some of the military technology, you've talked in the past about not needing to or having more scale with the fabs in Taiwan, but if any new considerations on the fab location? Yes. Happy New Year, everyone. On the possible further tightening up of export control from the U.S. government, I think this is -- they haven't really announced with the specifics about the rules. So everything I say here can only be a speculation. So -- and particularly, I don't want to comment on particular customers. But one thing for sure is our business profile is massive. We are everyone's foundry. And we will deal with each customer fairly and equally.
Secondly is we have been and we will follow the law and regulation. So upon the regulation being effective, we will carefully study and evaluate, product by product, our eligibility in the export. And we really have a very sophisticated export control system. As you might know, every product is calculated automatically. Every product is different in terms of their content. So it's really difficult to describe to you generally what is the content percentages. But I can just tell you that whatever you read on the newspaper, it's not true, okay? So we are prepared to deal with this new export control regulation. Yes. And thanks for clarifying especially that it's not a node by node, which some of the press was speculating.
The second question, I just wanted to ask on the higher CapEx, where it came in the high end of guidance and a higher range of CapEx for 2020. If you could talk maybe the areas where the incremental increase both just from an investment, where that new spend is coming, and maybe what changed on the demand side versus a few months ago to lift the budget.
And then the second part, because of this higher base, how you're looking at kind of the base over the -- say, the following year because now we have a 2-year higher elevated spend, if, say, some moderation from there. Yes, we did increase substantial amount on the CapEx. Let me give you some color why we did that, okay? We expect -- actually, we expect the mobile phone and HPC, these 2 segments probably goes above 20% this year; and with another 2 segments, 2 platforms, automotive and IoT, probably in mid-teens. So put all together, we had to increase the capacity. We work with the customer to fulfill their demand and so that's a result of why we increase our capacity.
Now your question about our growth? Yes. The second question was where the spends sit, like 5, 7 versus back end, so where the additional increase? Okay. A little bit around 7 that we announced in the last year, and then most of them is in 5 and then prepare for 3. And 10% in the back end, 80% in the leading-edge technology, like the 7, 5, 3 altogether. Okay. And then the 2 -- maybe the follow-up I had was just the moderation of CapEx for -- if you expect that to maybe moderate from the very high level next year. In the back end, 10% would be $1.5 billion for CapEx. But I'm curious, maybe between back end and mask, if really over a $1 billion back end CapEx. You're right, I mean, the back end including the mask. Okay. But I guess out of that, do you think the back end CapEx is over $1 billion investment on that side? No. Okay. Okay. And then if -- can you talk about the moderation for... I think, Randy, the last part of your question is talking about our CapEx this year and last year is at a higher level. Looking out the next several years, where do we think the CapEx will be. That would depend on the growth, right? Yes. If we enjoy a good growth in the next 2 years, I think, and if it's a success introduction of our N3, I mean, the CapEx probably will not drop. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Let's go on to the next question. We'll take it from the floor. Citigroup's Roland Shu, over here. First question was just a follow-up on the CapEx there. So with this $15 billion to $16 billion CapEx spending, so what -- how many of the total capacity increase is going to be this year? And how about last year? With this almost $15 billion CapEx spending, how many percent of the CapEx increased last year? Wendell will discuss this question. You're asking about the capacity increase? Yes. Right. Okay. Of course, the increase mainly come from advanced technologies, right? So for 2020, we're looking at mid-single-digit capacity increase. Last year, a low single-digit number. Okay. And then how about the total depreciation is going to be this year? It will increase by high teens in 2020. Okay. And second question is for the gross margin. For your first quarter revenue guidance, U.S. dollar's down slightly. However, apparently in first quarter, we have fewer working days. So it means that your utilization in first quarter definitely is going to be much higher than 4Q. And also for 7-nanometer, last quarter we said that we already -- gross margin has already reached corporate average. And also, I believe in first quarter, we probably won't have the inventory reevaluation. So all on this, so is your gross margin guidance, 48.5% to 50.5%, a little bit conservative? The utilization, we expect it to increase a little bit. And of all the factors that you just mentioned, there's also a potential factor, which is foreign exchange rate impact. There are 6 factors affecting our profitability: the development and ramp of our advanced technology; pricing; cost; utilization; technology mix; and foreign exchange rate. So when you put all these together, that is how we came up with the guidance. Thank you, Roland. All right. Next question will come from Goldman Sachs, Bruce Lu. I try just to get more granularity, color for the 5G penetration rate. Management just mentioned that it's about mid-teens in 2020. Can we have more color in terms of like whether it's sell-in or sell-through or what kind of geography distribution, what kind of distribution between high end and low end for the 5G? Well, I can only say that the 5G's penetration is higher than the 4G. And you know a few countries that they are moving faster than the other area, right? And that's all we know. But we are making the judgment, look at the installation of 5G infrastructure, and we look at each country's adoption and we do our own estimate. That's why we come out with the mid-teens penetration. So it's more from the top-down perspective instead of like bottom-up from like each product line. Is that right? We do both and make a judgment. So in either of those, can you give us some color about why distribution, putting high-end and mid-end... Those are company's confidential. Bruce, do you have a follow-up? Yes, of course. Can I double-check that the assumption of mid-teens penetration is based on like there's no change in terms of the de minimis rule? That's a good question. The change of de minimis rule is still speculative. So our forecast, we assume the business as usual. I understand it. I think the -- yes, the number we currently forecast does not include the de minimis rule tightened change. But for the -- whatever the export control is coming up, we think that 5G's momentum will continue. If any interruption, it will be very short term. After going through the supply chain changes and share exchanges, I think the momentum will -- were just as strong, yes. Okay. Your second question? The second question is regarding to the management. You used to mention that the TSMC becomes more important in terms of geopolitic situations. So does that change your cost of your -- does that change your equation in terms of building out the fab, the cost structures? So in the past, we only care about the manufacturing cost as a main cost factor. But given the current situation, do you think that you have to put that into your consideration as well, i.e., you've built -- management keep on saying that building a factory outside of Taiwan is a lot more expensive than doing that in Taiwan. But with all the geographical risk, that building a factory outside of Taiwan becomes right. Do you see the increasing pressure on that? Do you want to -- do we expect any changes on that? Yes. The cost in Taiwan is lowest among all regions across the world. We have been studying it continuously. And that decision is made to the best interests of our customers. Yes, the geopolitical is evolving, but we still listen to our customers as the priority. And at this point, our customer, when asked to be manufacturing in a higher-cost region, their answer is, ""We cannot be competitive this way."" So to increase the -- to maintain the competitiveness of our customer, currently, this is the fab layout we're having. In the future, right now, it's too early to say. And still, our customer prefer we have the lowest cost production sites and doing business with us. So what if they are willing to pay for a higher price? They may be special products, but by and large, it's unlikely. Thank you. All right. We have -- let's move to the line. We have quite a few callers on the line. So operator, can we take the next call from the line, please? Sure. Your next question comes from the line of Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. My first question is on margins. Given that we are looking at a very strong demand pickup, could we talk a little bit about any change in the view on longer-term gross margins? Do we see a meaningful improvement in gross margins beyond the 50% range that we have been in the last 4 to 5 years?
And also, could you just talk a little bit about the margin dilution impact in second half of 2020 from 5-nanometer? Is it likely to be more modest given there is a very strong 7-nanometer demand also through the course of this year? And I have a follow-up question. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Let me just repeat your question to make sure we got it right. So your first question is asking about sort of with -- given the strong demand pickup, is there any change to TSMC's long-term gross margin target? Why could it not be beyond or above 50%? And then your follow-up or addition to that is looking at this year, could the margin dilution from our 5-nanometer ramp and 7.5 be more modest given the continued strong demand over 7-nanometer? That's right. Right. We continue to use 50% gross margin. We think it's still a very good target. Of all the 6 -- I just mentioned the 6 factors that will affect our profitability. One of them actually relates to the ramp of new nodes. So the ramp of every new node, we will see margin dilutions. This relates to your second question. And indeed, we are seeing a margin dilution in the second half of this year from the N5 ramp. Is it going to be better than before? Yes, but only slightly, okay? And the other factors that I just mentioned include the foreign exchange rate, which is really uncertain for anybody to guess. So at this moment, we believe the 50% gross margin is still a good target for us. Okay. Gokul, do you have a second question? Yes. Could you talk a little bit about what we are seeing in the N-minus-2, N-minus-3 nodes? Should we anticipate any recovery in the situation in 28-nanometer given overall foundry growth seems to be rebounding? And the second part is on 12- and 16-nanometer. Given a lot of the smartphone customer seems to be migrating to 7-nanometer and even 5-nanometer because of the adoption of 5G, will there be any challenge to backfill 12- and 16-nanometer as these customers migrate to more advanced process nodes? Okay. So let me just repeat to make sure we understand again. You're asking about our N-minus-2 and N-minus-3. So first part of your question is, do we see any recovery in the demand for 28-nanometer given the overall strong demand that we see this year? And then the second part of your question is that with a lot of products going from 12- and 16-nanometer very quickly to using our 7 and our 5, will we have challenges or difficulty to backfill 12/16? All right. Let me answer 28-nanometer first. With a strong market growth, 28-nanometer, we did see a little bit better than we expected. However, we have reiterated saying that 28-nanometer's capacity, I think, overbuilt in this industry. So the utilization is still below our average in 28-nanometer. We expect it will be improved in next 1 to 2 years when we develop a new specialty technology for all our customers to utilize it. And we start to see the sign because of former new tapeouts. So we can be sure that 1 to 2 years later, that the utilization rate will go back to company's average. And also 12 and 16? 12 and 16, we did not see that. Today, it's still very strong demand. And there continue to be a very high utilization rate. It is all because of we developed it. We continue to improve the technology. And so it's being utilized. The first wave of smartphone, HPC and now it's IoT, automotive. Okay. Does that answer your questions, Gokul? Yes. The next question comes from the line of Bill Lu from UBS. A question on 5-nanometers. I remember when 7 was ramping, you gave us numbers on the number of tapeouts. I'm wondering if you can help us with 5-nanometer, either also by giving us number of tapeouts, maybe just comparing it to 7 and whether it's higher or lower. Okay. Bill, sorry, you broke up a bit at the end. But I think I understood your question. You want to ask us if we can give you some comparison of the number of tapeouts at 5-nanometer versus our 7-nanometer at a similar stage. Well, the 5-nanometer tapeout is a little bit less than 7-nanometer compared at the same stage of time. However, the most important thing is that the high-volume tapeout is almost equal. And so we expect that our 5-nanometer ramp is very fast and smooth. And it will contribute about 10% to this year's revenue. Okay. Do you have a second? So what's the expectations then? And sorry, just to finish up my first question, so if that's the expectation, then that 5-nanometer will be, in terms of wafer capacity, as big as 7? So we are building the capacity right now and to meet the customers' demand, very high demand. So that's all I can say. Great. Second question is a follow-up on Gokul's question on the 28-nanometers. As you develop these specialty technologies, can you talk about what kind of applications are expected to use these new specialty technologies? Do you want to repeat or... Yes, sorry. Okay. Because you're breaking up a little bit, you were asking, Bill, on 28-nanometer, we talk about developing specialty technologies for 28-nanometer. Your question is what type of applications will be used or these specialty technology is targeting? Well, let me be a bit specific. We are developing the 28-nanometer into 22-nanometer geometry. And ultra-low power is one of the directions we are working on, which can be applied to a lot of IoT devices and also applies to some specialties, such as CMOS image sensor and all others, okay? Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I just had a question on China. China was more than 100% of your Q4 sales growth on a year-on-year basis and sales more than doubled in 2019 from China despite the headwinds from crypto. Can you maybe talk a bit more about the region, what's driving so much growth? And how should we think about China growth specifically in 2020? Okay, Brett. Please allow me to repeat your question. Your question is about our China business. You point out that it was 100% of our fourth quarter growth and grew quite strong in 2019 despite the drop-off in cryptocurrency. So you want us to comment on how we should think about China as a percentage of sales and future growth drivers going forward. Is that correct? Yes. That's right. Well, China is about 20% of our business and has been stable around that number last year this year. So what's changed is I think that last year, we see the China growth particularly strong. And the other regions, such as U.S., probably growth is less. So that is a disjunction for this way. But to continue going on, I think that we expect to maintain this level. Well, let me add some color to it. The same thing, the China's major business with TSMC is also still 5G and the AI, the same thing. Two years ago, probably we have some kind of a big increase in the cryptocurrency, but right now, it's become normal situation. Okay. Brett, do you have a second question? Just a follow-up on that question. Looking at 2020, can you maybe just sort of help us with the drivers for growth from China? Do you think it will be mainly 5G smartphone-related? Is there going to be quite a meaningful contribution from other markets like HPC? Any more color would be very helpful. All right. It will be 5G-related, both smartphone that will be increased and also the networking that's in the HPC area. That's 2 major area that China as a business that will be increasing in 2020. Okay. Brett, do you have a second question? And just the -- yes. And the second question is really targeted at HPC. Can you maybe talk about how much your 7-nanometer capacity is running HPC at present? I think you were planning to ramp that in the second half of '19. But any more color on the portion of 7-nanometer running HPC would be helpful. And how does this scale as we look at 2020, the use of 7-nanometer for HPC? And I think you mentioned 5-nanometer HPC chips would actually ship in 2020. What would they be used for? Any more help there would be great. Okay. Brett, let me just repeat your question. The first part is how much of our 7-nanometer capacity is for HPC products, how much was this last year, how do we expect this capacity for HPC to scale in 2020 for 7-nanometer? And then the second part is for 5-nanometer, what types of HPC products or applications are being used on 5-nanometer? Well, we do not disclose the capacity breakdown for a specific node. In terms of revenue on the HPC in N7, actually, all I want to say is that it continues to grow, to increase, and we expect that this momentum will continue in the next few years. For the N5, as we said, it's driven by mobile phone and HPC. Still, the 2 biggest increasing this year. Okay. Thank you. Let's come back to the floor for -- open the floor for questions. Next question will come from Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan. So my first question is about your future technology developments, right? So next year, I'm not sure if you are going to introduce so-called 5-nanometer pro -- process. And can you comment that a little bit? And if you let the extension of the current 5-nanometer, does that mean possibly to your gross margin improvements? So that is the first question. We continue to improve the performance of each node. So next year, you're talking about 5 pro? Yes, 5-nanometer pro or... Or whatever. Okay. It will be better than this year's 5-nanometer, that's for sure, all right? And all the major customers will use it. And so the gross margin improvement, that will be the same as the previous node. It takes about 7 quarter to -- 6 to 8, okay, 6 to 8 quarter to reach the company's average. Okay. Okay. So I would assume that 5-nanometer gross margin will continue to improve into next year. That's for sure. Okay. And next is I'm really interested in your 3-nanometer, right? So currently, what is this for, meaning the cost per transistor? Do you think you can really reduce the cost per transistor level at 3-nanometer? And I'm also curious, given this assumption, do you think HPC or mobile will be a bigger user for your coming 3-nanometer, focusing both CPU or smartphone AP? Per transistor cost, I believe it'll continue to reduce, okay? That's for sure. Now who is going to use it? That's a major question. Again, still high-end smartphone and HPC will be the users, all right? I cannot be more specific to tell you whom, but that's it. Can I switch back to some near-term follow-up? Let's stick with 2 questions first and then go back in the queue, we can come back. Sorry. Thank you. Next question will come from CLSA, Sebastian Hou over here. So my first question is to follow on Chairman's comments about that you see the 5G momentum will continue to be strong, even if there's a change on the U.S. exporting rule. Maybe just some near-term disruption because TSMC has evaluated the supply chain change. So can you elaborate more about what the supply chain change you have seen to make you such -- give you such confidence that there will be just a near-term disruption even if there is some change on the exporting rule? Well, this is a forward-looking analysis. So I think that some of you also did analysis. Basically, the smartphone, you have to look at this smartphone demand per year. And the -- and then look at the 5G penetration per year, who will be the smartphone supplier, it can change; who will be their shares and where the 5G base station been produced, that will change. So all these things really depends on the -- it boils down to really the forward-looking smartphone demand, would that be interrupted. That's the analysis. I think that if any disruption, it will be a shorter term, yes. Okay. So my follow-up question on that is smartphone, we understand. So if A brand, they lose share, B, C brands will pick up. But what about the infrastructure? If there is a disruption on the infrastructure because one of the key infrastructure supplier may not have the critical processors, so which means the whole 5G infra build-out may be slowed down, postponed? And what's the point of having those 5G smartphone where the whole supply chain, the whole 5G piece has been postponed? I think industry will find -- I think there's no businesses with just 1 player for too long, okay? The second and third player will -- sooner or later will come up and it could be pretty soon. And it's, in our business, always a competitive environment. So yes, we have a #1 enter the market, but the #2 and #3 is not too far away. Okay. My second question is on the guidance that the company give this year, that the foundry industry is growing 17%; semis, excluding memory, is about 8%. I think if I look at that historically, the -- usually, I think the formula for TSMC's growth is usually the global GDP. And semi is about like 2, 3 percent point above that, foundry a little bit above that and TSMC is a little bit above that. So TSMC get a 5% to 10% of the CAGR. So I think that is a very simple formula. But has the formula changed? So I mean that historically, semiconductor is highly correlated with the global GDP growth to some extent. So if TSMC with the foundry industry growing faster, is it like the foundry/TSMC becomes the outlier or it's because also that you're implying that the whole economy is growing faster? Now this time, we have a higher growth rate, right, for foundry and for TSMC and all because of driven by 5G and AI's application. So whether we can increase our forecast. For example, TSMC always say 5% to 10% CAGR is that our goal. We certainly hope that we can exceed that. But this year, it's still too early to say. But we stay what we said. The foundry industry will be 17% and TSMC will be better than that. Sebastian, let me add to this. This year, the formula does change a bit. We put it in the Korean -- captive Korean player foundry -- captive into the foundry, okay, which is they do that and constantly. So this time, we put the Korean players captive into the foundry business. So that's why you see the growth quite faster, yes. Okay. So -- but if we also look at -- I think the company also made a comment that you're seeing your 5-year CAGR to be higher, at the high end of the 5% to 10%. So it's not just 1 year, right, it's just a flash in the pan. So I think if you look at the longer time frame, which means I think there will be more -- I think the correlation with the global GDP, I think that makes more sense, more representative. So does that also mean that like semis and tech innovation is going to drive the global economy grow faster in the next couple of years? Or is it just because global GDP still grow as the growth at 2%, 3% but semis, foundries, TSMC become the outlier, that gap is getting bigger? Oh, we don't want to say it's an outlier. We continue to forecast global GDP still in a normal situation, provided the trade tension between the 2 big countries did not deteriorate. But for semiconductor, I want to say that the content of the semiconductor in our life continue to increase, provided -- see that you can see the big example in the smartphone. You can see the big example in the automotive. And you can see that IoT is a big increase also. So now it's changing our world. And that all because of semiconductor content. It's not because of what GDP suddenly become grow faster. And it's not because of semiconductors is an outlier. It will continue to be this way. Yes. And remember, last year, as Wendell said, the -- it's the semi industry ex memory was a year of decline. So obviously, there's a base effect in play as well for 2020. Yes, sure. I'm talking about 5 years. Sure. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Let's move back to the line, please, and we'll take the next question from the line, please, operator? Your question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. I have one clarification. When you were referring to 5-nanometer, does that include 6? And if it doesn't, what is your view of availability of 6-nanometer by year-end '20? Like to repeat the question. You say that 5-nanometer, it's including 6 or not? Now, 6 is 7-nanometer's family. So we look at the 7, 7 plus, the 6 as 1 family. 5 is another big node. Okay. And you're still on schedule to have 6 available by end of this year, correct? Volume production at the end of this year. Right now, it's ready for our customers' tapeout. Sure. Okay. And then in terms of just the -- we were talking about the growth more than 20%. At the same time, one of the leading microprocessor manufacturer based in North America has talked about increased outsourcing. And I just want to get your view. When you look into the longer term, would there be a structural change in semiconductor manufacturing, where TSMC would actually be able to grab higher market share because they will be more outsourced specifically from a key company based in North America? All right. Let me repeat your question, Mehdi. I think you're asking us to comment on the potential for an increased outsourcing from a major microprocessor or CPU vendor. Long term, could this be a structural change and the potential for long-term -- longer-term outsourcing? Yes. We certainly welcome that outsourcing continue to grow. And for TSMC, all I can say is we develop the technology to meet our customers' requirement. And we are confident that we are the best technology leader and we have excellent manufacturing. And of course, as a result, we expect that we gain some market share out of it. But that is for the future for TSMC's growth. And I cannot be more specific than that. Okay. Thank you. Let's move on. We have a follow-up question from the line from JPMorgan's Gokul Hariharan. So a quick question on the high end of the 5% to 10% growth. Could you talk a little bit about why only high end of 5% to 10% when the CapEx increase seems to be 40% to 50% from the last kind of $10 billion to $12 billion -- $10 billion to $11 billion CapEx change over the last 5 years? Any reasons why we are a bit more cautious? Do we feel that the 5G cycle after a couple of years could start to kind of decelerate? Especially given this year, we are already starting off with a very strong 20% kind of growth. So just wanted to think about the puts and takes in terms of the high end of 5% to 10%, and why not stronger than that growth, given the big jump in CapEx and indication that CapEx could stay around these levels even going into the 3-nanometer era. Okay. Gokul, let me try to summarize your question. Basically, Gokul was asking why our long-term growth target is only at the high end of 5% to 10% when our CapEx has increased 40% to 50% versus the $10 billion to $12 billion in the past. He is asking or wondering, is this because we take a more cautious view that 5G cycle may be strong this year and next year but may slow down after that? And so why do we still say at the high end of 5% to 10%? Last year, before we increased the CapEx, we were looking at somewhere in the middle of that 5% to 10%. But afterwards, when we see the ramp in 5G deployment, we increased the CapEx. And now we're looking at high end of the 5% to 10% range. So that is the difference.
And also let me explain this from a capital intensity point of view. Last year, while we increased the CapEx, the capital intensity was over 40%. This year, we think it will be lower than 40%. And from next year on, although it's still pretty early, we think it will be somewhere between 30% or 35%, which is pretty similar to the old norm that we used to say before. Gokul, do you have a second question? Yes. Just one more broader question for Dr. Liu. At a Board level, Dr. Liu, could you talk a little bit about how the Board thinks about TSMC's positioning as a foundry for everyone, everybody's foundry, given the broader geopolitical changes that are happening? I don't want to go into each episode in terms of like the change in the de minimis rule, et cetera, but thinking 4 to 5 years out, how does -- or what are the steps that the Board is considering to kind of -- to ensure that TSMC can remain everybody's foundry even in a more challenging kind of geopolitical environment and a lot more policy kind of blips compared to, say, the last 5 to 7 years? Okay. Let me try to summarize your question. Again, I think he's asking -- Gokul's asking for Mark to please share your thoughts on, from a Board level, TSMC's positioning as everyone's foundry. Of course, we're facing a lot of different geopolitical changes and challenges. Gokul doesn't need us to comment on each one. But generally, how are we thinking about 5 to 7 years out, how TSMC can position ourselves and how we can remain to be everyone's foundry? Yes. The -- first of all, currently, we discuss the strategy with the Board. And the Board fully agree with our current strategy, okay? And of course, this strategy contains several necessary component. First of all, we develop our technology ourselves. All the technology, IP and know-how and technology all developed in Taiwan here. Secondly is another necessary element is our technology has to be leaders. When you're technology leaders, people will have to come to you. And that's how we maintain to be everyone's foundry. There are exceptions, of course, because of their domestic trade policy that I cannot overcome. But basically, that so far, this strategy should be able to play on. Okay. Does that answer your question, Gokul? Yes. All right. Thank you. Let's come back to the floor and see if there's any follow-up questions from anyone? Morgan Stanley, Charlie? So first of all, for first quarter, you mentioned that utilization rates are higher, but in terms of U.S. dollars revenue go down slightly. So what is the ASP or product mix this year? So Charlie is asking that we said first quarter, the utilization rate will slightly increase, but our U.S. -- our guidance shows a slight decrease in the U.S. -- in the revenue in terms of U.S. dollars. So why is that? Does that imply an ASP change? Last year, fourth quarter or even third quarter last year, part of the wafer revenue come from wafers prepared in the first quarter -- first half of 2019, when the utilization was pretty low. And we're pretty much digesting all of those already. Okay. So it looks like the year is open, right? But do you see any kind of -- any next data points, for example, any segment or any customers cutting forecast for orders recently? Can you comment on that? No, we did not see that. And lastly, it's a little bit subtle, right? CapEx, I think 3 months ago, I think the guidance for this year, CapEx is USD 14 billion to USD 15 billion. But now it's like -- it's like USD 1 billion higher. So what is that additional CapEx for? Is that mainly for 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer? Well, other than the advanced technology, we also mentioned earlier, we also increased the CapEx this year for specialty technology as well as advanced packaging. So those are the areas that we are focusing on. Okay. And lastly, if I may, I guess a market share question. We appreciate that the company provide your assumption for industry growth, right? So I guess, first of all, we want to clarify when you add Korea captive foundry in the comparison, you said apple-to-apple comparison, meaning do you include that into last year's revenue base? I think we did, right? Yes, we did. Okay. So include then, apple-to-apple comparison is up 17%. Up 17%. Okay. And that relates to China competitors' market share. I think that that's a... I think that probably needs to correct it. I don't think we include the foundry growth in last year, the Samsung captive supply, yes. So the growth is 17%, it's particularly high. Okay. So what is a kind of apple-to-apple comparison then? I think 6 points. So it will be 11% in the apple-to-apple comparison. Okay. So based on that kind of 11% industry growth, right, I think lots of investors are asking whether you are sort of losing market share in China because China want to push the localization, right? And so some [ chatters ] are talking about SMIC and taking more orders from you guys at 14-nanometer. Can you also comment a little bit on this front? Usually, we don't specifically answer these kind of very sensitive questions specifically on one competitor. But let me tell you that what the newspapers say, it is not, well, true. All right. Thank you. Yes. Charlie, also let me just clarify, last time, we did not say that $14 billion to $15 billion for 2020 CapEx. We said it would probably stay at a similar level as 2019. But we do not specifically say that dollar range, all right? Just to clarify.
All right. Let's go back to the line. Sorry, we have a follow-up from SIG, Mehdi. Wanted to go back to your commentary about the 5G phone. And how should I think about opportunities if I were to think about the sub-6 versus millimeter wave? Specifically, do you think that this year, opportunities with mobile, you talked about a 20% -- more than 20% growth, is that all going to be sub-6? Or is it going to be a mix of the 2 technologies? Do you want to repeat it? I think the question is clear enough. If the 5G grows, is that because of sub-6 or the millimeter wave? My answer is both, okay? That's the 5Gs are phone and the base station is for sub-6 and the millimeter wave. Do you have a second question, Mehdi? Yes. Actually, if I were to have a follow-up, do you think you will actually be building a millimeter wave phone or for millimeter wave, it's just going to be limited to base station? Okay. Actually, the phone is much easier to build with millimeter wave plus sub-6. The base station probably will have a much higher number in sub-6 rather than millimeter wave. All right. Let's come back to the floor. We have a follow-up from Crédit Suisse, Randy Abrams. You talked about the good investment in the back end. Last year, I think you said $2.5 billion was the revenue run rate in 2018. If you can maybe give a view of the size of the business now and maybe what type of growth you're expecting for this year. Yes. The revenue size of back end was $2.8 billion in 2019. We're expecting double-digit growth for this year, mid-teens. Mid-teens, right. Okay. And if I could ask on the 2 other areas that don't get as much attention, automotive and IoT. So automotive was depressed last year. But I think you're talking about a pretty big pickup to grow teens. Could you talk to the areas, like if it's just cyclical rebound or if there are certain types of product or components coming back for the automotive, where you're gaining content share?
And for the automotive -- sorry, for the IOT, it was very strong growth. It's a big category. So if you could maybe center on if there's a few particular pieces within IoT driving the momentum for that category. Well, actually, the growth this year, it's most come from the content increase rather than the unit increase. Because we -- I just mentioned that it will be mid-teens, right, mid-teens increase. Certainly, it's not mid-teens units. You don't expect so many car being sold. And so it's a the content. The semiconductor content, the increase is more important than the unit. And then Randy is also asking about for IoT, are there specific areas or segments that's driving the growth in IoT? Well, wearable is very popular now everywhere. And according to our Chairman, its content also increased. Next, we have a follow-up from Citigroup, Roland Shu. Yes. Last time, CEO guided you expected the 7-nanometer revenue will continue growth in 2020. So do you still hold that view? Yes. So how much growth will be this year? So last year, we have 27%. Is this able to above the highest level of 20-nanometer, around 34%? Close. Okay. And also for 7-nanometer, do you see any competitor with the technology breakthrough and likely to impact or taking your market share in the near term? Can you repeat the question? Sorry. Yes. Do you see any competitors with 7-nanometer technology breakthrough and will likely to threat you or take your market share going forward? We will continue to hold a very high market share. That's all we can say. And I don't comment on my competitor. Okay. Yes. My second question is you said that you continue expanding your customer and the product portfolio. And so you have new customers and the products from cryptocurrency in 2018. And the last year, you have this new CPU foundry outsourcing as your new customer in technology. So how about this year? Do you see any new customer or new applications to contribute to your growth? If this year's growth, counting on my customer is what we engaged last year already. So as I said, we continue to expand our product portfolio, and we continue to increase the number of our customers. So I think the content increase along with 5G penetration is the major phenomenon, including the leading-edge as well as the mature nodes. And it's just a wide spread of customers or existing customers, yes. Okay. We have a follow-up here from CLSA, Sebastian Hou. My first follow-up is we heard that the 7-nanometer demand is very strong at TSMC. And most of the customers are on allocation mode right now. So with another -- a step-up of CapEx for this year, I believe some of that also devote into 7-nanometer for this year. Do you still expect this similar tightness that your customer may experience on 7-nanometer by the end of this year? We do have very high demand from 7-nanometer. And we work very hard to meet customers' demand. Last year, we announced that we put $1.5 billion more to increase the 7-nanometer's capacity. We work hard to increase the capacity. Yes. With 5-nanometer ramp up in the second half of this year, the tightness of 7-nanometer we hopefully can be soothed a bit, yes, for the customers. Okay. And is there -- are there any process nodes that TSMC is seeing not growing this year? 28-nanometer. But 28 is already pretty low last year. But you're still seeing that not growing? You say not growing, right? Yes, not growing. All right. So even for 16, 12, this platform, TSMC also expects that to go up. Okay. So that's why you say that the newspaper is wrong. I don't want to be so specific. Okay. Well, that's pretty clear. All right. In the interests of time, we'll see if there's any last questions from anybody. If not, then this concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 4 hours from now.

And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, for his opening remarks. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Mark Liu, here.
Before we start our financial report, I want to take a moment to thank each of you for joining us online today. To many of you from different parts of the world, in this very time of devastating pandemic, our thoughts and hearts are with you. TSMC, so far, safeguarded our global operations successfully, but we do not take it for granted. We will continue our utmost efforts to weather this storm, and we are in this together. In the meantime, I want to extend our best wishes to you and your families for staying safe and healthy.
So, now let me turn the microphone over to Wendell for the summary of operations and current quarterly guidance. Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter, followed by the guidance for the current quarter.
First quarter revenue in NT decreased 2.1% sequentially, which is less than seasonality, due to the increase in HPC-related demand and the continued ramp of 5G smartphones. Gross margin increased 1.6 percentage points sequentially to 51.8%, thanks to a higher level of utilization, which was partially offset by an unfavorable exchange rate.
Total operating expenses decreased by TWD 2.6 billion, mainly as 5-nanometer technology moved from R&D stage to mass production during the first quarter. Operating margin increased by 2.2 percentage points sequentially to 41.4%.
Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 4.51, and ROE was 28.4%. Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 7-nanometer process technology contributed 35% of wafer revenue in the first quarter. 10-nanometer was 0.5% and 16-nanometer was 19%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 55% of wafer revenue.
Now move on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 9% quarter-over-quarter to account for 49% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 3% to account for 30%. IoT increased 8% to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 1% to account for 4%. Digital consumer electronics increased 44% to account for 5%.
Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 562 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities remained relatively flattish. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days was 42 days. Days of inventory decreased two days to 53 days with higher wafer shipment in the quarter.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 203 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 193 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for second quarter '19 cash dividend. We also increased TWD 20 billion in short-term loans mainly for hedging purpose. Overall, our cash balance decreased TWD 25 billion to TWD 431 billion at the end of the quarter.
In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures reached $6.4 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between $10.1 billion and $10.4 billion, which represent a 0.6% sequential decrease at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 30, gross margin is expected to be between 50% and 52%, operating margin between 39% and 41%.
Now I will hand over the call to C.C. for his key message. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
Let me start with COVID-19 preventive measurement at TSMC. To prevent the epidemic of COVID-19, many of us around the world have had to change the way we live and work since mid-January. Let me start with by sharing something that -- what we take at TSMC. Our top priority is to protect the health and safety of all our employees at all times.
At the outbreak of COVID-19, we immediately suspended all noncritical business travel and restricted visit on-site access with mandatory self-screening. All employees are required to do daily temperature checks with self-declaration, wear masks all the time and practice social distancing in the office. Since late March, we have taken further preventive actions such as having employee work from home where possible. We are physically separating on-site employees into red and blue teams to reduce the risk of community spread.
On March 18, we found one employee who tested positive for COVID-19 and immediately began receiving appropriate care. Today, this employee has recovered, is out of the hospital and is staying at home for additional quarantine. We were able to suitably trace all the other individuals who were in contact. The neighboring employees have all tested negative, while all other employees who were in contact has entered and completed the 14-day self-quarantine and now back to work. As a result of the strict preventive measures taken by TSMC, we have not seen any disruption of our fab operations so far.
Now I will talk about our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 310.6 billion or $10.3 billion. In line with our guidance given three months ago, our first quarter business declined about 1% sequentially, which is much less than seasonality, due to the increase in HPC-related demand and the continued ramp of 5G smartphone.
Moving into second quarter 2020, we expect our revenue to be flattish, as weaker mobile product demand is expected to be balanced by continued 5G deployment and HPC-related product launches. While we have not seen significant order reduction from our customers, so far, we do observe supply chain dislocation and weaker end market demand from COVID-19 in the first half of this year. In the near term, we have observed weaker end demand in applications, such as consumer electronics and automotives. Meanwhile, we have also observed better demand from HPC, as compared to three months ago, driven by the trends such as work from home.
Looking ahead to the second half of this year. Due to the market uncertainty, we adopt a more conservative view as we expect COVID-19 to continue to bring some level of disruption to the end market demand. For the whole year of 2020, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory growth, to be flattish to slightly decline, while foundry industry growth is expect to be high single-digit to low-teens percentage.
For TSMC, although this uncertainty exists, we believe we can do better and grow at mid- to high-teens percentage in 2020 in U.S. dollar term. All the above forecasts for semiconductor exclude memory market, foundries and TSMC are based upon the assumption of COVID-19 stabilizing in June of this year.
Now let me talk about the progress and development of 5G and HPC. With the recent disruption from COVID-19, we now expect global smartphone units to decline high single digit year-over-year in 2020. However, 5G network deployment continues and OEMs continue to prepare to launch 5G phones. We maintain our forecast for mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market in 2020.
We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphones, as compared to 4G, over the next several years, with substantially higher silicon content. Thus, we believe 5G as a multiyear megatrend is still strong and will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years. HPC will be another major long-term growth driver for TSMC.
In the next few years, a smarter and more intelligent world connected by 5G networks will require massive increase in computation power. CPU, networking and AI accelerators will be the main growth areas for our HPC platform. Thus, while near-term uncertainty exists, we will continue to invest in our R&D and technology capabilities to capture the future opportunities from the strong 5G-related and HPC megatrends. We reaffirm our goal to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.
Now let me talk about the ramp-up of N7, N7+ and the status of N6. In its third year of ramp, N7 continue to see very strong demand across a wide spectrum of products for mobile, HPC, IoT and automotive applications. Our N7+ is entering its second year of ramp using EUV lithography technology while paving the way for N6. Our N6 provides a clear migration path for next-wave N7 products, as the design rules are fully compatible with N7.
N6 has already entered its production and is on track for volume production before the end of this year. N6 will have one more EUV diode than N7+ and will further extend our 7-nanometer family well into the future. We expect our 7-nanometer family to continue to grow in its third year and reaffirm it will contribute more than 30% of our wafer revenue in 2020.
Now let me talk about our N5 status. N5 is already in volume production with good yield. Our N5 technology is a full node stride from our N7, with 80% logic density gain and about 20% speed gain compared with N7. N5 will adopt EUV extensively. We expect a very fast and smooth ramp of N5 in the second half of this year driven by both mobile and HPC applications. We'll reiterate 5-nanometer will contribute about 10% of our wafer revenue in 2020.
N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with best PPA. We observed a higher number of tapeouts, as compared with N7 at the same period of time. We will offer continuous enhancements to further improve the performance, power and density of our 5-nanometer technology solution into the future as well. Thus, we are confident that 5-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about our N3 status. Our N3 technology development is on track, with risk production scheduled in 2021 and target volume production in second half of 2022. We have carefully evaluated all the different technology options for our N3 technology, and our decision is to continue to use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and costs.
Our N3 technology will be another full node stride from our N5, with about a 70% larger density gain, 10 to 15 speed gain and 25% to 30% power improvement as compared with N5. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced and will further extend our leadership position well into the future.
Now let me turn the microphone over to our CFO. Thank you, C.C. Let me start by making some comments on our second quarter and second half profitability outlook. We have just guided second quarter of 2020 gross margin to be similar to the first quarter. Looking ahead to second half, we expect the steep ramp-up of our 5-nanometer will dilute our second half gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points. In addition, our overall capacity utilization may be impacted by the uncertainty from COVID-19. Thus, our gross margin in the second half of this year may be several percentage points lower than in the first half.
Looking at our other profitability factors, our leadership in technology development and ramp-up remains strong. We continue to provide value to our customers and drive aggressive cost reduction. Thus, we believe our long-term gross margin target of about 50% is still a good target.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years. While the impact of COVID-19 virus brings near-term uncertainties, we expect the multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. Thus, we reaffirm our 2020 capital budget to be between $15 billion and $16 billion.
Now I will make some comments on our capital management and shareholder returns. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the capital -- the Company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable cash dividend to shareholders. With our solid financial performance, strong balance sheet and cash position and capacity to take on debt, we're able to aggressively invest in our future to enhance our technologies and capabilities.
This enables us to continue to outgrow the semiconductor industry even in an extreme macroeconomic environment like this year. With our rigorous capital management, we remain committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. Meanwhile, with the semiconductor industry's highest credit rating, we're able to bolster our cash balance by issuing corporate bonds at a low interest rate.
That concludes my message. Thank you. This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask questions. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]
Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line, please? Thank you. The first question we have is from the line of Randy Abrams from Crédit Suisse. Your line is now open. First question is just two parts, wanted to go into the change in forecasts versus January, if you could give an update on the change in expectation across your growth platforms, which areas are you revising and have you seen -- I’m curious have you seen a change in customer orders or you're proactively expecting this to come. And the second part, if you -- you sometimes give a view on inventory levels. Factoring your sales have held up in planning guidance, if you could give an expectation on where you think inventory levels at your customers are trending and if you're factoring any risk of correction of inventory levels and some of the supply bottlenecks used. Okay. Randy, please allow me to try to make sure and repeat your questions. So your first question is two parts. You want to know what is driving the change in our forecasts as compared to what we have said in January. Have we seen any change in the outlook for our different platforms? Have we seen changes in customer orders? Or is part of our forecasting assumption sort of what will happen in the second half? And then the second part of the question is on the fabless and the inventory level that we see. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. All right. This is C.C. Wei. Let me answer that why we changed our forecast. Because -- we do observe some of the end markets become soft. As I state in the statement, that we saw some consumer electronics such as smartphone or those kind of things has been in the end market become much softer than we thought. However -- so we do the forecasts now based on the customers' orders because customer today.
As I said, we did not see any significant reduction in our customer demand. But we do expect the end demand will have some impact in the following second half of this year. As a result, we changed our -- well, we modified our forecasts as compared with the January number. To be specific, except for the HPC -- the HPC has been very strong. All other three areas, like smartphone, IoT or automotive, are decreasing our forecasts as compared with what we announced in January. Okay. Let me take the inventory part. The inventory level of our fabless customers that we track was healthy exiting fourth quarter of last year. However, given the disruption from COVID-19, we currently expect that inventory level to rise in first half of '20 before digesting in second half of '20. Okay. Randy, yes, do you have a second question? Yes. Okay. Second question, and it really gets into the U.S. There's been press stories about them considering equipment license restrictions. And I'm curious if you could discuss how you're managing the risk or how much risk you see from that equipment license requirement that could affect one of your key customers. And in terms of the CapEx budget for this year, do you still have flexibility to make any changes to this year either for this factor or for COVID-19 if the impact appears a bit worse? Or is it pretty much locked in for 2020? Okay. Sorry, Randy. You're a little bit breaking up, so let me try to summarize your question. So your second question, first, you relate to some of the news reports on the potential for U.S. equipment license restrictions. So you want to understand how does TSMC manage this risk. And then also as related to part of that, what is our CapEx flexibility for 2020 in case COVID-19 situation or these restrictions? Is there flexibility in our CapEx? Yes, that's correct. Okay, let me answer your question as much as I can. We are now aware about the recent development of U.S. trade rule changes. However, these rule changes have -- is still under draft. And they are information, but we know that the final rule is not yet finalized. And after the finalized draft, there will be another 30 days of grace period for the industry to respond. In general, we share the concerns, all the concerns of U.S. semiconductor communities such as voices from semi or from SIA.
While the draft is not finished, we are -- we have studied the various scenarios. And yes, there may be some near-term impact. And we will take -- work with our customer dynamically, and we will take appropriate measures so that to minimize the impact to TSMC. However, for the mid- to long term, we think the underlying megatrend still holds. And some supply chain will be readjusted, and the balance will start. So we will be able to still capture our mid- to long-term growth opportunities. And therefore, the current long-term CapEx, we do not see this impacted by this change. Okay. Does that answer your question, Randy? Yes. And maybe it is the contingency, if there's any flexibility, either from this factor if it doesn’t go ahead or if it's more -- would be more on a forward basis. But is your flexibility, say the COVID-19 doesn't get contained, is largely most of the spending already planned out kind of timed to those megatrends but it's -- but if you do have flexibility to adjust that or any potential in a downside case. So you -- okay. So Randy is asking, do we -- then for our 2020 CapEx, is there any -- what is our flexibility in case of COVID-19 uncertainty and such? Right. We will remain as flexible as we can as we continue to monitor the virus situation and work very closely with our customers. At the same time, the majority of our CapEx is spent on advanced nodes that drives our growth in the next year and beyond. As we expect the multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years continuing, we will continue to prudently invest for our future growth. Okay. Thank you, Wendell. The next question is from the line of Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. So could we go through a little bit in terms of how we think about forecasting growth? I think given that, if we look at the last 2, 3 times where we've had economic corrections, it seems like the industry has seen meaningful declines in revenues. Now we are looking at largely flattish for semi ex memory. So are we expecting that we get a pretty strong rebound into the second half of the year in terms of -- so I just wanted to go through TSMC's process of thinking about overall semiconductor industry growth and since we also expect small inventory correction happening in second half of the year. And I have a follow-up question as well. Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your question. I think your question is asking, in the past when there's a severe economic correction, the semi industry also sees a large revenue decline, so why is semi ex memory this year kind of flattish? And how do we explain our full year outlook of mid- to high teens? And do we expect a more meaningful inventory correction in the second half of this year? Is that right? That's right, yes. Well, the semiconductor excluding memory, as I said, that the end market in the consumer electronics were declined. However, as -- I also mentioned that because of work from home or those communications created a lot of demand on the servo and the world communications. So the HPC was been very good, as compared with our forecast in January. Net-net, so we give kind of the semiconductor industry's growth this year probably is a low single digit or what could be a little bit negative. That's based on what our forecast today. And what is the second question? He's asking sort of then do we expect a meaningful inventory correction going into the second half. We cannot forecast so accurately, but... No. Let me add something, some color. Now as C.C. just mentioned, based on our current outlook, our second half revenue is somehow flattish or may decline slightly. That really gives you an idea that the inventory is digesting in the second half of the year as for now, as we can see. Okay. Great. Gokul, does that address – yes, go ahead with your second question. Yes, that addresses my first question. Second question, could you talk a little bit about the shape of the 5-nanometer ramp-up in second half of the year? I mean previously, I think, we have talked about this being faster than 7-nano in 2018 and probably around 10% of revenues. Are you seeing any changes to that as a result of some of the weakness that we have seen in the consumer electronic vertical? Or for 5-nano, we are still expecting a similar kind of ramp as we expected in January. To be sure, we don't expect any change as compared with the January, our forecast. Today, we still see the tapeout very on schedule, and the ramp-up is also on schedule, although we did see some of the equipment delivery have been delayed a little bit, but we are working with the equipment vendor. All in all, we think that 5-nanometer's ramp-up is on track, and we still say that it will contribute about 10% of the total revenue, wafer revenue. Okay. Thank you, C.C. We have the next question from the line of Roland Shu from Citi. Your line is now open. First, I congratulate you for a very good first quarter result. I will have a follow-up of this whole year revenue growth question. I think now you are looking for this mid- to high-teens percentage point kind of growth for the whole year revenue. So my question is then do you factor in any equipment, material or any kind of ramp-up schedule disruption for this supply chain due to this troubled times. Okay. No, we did not see any disruption from the material supply or any supply chains activity that have been in disruption mode, although I did say that because of shelter in home, that some of the tool delivery has been delayed from two weeks to about one month. However, as I said, we continue to work with tool vendors and minimize the impact on the capacity building. So for the whole year, we don't expect it to have a big impact. Understood. But how about for the equipment startup point of it? Because of shelter in home or travel ban, I think equipment vendors probably won't have enough engineer to do the equipment startup. Will that impact your ramp-up schedule? Well, that has been planned from the outbreak of COVID-19. We already worked with a tool vendor. So they arranged enough engineering resources in Taiwan or all over the world, so we don't worry with that portion. Okay. For my second question, I would like to ask about your capital management. Normally, I think in the past you funded all of your CapEx spending from your operating cash flow. And now you just partly fund it by issuance of the corporate bond. Again, Wendell explained this actually, how you’d like to preserve our cash for -- invest for net growth. So question is , first, for this issuance of the corporate bond, is there any upper limit you have, I think, in order to fund your CapEx? Will you continue to issue this corporate bond? Roland, first of all, the -- we expect our operating cash flow to continue to be sufficient to finance our capital expenditure. Secondly, the decision to issue corporate bond was before -- was made before the COVID-19. We looked at our future expansion plans. We looked at the current interest rates, and we decided it's good timing to issue a low-cost corporate bond just for any uncertainties. Understood. Okay. And for your cash dividend, I think, Wendell, you said that you would like to start maintain a sustainable cash dividend in both quarterly and annual basis. So understood, I think that your annual basis policy is paying total cash not less than previous year's. And how about your quarterly cash dividend policy? Is this like the TWD 2.5 per quarter -- per share per quarter policy to TSMC? Okay, Roland. So your question on the cash dividend, you say that we will not -- our sustainable cash dividend policy on an annual basis means we will not pay less than TWD 10 in any year going forward. Then your question is, on a quarterly basis, will we pay less than TWD 2.5 on a quarterly basis? No. No. Yes. Okay? Well, the quarterly cash dividend will be subject to change. However, the whole year annual cash dividend have been -- that will be still and can’t be lower than previous year's, right? No. Roland, the quarterly cash dividend will not be lower than the previous quarter. And as a result, you won't have lower annual dividends than the previous year. Okay. So even though -- so let's say from now we are paying TWD 2.5 per share per quarter. So it means that going forward, our quarterly cash dividend won't be less than TWD 2.5 going forward, right? Yes, you are correct. Next question is from Bill Lu from UBS. Your line is now open. Yes. My first question is on 5 nanometers. It is TSMC's first full EUV node and it is now in production. So 2-part question. One is I know, this year, it is on track, but if you look at the customer adoptions going to 2021, can you give us some ideas for maybe the number of customers that are going to use 5 nanometers or maybe revenue contribution? Secondly, now that we're in production, can you talk about the learnings on 5, so far? Specifically, can you talk a little bit about maybe cycle time versus 7 nanometers, that yield ramp, and maybe on the cost side how it compares to 7? Just because it is the first EUV node. All right. Will you repeat the question again before I take it? Sure. Okay. So Bill's question is on 5-nanometer and EUV, two parts. One, he wants to know that we are ramping -- we see a steep ramp in the second half of this year, but what does 5-nanometer look like for 2021 in terms of customer adoption, the number of customers or the revenue percentage contribution in 2021? That's the first part. And then the second part is can we share some of the learnings that we have seen on our 5-nanometer in terms of cycle time, yield or costs versus 7-nanometer. Well, Bill, let me answer the first part of -- first. This year, as we said, we are going to ramp up, well, steeply and smoothly. And how about the 2021? Well, continue to ramp up. That's all I can answer you. So how many customer or how many tapeouts it is? Actually the customer come from everywhere. I mean that's a mobile phone, HPC-related and maybe some of them from the IoT and automotive. We don't know yet, but today we've got a lot of tapeout from mobile and HPC related. The cycle time, the yield today is quite good. Actually, it's ahead of our plan. And what is the cost? Cost is reasonable. Of course, we are continuing to work on productivity improvement so that we can share with our customer. But as far as I can know, I can understand, the cost, the cycle time are all very good. That's all I can say. Okay. Do you have a second question, Bill? Yes. The second question is on COVID-19. And it looks like the Company is doing a really good job of managing it in terms of fab operations, but I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how this might impact your decision-making longer term. How would you change how you're managing the Company given that -- given COVID-19? For example, does this change your view at all in terms of building a fab in the U.S.? I don't think that because of COVID-19 we have changed our decision-making process where we reduce our efficiency. I do believe this is a temporary phenomena and although I did say that we have red and blue teams. I did say that we have practiced some work from home, but I don't anticipate that this one will continue. So for the long term, just no change. TSMC will continue to work closely with the customer. We'll devote our resources into R&D, and we are pursuing the manufacturing excellency. Affecting the fab, to build a fab in U.S., I'll let Mark to make some comments. Well, we do the long-term planning always to the interest of TSMC. And currently, this U.S. fab planning is more to, for the long term, tap global talent for TSMC rather than the risk management because we think this COVID-19 is an impact on human being, mankind, but it's a once in a century. And I think we'll learn to deal with COVID-19 as a global community and while keep our supply chain cost effective and efficient at the same time. So that is what I think. So there's no abrupt decision change because of COVID-19 regarding this fab construction. Does that answer your questions, Bill? Yes. The next question is from the line of Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. I want to ask about the 5G smartphone. So management mentioned that 5G total smartphone growth was revised on the total smartphone shipment, but the penetration with 5G remain unchanged. So can you tell us what -- with this COVID-19 world current situation, any product mix shifts when you do the revision? Or why is that high-end 5G phone or low-end smartphones, their decline is the same? Why does the penetration remain unchanged? And in addition, do you see that 5G smartphone penetration in different geographies, do you see any changes when you do this revision? Okay. Bruce, sorry, let me repeat your question to make sure we understand. Your question is on the 5G smartphone. As C.C. highlighted, we revised the total shipments down to a high single-digit decline, but why do we still maintain a mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphones? You want to know if we can talk about any product mix shifts that we see in these smartphone, for example, high end versus mid-end versus low end, and why our mid-teens has not changed, and also if we can add some detail or color by geography. All right. Let me answer the question first. We did roll down our expectation or our forecast on the smartphone, the total unit, by high single digit. However, we still see the penetration of the 5G smartphone at the same kind of mid-teens percentage. But the number of the 5G smartphone also reduced. Because of the same percentage with the total number being reduced, so the 5G phone also reduced. That's one thing. And what is the second question? And then Bruce wants to know, do we have any detail on between high, mid, low end or by geography. That's too much of the details, I cannot release the information. But let me say that 5G smartphone has been very, very popular and we expect that one to grow. Okay. Okay. Do you have any -- yes. I'll try to follow up on this because, for the first quarter, we definitely see that expensive or higher-priced smartphones, the sell-through is much weaker than the mid-end and lower end one. So that's why we are surprised that the penetration rate for the smartphones or 5g mobile remain unchanged. Do you have any version there to support the forecast? Well, there is a section named -- called 5G, right? And all I can say is that it's going to be very popular. I see. Okay. The second thing is that we have a lot of investor asking that, because of current situation, the end consumer, the demand is facing some correction. Why is that TSMC as a foundry supplier for anyone do not see a meaningful orders cut as of now? I mean why is that a cause to this kind of big time lag between the real end demand situation and production? Okay. Let me just repeat your question, Bruce. Your question is when you – no, investors are asking, when you look at the end consumer, you can see a very big correction. But why is TSMC not seeing any types of order cuts? Why is there a deviation between what we are seeing and the end market? For the big time lag, as management mentioned earlier, management also expect or prepared some orders cut in the second half. So the time lag between the production control and the consumer demand correction is more than three months of funnel. Why is that causing this delay? First, you are talking about TSMC's observation from the end market to TSMC's business. TSMC has a leadership in the technology. And we are ramping up the 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer, and that have been very popular and widely used by all the customer. And not every foundry offer this kind of a technology coverage, right? And so we are not -- we -- in our technology and our ramping up, we are not seeing any big effect yet. So that what’s some delay the end market to TSMC's business. But we do see that the end market is dropping, so we also expect some demand from TSMC's customer will be adjusted. However, in this COVID-19's impact, we do believe that TSMC will be less affected as compared with other countries. So do you expect the orders cut in the second half were more at the legacy node instead of our leading node that's why TSMC can be better than competitors? I would like to say yes, but let's wait and see. The next question is from the line of Sebastian Hou from CLSA. Your line is now open. First one, I'd like to follow on the CapEx. So historically when TSMC, if I’m still remembering this right, when TSMC -- every time when TSMC lower revenue guidance within a year, the CapEx will be adjusted lower accordingly. Even if just a 5% adjustment on the revenue, you also adjust the CapEx, sometimes even bigger than the revenue. This time -- it looks like this time, the revenue adjustment is as large as 8% or high single digit, but CapEx remained the same. So my question is, first, is it because like TSMC sees something very important, very big and very confirmed in the pipeline through the end of this year and to 2021 that you didn’t need to spend or no matter what? Or TSMC started moving on some flexibility here given that some equipment supplier or maybe one particular equipment supplier had a very long lead time and bargaining power, to some extent, and you are also fighting with the competitors starting to affect equipment visibility. So you don't want to cancel that at this point. Which one is more true? Okay, Sebastian. Let me summarize your question to make sure we understand. Your question is on our CapEx. And your question is that, while we have our full year outlook, we have adjusted versus what we said in January, we are reaffirming our CapEx guidance of January. So you want to know why are we not adjusting our CapEx or because our full year outlook has been adjusted. And you propose two reasons. Is it because, a, we have confirmed customer demand profile that goes into 2021 and beyond so that's why we continue to invest? Or is it, b, that certain of our equipment suppliers may have a very strong bargaining power so we have no choice, so to speak, but to continue to spend because our equipment supplier has a strong position? Is that correct? Exactly. Sebastian, as we mentioned earlier, that we are looking at this megatrend, multiple year of megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications. And this trend continues. The demand for our advanced technology will continue. Most of the CapEx that we spend this year is for the growth of next year and beyond. And that is the reason that we are reaffirming our CapEx numbers at this moment. To a certain extent, it may tend to go with your number one options, option a. I think that's quite clear. Do you have... Okay. Yes, okay. So my second question is I think, last quarter, the Company gave us some guidance about your four major platforms: HPC, mobile growing 20%-plus, IoT, auto growing mid-teens. Can you give us an update now? Okay. So Sebastian, you want to know what is our updated forecasts for the four growth platforms for 2020. For the whole year? Yes, for this year. Okay. Smartphone and HPC platform growth will be slightly higher than the corporate average. IoT will be similar, and automotive will be below corporate average. Those are all in U.S. dollar terms. Okay. Does that answer your question, Sebastian -- yes. Okay. All right. You have answered it, but I have to follow on this one, if I may, that the smartphone is still above the corporate average. So that means this market will still grow mid- to high teens. And so I think with -- the TSMC forecasts the smartphone shipment to decline high single digit, so this year, so which means that the content imply that content increase for TSMC is, on my head, like 20%-plus this year in total. Is that right? You have a very good calculation, and you are right. The next question is from Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. So I have two questions. One is more short term and another one is a long term, maybe even 1- or 2-years later. So first of all, if I compare your guidance versus the previous forecast, it seems like order cuts reflects through to your third quarter revenues. So do you think, this year, the third quarter revenue is going to be sub seasonal, I mean, in terms of Q-on-Q growth? And the 7-nanometer was pretty tight at the beginning of the year… Charlie, we cannot hear you clearly. Can you please move closer to the phone line and start. We couldn't hear your first question. Please repeat it. Okay. I actually used a [indiscernible] so let me try again. So first question is about your third quarter revenues. Do you expect the quarter is going to be sub seasonal? And as you mentioned order cuts, do you still see 7-nanometer capacity is in shortage in 3Q? Okay. So Charlie is asking a short-term question on third quarter. Do we expect our revenue to be -- third quarter revenue to be sub seasonal? Do we expect 7-nanometer to remain full for third quarter? Charlie, we're not giving out the guidance for the third quarter yet, and it's still early, especially under this uncertain environment. We will have a clearer picture in July and share with you. Okay. What's your second question, Charlie? Okay. Yes, it's really linked to that. I guess investors also -- I want to know more your internal scenario analysis about COVID-19 impact. I think in your opening remarks you mentioned the COVID situation, the virus to peak in June, but there seems to be some signs of a second-wave outbreak globally. So in a change of the COVID scenario, what would be the -- TSMC's growth in 2020? And by the way, the second question is very simple on 3-nanometer. Do you expect customer number and demand in 3-nanometer can compare to you what you have in 5-nanometer. So two questions are those. Okay. That's a little more than 2, but okay. Let me just repeat your two questions. One, you want to know our internal scenario for COVID-19. We had said and C.C. had said that if not stabilized by June, what if it's worse, what happens to our forecast. That's number one.
And then number two, for 3-nanometer, what is our customer -- number of customers and the demand profile as compared to 5-. Okay. Let me answer the second question first under the 3-nanometer, all right. 3-nanometer, as I said, we are -- our technology development is on track and we are working with customers to further define the specs and then define the technologies. So -- as which one, I cannot say, but there is -- again, I can share with you is in mobile phone and HPC-related applications.
Now the first one, we are talking about the impact of COVID-19 and we are giving our forecast based on the COVID-19 will be stabilized, the impact or the spread over will be stabilizing in June. What happens if it's longer than that? I don't know. I mean that's -- if it's longer than that, the macro economy will be much worse than we thought and definitely will affect the semiconductor industry, will affect the foundry industry and certainly also will affect the TSMC. But we don't know yet. Let's be hopeful that all the human being will be safe and healthy and everything stabilizing in June. Okay. Thank you, C.C. The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open. Yes. Want to go back to your comment about gross margin trend in the second half of 2020. You highlighted the fact that the mix would have adverse impact by as much as several point. Want to get your view of your flexibility in case coronavirus impact would be more than just one quarter. What can you do to better manage utilization rate and therefore minimize the gross margin impact to only a couple of percentage points? And I have a follow-up. Okay. Mehdi, let me repeat your question. You're asking about our second half gross margin outlook. When -- our CFO has already highlighted the two factors impacting our second half gross margin.
You want to know what if COVID-19 worsens, what measures can we further take to better manage -- or can we do things to better manage our utilization rate to better support or help our gross margin? Okay. Generally speaking, if the COVID-19 impacts prolongs, we will expect a lower utilization. At the same time, what we have done before, and we may be able to do the same, is to prebuild some of the products that our customer said they will be looking for to receive. That's one way of minimizing the impact. Do you have a second question, Mehdi? Yes, yes. Just as a follow-up, if you were to prebuild for your customer and customers' own demand starts to weaken, then perhaps customers' orders beyond second half, looking into the first half of next year, could be adversely impacted. So maybe the adverse impact of a more prolonged coronavirus would have a gross margin downside into next year, into 2021, due to the fact that you're prebuilding for customers. Okay. So Mehdi, your question is a follow-up to Wendell. If we prebuild, but the customer demand continues to weaken or worsen, then won't that create more issues for TSMC in 2021. When we prebuild, we are pretty sure that the customers will take it. Yes, the demand would be there. Does that answer your question? Yes. Okay. Yes. All right. Thank you. The next question is from Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Your line is now open. I just had a question on your second half implied outlook. I think it's for down 3% revenue just backing out what you said about Q2 and what you delivered in Q1. Now you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen no major order cuts as yet. But if I just step back and look at your Q1, TSMC just posted smartphone sales growth up 50% year-on-year in smartphones when smartphone demand is negative. Your China business in Q1 is up almost 80% year-on-year. And your biggest customer in China, Huawei, has posted inventories up 75% in 2019.
So just looking at all this, maybe fabless customers are not building inventory per se, but it's clear that the end customer, the OEMs, seem to be significantly stockpiling and they're not cutting orders yet. So given all this, I'm just wondering how big you think the stockpiling is at present further up the food chain and why it won't lead to a more material decline in your second half outlook than you're suggesting. Okay, Brett. So your question is basically when -- you're saying that if you look at our first quarter business, there's a large increase year-on-year in our smartphone, in our revenue from China and increased at certain -- Huawei has seen an increase in their inventory year-on-year as well. So your question is, how to reconcile this with TSMC's business outlook. But let me remind you, last year, 2019 first quarter, if you're looking first quarter year-on-year, where our business was impacted by photoresist, so it's not an apples-to-apples. But your question. Right? So basically, the first quarter of this year, we see inventory increase in our fabless customers and we expect that to continue to rise because of this COVID-19 impact. It will start to digest in the second half. Does that answer your question, Brett? Well, just to understand better how you're thinking about this because we haven't seen an inventory buildup like this at the OEM level for some years, and I just wanted to understand how big you think this is at the moment at the end customer. We -- this is a very uncertain time. We don't want to quantify the numbers at this moment, but it is building and it's above the last year's year-end level. The next question is from Frank Lee from HSBC. Your line is now open. So I had two questions. My first question is more on just a bit of housekeeping related to your previous guidance you gave. I think back in January, you had guided for foundry growth to be up 17% excluding Samsung's captive supply. But you just gave a new guidance for the year. Is that an apple-to-apple? Are you including Samsung or not including Samsung in that number? Not including Samsung if it’s apple-to-apples comparison. Okay. So not including -- okay. And then the second question I had, you've also talked a bit -- quite a bit on this call about the work from home driving your HPC business, I guess, stronger than -- continue to drive that business. But outside of HPC, have you seen -- well, I guess maybe this is related as well, what about just overall if you extend it to the overall PC market, are you seeing some signs of stronger than expected? And could we see potentially stronger-than-expected PC market for this year as a result of this trend? We saw the demand from tablets has been increasing. That's what we saw. And the PC, probably flattish and on the gaming console increased. That's so far today that we observed. Okay? Okay. And also just to -- as C.C. said, both our forecast for foundry in January and today are including Samsung. So it's apples-to-apples, just to make that clear. Next is from [Kiki Apiro] from [Principal]. Your line is now open. Just like to understand a bit more about your virus assumptions there. You said that you are assuming the virus will stabilize in June. Can you translate the virus assumption stabilizing in June into handset demand. How much are you looking at handset demand for 2Q and 3Q? Okay. So your question is under our assumptions for COVID-19, what is our assumption for the handset demand in 2Q and 3Q? We gave you a whole year's assumption, but I cannot be more specific. 2Q, let's say the seasonality -- every year's seasonality, the smartphone actually decrease, all right, and start to bounce back in third quarter and the fourth quarter. But how many units, I cannot to be so specific to share with you. Okay. Does that answer -- do you have a second question? The foundry content increase impact is mainly throughout the year or more towards the second half, that's the last question. He's asking the silicon content increase for 5G. Is it throughout the year? Or is it mainly in the second half of this year? It's in the 5G for the year, I can say. Yes. So throughout the year.
Okay. Let's move on to the next caller. I believe it's a follow-up question from Gokul at JPMorgan, please. So first of all, could you talk -- I mean, just maybe stepping away from COVID-19, hopefully, we all can soon. So in the past downturns, we've seen meaningful IDM outsourcing happen. I think if I think about GFC, we had multiple current customers of TSMC give up leading-edge and move to TSMC. How should we think about -- or how is TSMC thinking about the potential for further IDM outsourcing over the next 2 to 3 years as we get through this process, which will potentially put some pressure on some of the potential IDMs as well?
And a related question is, I think Mark has answered in the past about potential M&A opportunities. Do we consider overseas fab acquisition as a right strategy for TSMC to -- if it comes with a meaningful customer attached to it? I know that TSMC has not really done any meaningful fab acquisitions for a long time, I think probably 2000 was the last meaningful one with [WaferTech]. Just wanted to understand how the management team thinks about fab acquisition as a potential strategy or any thoughts around that. Okay. So Gokul, you have two questions. One is on the IDM outsourcing and then do we see the further potential for further IDM outsourcing under this environment in the next few years.
And the second part of your question refers to our potential M&A. And your question is that in terms of an overseas fab acquisition, will we consider an overseas fab acquisition if meaningful customer business were to be attached to it? Well, let me answer the IDM outsourcing question first. The current downturn might further accelerate the outsourcing for IDMs, but we don't know yet. However, in the long term, IDM outsourcing will continue as the foundry model has proven to be an economic win-win situation for both foundry and its customer. That, as we said, we expect this one continue to happen. This is a long-term strategy. Yes. Let me answer the second question about the overseas fab acquisition. We do have continued scouting about the possible fab, but those are mostly only mature fabs, and we don't exclude the possibility, but it all depends on the investment and return. If it economically makes sense, then we go ahead. But it's also -- it's very challenging for the mature fab to be, again, financially viable so far we see. So we still continue evaluating.
But overseas fab acquisition is unlikely to be a leading fab because our leading fab is a technology with very sophisticated complexity. And also, there is none of the fab can perform like a TSMC's fab with -- it's really a service body, technical service body. Instead of the structured facility or equipment, our fab really is a technical service body. That has to be built. And therefore, that challenged us to build -- to acquire a leading-edge fab overseas. Okay. Does that answer your question? That's very helpful. Next is from Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. So these are some questions that I want to get whether management has few thoughts, for example, not about inquiring but any plan to build an establishment in the U.S. So that is my first question.
I also want to get some clarification because the recent research is showing China fab like SMIC is gaining share and I can see that makes some sense because China is pursuing localization. So what's the management forecast for your local market share in China? And what's your strategy for -- to protect your China market share? Okay. So you have two questions, Charlie. One is what is our plans for a fab in the U.S. -- to build a fab in the U.S.?
And then, secondly, you're asking about China, that SMIC is gaining market share. There's increased localization. So what is TSMC's share outlook for China and strategy to protect ourselves? Okay. Let me answer the first question regarding U.S. fab. We are now actively evaluating the U.S. fab plain. And -- but as I told the investor before, there is a cost gap, which is hard to accept at this point. Of course, we have -- we are doing a lot of things to reduce that cost gap. One of the -- there are two obstacle currently is -- under actively evaluating is if we do a U.S. fab, it will have to be a leading-edge fab or at least close to leading-edge fab. And the supply chain for the leading-edge fab, at this point, it appears that we need to also establish at the same time. And currently, we are surveying our supply chain partners, whether they will be able to go along so that the quality of the material to support a leading-edge fab can be cost-effective in U.S.
And secondly, of course, as I planning -- said earlier, this fab has to be engineering service body. It is -- in fact, Taiwan, all the fab are very highly technical people. In the fab, all master degree and above. And we try to duplicate that in the U.S., it takes a lot of planning and organization to be able to enable such a fab. So -- but there are -- as I said, there are opportunities for us in there. We tried -- hopefully, we can better tap the global talent for TSMC for the long term, expanding a new site in U.S. All right, Jeff, would you repeat the second question? Sure. The second question is that how do we view the competition in the market in China? Charlie points out that he believes SMIC is gaining share and there's increasing trend of localization. What is TSMC’s strategy? Okay. I don't think that the SMIC is gaining share, to answer your question first. TSMC has been very competitive. In everywhere, we are -- everybody is a foundry. In every location, we offer the best technology, best service. We're working with customers closely. So we are pretty successful in gaining market share rather than just losing the market share, let me say that.
And specifically, for China's foundry, we're also very competitive because of a lot of China customers have been working with TSMC. I know that SMIC has been very aggressive, but so far, we are competing very well. That's all I can say. Okay. Thank you. Operator, I believe -- thank you, Charlie. Operator, let's move on to the last question from Sebastian at CLSA. So I have two follow-up. First one, I just want to double check that if I hear you correctly, I think C.C. already mentioned that you have reserved the high numbers of tapeout on N5 versus N7 at the same stage. Is that right? That's right. Okay. So if my note is correct, then in the year one manufacturing, the year one mass production for 7-, you have 30-plus tapeout on 7- and recent entry you have 50-plus and then you're going to like 100-something. So I think this year is year one for five. So we can say that you have 30-plus 5-nanometer tapeout at this point. Well, I'm not willing to release the actual number. But all I can say is now in N5, we have a customer from -- smartphone customer from HPC-related area, okay? And the activity, actually we saw more tapeouts as compared with the same period of N7 because the N5 actually is complicated, and I would believe that customer will take more time to work with TSMC as early as possible. That's what we are thinking. Okay. Okay. Do you expect N5 to be potentially bigger than N7 in terms of the capacity? Yes. Certainly, we expect that. Okay. On the capacity-wise, not revenue, capacity. Oh, on the capacity-wise, we'll say no comment right now. I'm going to say, let’s say, the two -- first two years out. We don't comment on the capacity by nodes, Sebastian. But as C.C. said, N5 would be a very big node. Do you have a second question? Yes. Second question is I remember I think -- most of the time, I think in the past few months as well, we or the media ask about -- ask TSMC questions about like U.S. potential further sanction on Huawei or China on technological side. I think TSMC always -- I think most of the time your answer is that, that is not official in terms of the data can no longer answer any hypothetical questions. But I feel like -- I think this time TSMC, the Company is addressing the questions very clearly although there is no official announcement yet and there's no official answer yet. So am I interpreting that or feeling that right, that it seems like your -- the risk or possibility of this potential sanction is higher or it indicate to something else? Okay. Sebastian, let me just make sure we understand your question correctly. So your question is on the potential rule changes from the U.S. that reading news reports in the past, that TSMC has always said we don't comment on hypothetical, but you see today maybe our comments -- you're asking if our comments today reflect a change in the tone or the view even though nothing -- no official rule change has been announced. Well, yes, there's no official rules yet announced. But just to let you know, the U.S. semiconductor community societies wrote multiple letters to the White House as well as the Commerce Department urging this rule not to be changed. So we do sense there is an urgency from the industry that having that rule change will hurt the U.S. semiconductor community, and we share the same feeling. Okay. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within four hours from now. The transcript will be available in 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay healthy and safe, and hope -- we hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and please have a good day. Thank you. Goodbye.","TSMC is hosting its earnings conference call via live audio webcast . the format for today's event will be as follows . tsmc's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will provide the opening remarks .",1.0

And now, I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was flat sequentially, as the continued 5G infrastructure deployment and HPC related product launches offset weaknesses in other platforms. Gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points sequentially to 53%, mainly due to continuing high level of utilization and the absence of unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, partially offset by NT$ appreciation in the second quarter.
Total operating expenses increased by NT$1.19 billion, mainly as TSMC supported a range of COVID-19 relief efforts. Operating margin increased by 0.8 percentage points sequentially to 42.2%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was NT$4.66 and ROE was 28.5%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 7 nano process technology contributed 36% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 16 nanometer contributed 18%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16 nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of wafer revenue.
Moving onto revenue contribution by platform, smartphones decreased 4% quarter-over-quarter to account for 47% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 12% to account for 33%. IoT decreased 5% to account for 8%. Automotive decreased 13% to account for 4%. Digital consumer electronics decreased 9% to account for 5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT$605 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by NT$25 billion, mainly due to the increase of NT$30 billion in short-term loans. On financial ratios accounts receivables turnover days increased 2 days to 44 days. Days of inventory also increased 2 days to 55 days mainly due to N5 ramp and stronger N7 demand.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated above NT$170 billion in cash from operations, spent NT$127 billion in CapEx and distributed NT$65 billion for third quarter cash dividend. We also increased NT$30 billion in short-term loans and issued NT$36 billion of corporate bonds. Overall, our cash balance increased NT$37 billion to NT$468 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures amounted to US$4.2 billion.
I finished my financial summary. Now, let's turn to our third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between US$11.2 billion and US$11.5 billion, which represents a 9.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of US$1 to NT$29.5 gross margin is expected to be between 50% and 52%, operating margin between 39% and 41%.
Now, I will hand over the call to CC for his key messages. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of NT$310.7 billion or US$10.4 billion in line with our guidance given three months ago.
Our second quarter business increased slightly in U.S. dollar terms as continued 5G infrastructure deployment and HPC related portal launches offset weakness in other platforms. Moving into third quarter 2020, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer technologies, driven by 5G smartphone, HPC and IoT related applications.
Looking at the second half of this year, COVID-19 continues to bring some level of disruption to the global economies and uncertainty remained. We have observed weak consumer demand in the first half of this year and now expect global smartphone units to declined low teens percentage year-over-year in 2020. However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we also observed the supply chain making efforts to ensure supply chain security and actively preparing for new 5G smartphone launches.
We raised our forecast for 5G smartphone penetration rate to high teens percentage of the total smartphone market in 2020. For the full year of 2020, 5G and HPC related applications will continue to drive semiconductor content enrichment. We now forecast overall semiconductor market, excluding memory growth, to be flat to slightly increased, while foundry industry growth is expected to increase to be mid-to-high-teens percentage.
For TSMC also COVID-19 related uncertainties remain. Our technology leadership position enables us to outperform the foundry revenue growth. We believe we can grow above 20% in 2020 in US dollar terms, including the impact from the new U.S. regulations, which I will discuss in the next sheet [ph]. Our 2020 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer technologies and our specialty technology solutions, driven by customers of 5G smartphone related product launches and expanding HPC related opportunities.
Now let me talk about the impact of new U.S. regulations. On May 15, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a set of new export control regulations. As a global and law-abiding company, TSMC will follow all the rules and regulations fully, no doubt about it. While there may be some impact from the new U.S. regulations, TSMC's propose to unleash innovation remained unchanged. Our leading position in the semiconductor industry [indiscernible] on our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and customers' trust also remained unchanged.
We will continue to build upon our opportunities of strength and conduct our business with integrity to ensure our value and contribute to the semiconductor industry. In the near-term we will work dynamically with our customers to minimize the impact to our business from new U.S. regulations.
In the mid-to-long-term, we believe the underlying megatrend of 5G related and HPC applications remained intact, and supply chain can adjust and rebalance themselves. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture all the mid-to-long-term growth opportunities. We reaffirm our goal to grow at the high end of our long-term growth projection of 5% to 10% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our N5 ramp up and N4 introduction. N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with best PPA. N5 is already in volume production with good yield, while we continue to improve the productivity and performance of the EUV tools. We are seeing robust demand for N5 and expect a strong ramp of N5 in the second half of this year, driven by both 5G smartphones and HPC applications. As we observed some delays earlier this year in N5 toward deliveries due to COVID-19, we now expect 5 nanometer to contribute about 8% of our wafer revenue in 2020.
We also introduced N4 as an exchanging of our 5 nanometer family. N4 [indiscernible] have comparable design rules [ph] and a highly competitive performance tool cost advantages as compared to N5, and we are targeting next wave of N5 products. Volume production is targeted for 2022. Thus we are confident that our 5 nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with about 70% larger density gain, 10% to 15% speed gain, and 25% to 30% power improvement as compared with 5 nanometer. Our industry technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost. Our industry technology development is on track with good progress. N3 which production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022.
We have already demonstrated to handle 56 mega [indiscernible] from [indiscernible]. N3 documented test is fully functional we see ahead of plan. The device performance is also on track. Our 3 nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in most PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced which will also extend our leadership position well into the future.
Finally, let me talk about our U.S. fab plan. On May 15, we announced our intention to build an advanced semiconductor fab in the U.S. We have received a commitment to support this project from both, the U.S. Federal Government and the State of Arizona. We are working closely with them as well as our supply chain partners to build an effective supply chain and make up the cost scale. This fab will start with 5 nanometer technology with 20,000 wafers per month capacity. Production is targeted to begin in 2024. The U.S. trade war [ph] enabled TSMC to expand our technology ecosystem and better service our customers and partners. At the same time, as TSMC global presence increases, it will allow us to better reach global talent to sustain our technology leadership.
Now let me turn the microphone over to our CFO. Thank you, CC. Let me start by making some comments on our second half profitability outlook. We have just guided third quarter 2020 gross margin to decline by 2 percentage points sequentially to 51% at the midpoint, primarily due to the margin dilution from the initial ramp up of our 5 nanometer technology in the third quarter and a less favorable foreign exchange rate.
As compared with our expectations three months ago, our third quarter gross margin midpoint is higher, mainly supported by a high level of overall capacity utilization despite the uncertainty from COVID-19. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a continued steep ramp up of our 5 nanometer to dilute our fourth quarter gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. While the impact of COVID-19 virus brings uncertainties in 2020, we have seen our business holding up well so far. Thanks to our technology leadership of 5 and 7 nanometer nodes. Looking ahead, the multi-year megatrends of 5G related and HPC applications are expected to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years.
In order to meet this demand and support our customers' capacity needs, we have decided to raise our full year 2020 CapEx to be between US$16 to US$17 billion. We also reiterate that TSMC is committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
That concludes my key messages. Thank you, Wendell. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all participants an opportunity to ask questions. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Instructions] Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line. Yes, thank you. The first to ask questions, Gokul Hariharan, J.P. Morgan. Go ahead please. Yes, hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions and great results in a tough time. Just a quick question on how we think about N3 development? Do we feel that N3, since we talk about mass production in the second half of 2022, usually then you don’t start sometime in Q2, I just wanted to understand, are we thinking about a slightly slower ramp for N3, compared to what we have had in the first year for N5 as well as N7? That is my first question.
My second question is, when you think about leading edge once the U.S. regulation starts to come in, how do we think about managing capacity? Do we feel that the capacity can get filled up relatively quickly when one of our leading customers, you have just talked [ph] to them, or do we feel that there could be a couple of, there could be some time where there could be a little bit of under utilization? Okay, thank you Gokul. Let me try to, allow me to summarize your question. Your first question is related to N3, how do we think about the N3 development? We have said the mass production timing is in second half 2022 versus typically the second quarter, so should we expect a slightly lower ramp of N3? This is your first question. Okay, let me answer that Gokul. In fact we develop our new leading edge technology. We work closely with our customer. So, the schedule and also the ramp up, also the progress we are all working with customer closely and determine when and to be the best of timing. So far, N3 development is very smooth and successful, and we still target the rich production in next year and ramp up in the second half. There is all the schedules, it is working with our customers. Okay, and then Gokul, your second question is on the leading edge, and in light of the recent U.S. regulations how will we manage our capacity at the leading edge? Will we see a gap in the utilization, or will we be able to fill it up? We should be no problem because as we just stated that the 5G is a megatrend and also HPC related applications continue to be very strong. And we observed that all our customers are very actively prepared for these two applications 5G and HPC. In addition to that, we also observed that all our customers are trying to secure their supply chain security, and which is very important, with this COVID-19 uncertainty. Do we feel that even for N5 that is applicable or… Yes, even with N5, yes. Let me answer that. I think for the short-term some impact is inevitable. Currently, we work closely with our customer very dynamically trying to fill up the capacity. And for the long-term, as CC mentioned, we are very, we are still optimistic. Okay, thank you Gokul. Can we have the next caller, please? Next question is from Sebastian Hou, CLSA. Go ahead please. Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first one is, I wanted to get some, get your brain about how do you evaluate the feasibility and probability of building up advanced new fab without American content, be it technology equivalent IP material et cetera in the next five years or 10 years or even longer? Does it work or even if it take a long time instrumented efforts would SMC ever consider that? Thank you. Well, let me answer that question. We know that the U.S. fab as compared with the fab in Taiwan, the cost structure is actually little bit higher and that's why we say that we are working with Federal Government and also the State of Arizona, due to close okay? Yes, sorry. Just to repeat the question. I think Sebastian's question is asking about building up an advance node fab or production line without using any so called American content, whether in terms of equipment, technology, or IP materials. He wants to know in the next five to 10 years, is it feasible? Is it worth it? And is this something that TSMC would consider? Let me pick up this one here. The semiconductor technology is very unique in this industry. The technology continued to improve, every two years, you'll be a new generation of technology come out to serve the best performance product. And therefore, we I think our main force is still pursuing the technology leadership, trying to overcome each generation's challenge.
And to do that, I think our current focus still working with our equipment partners, dealing with utilize the best of the kind equipments, that we can have, to pursue our business growth. So, you're right, if we do that otherwise, technology advancement will be extremely challenging. It will be extremely difficult, not to talk about 5 to 10 years alone. So that is not our current effort at this point. Okay, Sebastian. Do you have a second question? Yes, yes, thank you for that very clear one. Second question is I'd like to follow about the payment situation. The first, can you update us on how you see the fabless data inventory at the end of Q2 and how you see that in the second half of this year?
And also on the inventory side, it looks like it is getting increasingly difficult to get the inventory from a comprehensive perspective, fabless DOI [ph] may not be enough because apparently there's a lot of the Chinese companies stockpile the inventory in fear of being sanctioned and also across the board globally, the whole supply chain has been raising the stakes or level of inventory in the past few months a fear of supply the disruption caused by COVID-19.
So, but those are not reflected in fables DOI [ph]. So, how do we see about this inventory and potentially hidden excessive inventory situation going forward? Did you consider about that to be a potential [indiscernible] and at some point the destocking could come. Thank you. Okay, let me summarize your second question Sebastian, both of it relates to the inventory situation. The first part is, what is in for TSMC tracking our fabless customers? What is the fabless DOI exiting to queue and the outlook into second half? That's the first part of your question.
And then the second part of your question is, are we concerned that the inventory situation may see some hidden or discrepancies due to whether it's COVID related supply chain disruption, or the U.S. regulation and such, will this lead to a hidden inventory risk, and is there a risk of inventory correction? Let me answer that. The inventory level of our fabless customers that we track exited first quarter above the seasonal level. We expect a further increase in second quarter, and then stay at the high level in the second half as the supply chain is making efforts to ensure supply chain security and our customers are in high anticipation and preparing for new 5G smartphone product launches in the second half of this year.
We cannot rule out the possibility of an inventory correction sometime down the road. We observe the supply chain active, making efforts to ensure the securities, and active preparation for 5G smartphone launches. We will just have to wait and see how the sell-through goes. Okay, thank you Sebastian. Can we move on to the next caller please? Operator, please move on to the next caller. Thank you. The next caller is Bill Lu from UBS. Go ahead, please. Yes, hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can comment on the CapEx guidance for this year, it's now raised to 16 billion to 17 billion. I'm wondering what that increase is, whether it's 5 nanometer or something different?
Secondly, related to that, can you talk about your CapEx intensity structurally whether this is, this increase is temporary and whether this is pull of in front from [indiscernible] for maintaining the dollar driven intensity or how we should think about that? Thanks. Okay, let me summarize your two questions Bill. Your first question is in relation to our 2020 CapEx guidance and the range of 16 billion to 17 billion. So, Bill wants to know what is driving this increase? And then secondly, in terms of the capital intensity outlook over the next few years? Okay. The CapEx increase from three months ago for this year is basically comes from the advanced technologies, and the capital intensity this year will be slightly lower than 40% and over the long-term, it will gradually go down to above mid-30s. Okay, thank you, Bill. Let's move on to the next caller, please? Operator? The next caller is Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Go ahead please. Yes, thanks very much. I wanted to ask about your relationship with Huawei and how you see the impact of the U.S. regulation on your business with Huawei in the second half of the year. My understanding is that you will still have a relation - you will still be shipping wafers, probably at elevated levels in Q3. So can you confirm whether or not you'll have any sales with Huawei in Q4? And in a note how do you manage your 5 nanometer utilization, given the importance of Huawei as a customer? Thank you. Okay. Let me summarize your question, Brett, is regard to the relationship with Huawei, but wants to know what is the impact on our business from Huawei in the second half of this year? Will we continue to ship wafers to this customer in the fourth quarter? If we do not, then how will we manage the impact to our 5 nanometer? Okay, let me answer your question. As CC just reported we are complying fully with all the regulation and we did not take any new orders or production starts from this customer since May 15. Although this regulation is just finished their public common period, the BIS has not, did a final ruling change at this point and so it's very early, still early to confirm.
But under this current status we do not planning to ship wafers after September 14. And yes, there will be a challenge to work dynamically with other customers, thus currently we're working with them. And, but as you heard, we made a - CC Just made our 2020s guidance is above 20%. That tells you we are relatively progressing well in filling up the left - capacity left open. Okay, Brett. Thank you. Do you have a second question? Yes, thanks Jeff. Just a follow-up and I wanted to ask about depreciation for this year. I think previously you've talked about mid-to-high teen growth of this depreciation in 2020. Can you confirm whether that's still the case? And I look at the first half depreciation and it looks like depreciation costs are down year-on-year. So in order to get to the mid-to-high teens growth, that would imply a large increase in depreciation in the third and fourth quarter. So if you can just clarify exactly how we should think about depreciation for the next couple of quarters that would be great? Thank you. Okay, Brett is asking his second question is our depreciation outlook for 2020, do we still maintain, what is our depreciation for 2020 year-on-year, and then does this imply a pickup in depreciation in the second half on a quarterly basis? Okay, Brett our current estimate on 2020 depreciation year-on-year growth is still high teens growth. So that gives you an idea of what the second half depreciation will be. It will be higher than the first half. Thank you. Okay, thank you, Brett. Can we have the next question on the line, please? The next one on the line is Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please ask your question. Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to your N4 and N3, and how should we think about the migration and specifically to what extent it is driven by converting rather than installing new equipment? And I have a followup. Okay, sorry Mehdi. Let me make sure we understood your first question. You're asking about N4 and N3, how to think about the migration and is there a conversion, tool conversion involved between N4 and N3? Is that your question? Correct. Okay. All right, actually the N4 is kind of improvement, continuous improvement from N5, so it has improves the speed, improved geometry just a little bit. N3 is totally new node alright? So that’s N4 used in the same equipment as N5. N3 we expect to have a high percentage of the tool continue to be used from the N5, but N3 is a totally new node. Okay, thank you. Do you have a second question Mehdi? Yes and my second question has to do with your HPC revenue growth in Q2 you were significantly higher compared to Q1 within the - and can you please elaborate which specific sub segment within HPC is doing better, is it driven by communication or computer and how do you see those trends trending into Q3? So Mehdi, your second question is looking at our HPC sequential growth in the second quarter, Mehdi wants to know what specific sub segments are driving that increase and what is the outlook? Well Mehdi, I don't think we - we want to breakdown the details on the different platforms. Sorry about that. Okay, Mehdi? The concern is that maybe perhaps Huawei may have pulled in before you stopped taking orders and I'm trying to understand how that particular customer has computed wafer in the first half versus second half? Sorry Mehdi, no we don’t comment on specific customer. Okay, thank you Mehdi. Thank you Thank you. Can we have the next caller on the line, please operator? Yes. Next one Randy Abrams from Crédit Suisse. Go ahead please. Okay, yes. Thank you. My first question, I wanted to ask a bit more on the CapEx rates as that’s more of a function of what you mentioned the forward demand outlook. If you could give a view on 2021, I know it’s in early stage, we just factoring a full year, how we mentioned Huawei and also mentioned potential, but you don't rule out an inventory correction, and it does seem like Samsung and this is discussing a bit about some graphics and high-end smartphone business, some [indiscernible] like it is the - the CapEx rate is what’s driving it, if there are certain drivers that may be lifted on the 2021, how you’re seeing that and implication is it follows up on Bill Lu’s question, but implication for 2021 if it’s impact it might be a bit lower CapEx that you are spending at a bit head of that now. Okay, so Randy, let me summarize your first question. Your first question is really, what is driving our rates for the 2020 CapEx? What is the drivers for that? And then what is the outlook for 2021 CapEx? CapEx and sales, the sales just factored in your comments about inventory. If your competitor is taking a bit of a sound [ph] business and also your view that we could have a - or don't rule out the inventory adjustment? Let me discuss, CapEx is a - we do the CapEx based on long-term perspective. If you talk about '20, this year's CapEx, mainly of course this shows our demand of N5 is very strong. And if you talk about the next year's CapEx, is really talk about 2022's demand, which we see the continued increase of N5 demand and also we see them starting the launch of N3 technology. And will see by then, how much the CapEx will increase and we will report to you in due time. Okay. Do you have a second question, Randy? Yes, and if I could follow up because you mentioned, like to the higher CapEx for this year is a function that you expect next year to be even stronger. So could you talk a bit about when - I know you talked about the megatrends, but I'm curious if you're thinking about just what you mentioned also, could next year have impact from the high base this year on the inventory build-up? And also you have a full year, like in the first quarter far ways out, there's probably pent-up demand being tight. But how do you view a full year if you're not shipping the following, unless you're counting on by that point some partial license to work in your base case you're assuming not shipping to Huawei by next year? Okay, Randy's second question. He wants to - he is thinking that with potential possibility of inventory correction with the U.S. regulations will that impact - what is the impact to 2021 growth outlook and CapEx? Yes, Randy. It's just too early for us to discuss anything about 2021. So we'll just wait until when the time approaches. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Let's move on to the next caller please. The next one is Roland Shu from Citigroup. Please ask the question. Hi, there, good afternoon. First question is, can you remind me again how does the inventory ratio adjustment work every quarter? How about the 3Q, if based on your inventory ratio adjustment favorable or unfavorable to the gross margin? This is my first question. Second question, which is you talked about that you are working with top customer to minimize the impact of the U.S. new regulation and how are you going to – are working on that? Thanks. Okay. So, Roland your two questions. Your first question is, what is the impact of inventory revaluation and then in the third quarter will it be a favorable or unfavorable impact? And your second question is, you want to know how we are dynamically working with customers to mitigate the impact of the new U.S. regulation? Roland, let me make some comments on the inventory valuation adjustment first. The impact on margins from inventory valuation adjustment is inversely correlated to that from changes in utilization. We normally report the net impact on margins from these two factors together. We will compare margins quarter-over-quarter, we will report the Q-on-Q change in impact from inventory valuation adjustments when it is more significant.
In the second quarter, the quarter-over-quarter change and impact from inventory valuation adjustments was more significant. And if you ask about third quarter, at this moment, we believe the impact is less significant. Okay. And then asking about how we work customers dynamically to mitigate the impact of Huawei ban, I cannot tell you that how we are going to do it because this is our company's strategy and our strength, but one thing I can tell you we are based on the technology leadership and the excellent manufacturing. That's all we did. Okay, thank you. Operator, can we move on to the next caller please? Yes. The next question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Hi, good afternoon, management team. So, my first question is really about your upward revision of the full year revenue guidance. So compared to last time, it was a mid-to-high-teen percent and now it is above 20%. I think this is a lift of 5 percentage points of revenue growth in 2020. But last time your assumption is that the pandemic can get controlled by June and now generally there is a second wave of the pandemic in many countries. So how are you going to reconcile this kind of weak economy or a healthcare-related issue versus your very strong revenue guidance? Should I just attribute that to the higher 5G smartphone penetration or there are other factors that we should pay attention to? Okay. Let me summarize your first question, Charlie. You are asking, basically we have increased the full-year outlook, but the risk of COVID-19 continues to remain. So how to reconcile a weak global economy with TSMC's full-year outlook and what will be driving this besides 5G smartphone preparation? Well, Charlie, we too observe the 5G's smartphone, the momentum is getting stronger, so we understand the situation. However, we also observed our customers are making efforts to ensure supply chain security. So they might expect there's a second wave, third wave of COVID-19, but since that end demand looks very promising, so they are not afraid to make sure that their supply chain will not be disrupted. Because of a 5G, as you just mentioned, 5G smartphones demand has continued to increase. Okay. Do you have a second question, Charlie? Yes, I do thanks. Thanks Jeff. So, I think a lot of things happened over the past months, right. And other - I would take it as a U-turn is your decision for the U.S. fab intention, because half-year ago I remember the comment was like the cost is pretty high, logistics doesn't makes sense. So what exactly is the trigger for you to change this U.S. operation decision?
And it will be very kind of you, if I can - had a very small question, because [indiscernible] as well, your first quarter seasonality, because based on your new full-year guidance, if we would take it as a 20% or 25% - 21% lower, the fourth quarter revenue may decline sequentially. Is that a kind of fair comment? Thank you. Okay. Well, Charlie your second question relates to our U.S. fab plant and you want to know why six months ago we were talking about the cost gap being the major challenge and now we have decided to go ahead. So what has changed? Yes. What's the trigger, yes. Well, as you know, with expanding our technology ecosystem and reach to global talent, closer to our customer and to get a better service, all benefits are the fab in U.S. But, in the past, indeed, the cost, the gap prohibited us to make those decisions. More recently, I think since last December and I think the things is getting a turn, and we did get the positive encouragement from the U.S. administration and about the cost gap, and actually they – U.S. administration and the State of Arizona combined, they do - they seems to be able to close the cost gap. We used to hold up against this decision with their commitment and we are preparing for that.
And how do they close the cost gap? As you have reading, we - the U.S. Congress both in Senate and the House are all driving for the incentive packages aimed at revive U.S semiconductor manufacturing. And with that, I think they do have a way to fulfill that commitment to make up the cost gap and that was the major decision turning point. And then, Charlie, he snuck in a third question, which he wants to know our outlook for fourth quarter, given the full-year guidance. Okay. Well, Charlie, it's also too early to talk about fourth quarter. But I think you can do the math and come up with certain estimation, but what we can say is our second half will be growing - will be higher than the first half. Yes. Okay, thank you. Let's move on to the next caller on the line, please? The next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Hi, thank you for taking my question. I think given your positive progress in 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer and special vision of CapEx, can we assume that similar to previous node like 7 nanometer or 12 nanometer that the first year of 3 nanometer can achieve 10% of the wafer revenue in the second year of the 5 nanometer can achieve 30% of the wafer revenue? Okay. So, Bruce your first question is regards to N5 and N3. Bruce wants to know with the progress in 3, can it be contribute 10% of the wafer revenue in the first year? And he also wants to know can N5 contribute 30% of the wafer revenue in its second year? Okay, Bruce, both of them are really too early to talk about. We certainly hope that they will be pretty big nodes, but we will definitely let you know when time is closer. Do you have a second question, Bruce? Yes, I think to just double-check that, we raised our 5G penetration shipment or forecast, but we lowered the overall smartphone shipment forecast for 2020. And how about the actual number for the 5G smartphone shipment, is that the penetration is up because of the lower total smartphone shipment or the 5G smartphone shipment, is service going up as well? Okay. So your question - second question, Bruce is that we - the global smartphones shipment we now lowered to low teens decline, but we raised the 5G penetration to high teens. Is this simply because of a lower, smaller global base or what is the 5G penetration number? Well, the 5G penetration, as I said, momentum continued to increase. So even with the total smartphone number being decreased at the low-teens, but 5G's percentage continued to increase and that's what we observed and also the 5G's semiconductors content is higher than the 4G and high - especially high-end is much higher, so that's what we based on. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next question on the line, please? The next on the line is Aaron Jeng from Nomura Securities. Go ahead please. Hey, thank you for taking my question. Can I ask a followup to Bruce's question, just right now. He was asking, by lowering the total smartphone demand to low teens, 10% to 15% now from earlier version of 5% to 10%, but raising 5G penetration rate to 15% to 20% from earlier on in mid-teens, say 15% and - but in terms of the absolute 5G phone demand or selling number, is the number being raised or it's pretty much the same as the prior version? That's a followup. Actually this is a part of my first question, but just happened to be a followup to Bruce question. Okay. Aaron, let me summarize your first question. Basically Aaron wants to know, is the - is our forecast for 5G smartphone in terms of units increased? The answer is yes. Okay? Okay, thank you. What is your second question? Okay, good. Let me - so, okay, let me ask my - this question that - I was trying to compare the outlook offered by TSMC for the industry and the outlook given six months ago. In the year beginning of the year, year beginning TSMC was saying that semi excluding memory was going to grow by 8% and now it's going to be flattish to slightly grow, which means I think overall demand including everything is lower than it was six months ago.
But total growth in the year beginning was 17%, but now it's pretty much unchanged, mid-to-high-teens growth. TSMC's growth in the year beginning was above the industry growth, now it's above 20% growth. Okay. So my question is over the next six months TSMC along with actually everyone in the world, particularly in tech have - has experienced two difficult challenges, including, one, COVID-19 and two Huawei issue, but it turns out that TSMC is doing even better than there was no two - these issues.
So I wonder - actually I think the CEO already said that the 5G absolute unit demand is going to be higher than you saw six months ago, which is one I think key reason, but it looks to me that, that factors - two negative factors are still huge. Actually one - either one of them is big, right? So - but even turn out be better than if there is no, these two negative impacts. So how should we think about this? Earlier also Chairman said that… Okay. I think, let me summarize your question because it is quite long. I think to - in essence what you're asking is, when you look at the industry framework that TSMC provided in the beginning of the year and you look at the framework now, you point out that the semi ex memory growth in January, we said plus 8, now we said flat to slightly up. Foundry growth in January, we said 17% increase year-on-year, now we say mid-to-high-teens. But for TSMC growth, we're now saying greater than 20%. So, given the challenges in this year from COVID-19 and such, what is driving TSMC's stronger growth? Well, I can answer that question by simply one word, technology leadership. Actually we see a very strong demand from our 7 nanometer and 5 nanometers technology. And 5G again, I would like to say that 5G's momentum is getting strong. Okay. And including also HPC, I'm sorry. Yes. All right, thank you. Operator, can we move on to the next question please, from the line? Next we're having Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Thanks for taking my followup question. First of all, I just wanted to understand, we are running at 20-plus percent growth this year. Any thoughts on - I mean we expect some of these megatrends to last. Any thoughts on why we aren't changing our long-term 5% to 10% target, especially given you're also spending more CapEx for - I know IP [ph] is similar and probably we need to be at a slightly higher growth rate. That's my first question.
Second, just wanted to understand what is management's view on how much of this year's outgrowth compared to the semiconductor industry has been some of this inventory build [indiscernible] and over the last several years, is very good years that you've simply outgrown the semiconductor industry or the foundry industry by a significant margin.
And this seems to be one of those years where even smartphone is not really growing, but you are declining, while TSMC is growing more than 20%. So just wanted to understand, there is quite a bit of gap between the real demand and market share gain in leading edge, but any thoughts on how much of that do you feel that some of this inventory and supply chain security inventory that your customers are building? Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your two questions. Maybe I'll start with the second question first. You just want to know management's view, the fact that TSMC's growth in 2020 is outpacing the foundry industry, can we break down what is driving this? How much of it is from supply chain - efforts to ensure supply chain security, how much of it is market share gains, how much of it is due to leading edge? We certainly - at this time, I don't think we can separate them so clearly each one, that is because of our technology, because of the share gain, because of HPC or something like that. Again, I would like to emphasize the need and the leading edge technology node on 7 and 5 and that's what we are getting our advantage. Okay. And then, your second question, Gokul to repeat again, is that with the strong growth we see this year and the megatrends that we identified for the next several years, is there - will there be a change in our long-term growth target? Well, we continue to emphasize that we will be at the high end of 5% to 10% CAGR. Remember, this kind of forecast is a rolling forecast. So we continue to have confidence in our technology and also our market share and so our growth. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next caller from the line? Next one, we are having Sebastian Hou from CLSA. Go ahead please. Sebastian, are you on the line? Sorry, I forgot to unmute. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can hear you. Please go ahead. Okay. Okay, thank you. So I have two follow ups. First one is that the 5 nanometer revenue contribution is lower from 10% to 8%, but total revenue outlook is raised. So if we do the math and 5 nanometer revenue probably lower by 15% compared to April, if we further compare to January guidance then actually 20% lower. So how do we attribute this? Is it to the customers that got sanctioned in May, or any other reasons?
And furthermore it also means that the other technology nodes are actually growing stronger. So I wonder what's your - what was driving the other applications, node and also can you give us an update on your expectation for growth for the four major platforms with the new revised up guidance? Thank you. Okay. So, let me summarize Sebastian's question. He wants to know what is driving the difference in terms of N5 today versus six months ago and what other nodes then are stronger? And then he also wants to know the 2020 outlook - growth outlook by platform. Okay, Sebastian. Actually compared to six months ago our N5 revenue actually increases and so do the other nodes. Maybe you can double check the math. And then the 2020 growth outlook by the four platforms. On okay. All the platforms will grow, except the automotive. Okay. Okay. My second question is also follow-on the 5G smartphone, also the total smartphone guidance you just - just gave and the other hand it impacts about, so what are the - it looks like the total 5G smartphone numbers - absolute number is raised. And I want to - was it based on the forecast on the final sell-out numbers or based on the forecast that you're seeing from your smartphone SOC fabs? Thank you. Well we based on the one what we saw customer. So that's our numbers, that our customer demand to TSMC. Of course, they are also doing their forecast as we did. Okay, thank you, Sebastian. Yes, Sebastian, sorry. Okay, let's move on to the next caller. Next one, we're having Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Go ahead please. Yes, sir. Thank you so much for taking my followup. I'm a little bit confused and I was wondering if you could help me, all the 5G smartphone data points suggest that the smartphones that are selling through are priced well less than US$300 and also your commentary suggests that despite the fact that COVID has had a second wave your outlook is actually stronger. So how can we reconcile this 5G smartphone, which is mostly driven by low-end and the second wave of COVID with your outlook? Okay. Mehdi, your question is, how - your observation is that 5G smartphone sell-through is mainly coming through at the low end 5G smartphones, priced at US$300 or less and with the potential second wave of COVID, how can you reconcile this low-end demand with what TSMC has seen? Is that correct? And also, your update for the year, because early in the last conference call you said your outlook is based on COVID normalizing by June, but it seems like there is a second wave. So, Mehdi is also asking because in April, we said our outlook was premised on stabilization of COVID by June, but now it looks like COVID-19 continues. We don't - actually we don't confirm there is a second wave of COVID-19 per se. But we leave that one alone. We do observe that our customers have demand to TSMC. And you mentioned that the 5G is only in the low end, we do expect there is a lot of new 5G phones, pretty high-end in the second half of 2020 and that's what we based our assumption. Okay, thank you. May I ask one followup on CapEx? Okay. There is one detail of increase to 2020 CapEx, is that equally distributed between front-end equipment and backend or is it more in one particular area? What's driving the incremental increase? Okay. So Mehdi, your second question is what – was the increase in the CapEx guidance, is it more driven by the front-end or the backend for 2020? Yes, well, basically it's front-end. Okay, thank you. Operator, let's move on to the next caller. Next one, we are having Laura Chen from KGI. Go ahead please. Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations for the good results. Actually my question is also related to the advanced packaging. I recall that we mentioned that we have about 3 billion [indiscernible] for the advanced packaging last year for the revenue contribution. I'm just wondering what the latest guidance for this year. Any revenue target for advanced packaging, and also, what's our trend looking forward in this space? On the incremental increased CapEx do we also have some trend [ph] in this space? Okay. So, Laura's question is related to the advanced packaging. She wants to know last year it was not 3 billion it was 2.85 billion. So what is the growth outlook for this year? Number one. And then what's the plan for advanced packaging, the outlook going forward? Okay. We expect that the advanced packaging will grow probably similar to our corporate average this year. As to the CapEx increase yes, a little bit, but mostly at the front-end, and with the advanced technology. Okay. Do you have a second question, Laura? Yes. My second question is about the legacy process and also like 28-nanometer, we all know that advanced packaging we are very strong and fully loaded. I'm just wondering that for the legacy capacity and the utilization rate and especially for 28-nanometer as CC also mentioned before that you see structurally overcapacity in this space. Looking forward, can we expect improvement in second half of next year, given our good progress in the RFID or the CIS, et cetera? Okay. So let me summarize your second question, Laura is looking at our mature nodes, what is the utilization outlook for our mature nodes and specifically for 28-nanometer? Do we see improvement in second half of 2021? All right, let me answer that. Our mature node or we call it specialty, our mature nodes I don’t think actually is quite good except 28-nanometer. Okay? I still want to emphasize that 28 nanometer has been overcapacity for the whole industry, but we continue to improve it, and slowly, of course, we can see that CMOS [ph] and also other applications that were moving to 28-nanometer, but it is slower than we thought. However, it will be improved. We have confidence to say that. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Operator, let's move on to the next caller. Next want to ask questions, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. Your line is open now. Okay. Yes, thank you for the followup questions. First one I wanted to just go back with a clarification on the Huawei, if you're factoring in for the future view and the potential shipments, I think one is the regulation seemed to allow some ways to shift about, I know you will comply by the rules, but it seems to allow some way to ship directly to OSAT. I am curious, either from that or perspective that you get a partial or full license, if you're building that into the base case? Actually, the current, the current regulation spells do not prohibit the standard product or general product to be able to ship to Huawei. And therefore, we think Huawei's smartphone business, will most likely they may strategize to stay by procuring general purpose products. I think Randy part of your question is that from TSMC's perspective are there alternative ways to ship to this customer such as shipping to OSAT or will we have a partial license? No, no, we don't, we don't have alternative way to ship. Okay. Okay if I can get the second question, if you could? Randy, did you, are you still there? Nanometer if that's a bit of a steep ramp up [technical difficulty] sorry, maybe available in 2020. Sorry. Randy, you dropped off for a second. Can you repeat your second question again? Yes, it's actually more about these half nodes. The 4-nanometer will be available, I think mass production early 2022, so with 3 coming out late in the year, if you're expecting that would be the steep ramp, so we could see high volume, it also could allow you I think with the tool reuse a bit lower spend. So I'm curious how you're thinking about that? And then also on the 6-nanometer, if you're still seeing most of the customers from 7 migrate to 6. Well, I think previously expected majority could end up going to that half node. Thank you. Okay. Your second question, Randy is related to, and N4 and N3 and thus will we with the timing differences of N4 and N3 will we see lower spend as a result? Randy's view is that N4 will be early 2022, N3 will be late 2022 and then so with some conversion will that result in lower spend? And he also wants to know for N6, we've talked about it before. Do we see still a strong migration of our customers from N7 to the ex N6? But let me answer the second one first. On the N6, yes, we have been over to our customer with compatible of actually the fully compatible to N7, so it will have a very good opportunity to catch the second wave of 7-nanometers product.
With the same kind of strategy we offer N4 to follow that N5. So we do expect that N5 as product finally, a lot of a large portion of the N5 product will move to N4. So, it's not the two mix that we say N3 is appropriate so N3 is ramp up. N3 is another full node, it's not a - it's more advanced, that's by nature. So again N5, so N3 is a N3, N4 is a N4. And then N6, do we see a strong…? Yes, we - I already said that N6 is following the N7. Okay? Okay, operator, let's move on to the next caller. Next one we are having, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. The line is open to you, now. Thanks for taking my followup question. So two parts, firstly is that the N3 and CapEx do you spend some CapEx for N3 this year so that's another reason why you'll see a CapEx upward revision? Okay. Charlie, your first question is that for 2020 CapEx, do we spend - does it include spending for N3? Charlie, part of the CapEx this year is for N3, but that's not the reason for our increase in CapEx. Okay. And do you have a second question, Charlie. Yes, I do. So every quarter, I ask this question about the time of completion and notably, you're trying to compete [indiscernible] to make the Asia IPO with a very high valuation, and suppose the both money can spend for the future of CapEx or even revenue growth. And so - and I'm not saying that - in the recent quarter that in the long-term do you think that there is a threat, and you probably may lose market share to China players given they won the localization or you have any China strategy to accommodate to China's localization policy? Thank you. Okay. So Charlie, your question is that what is the threat from Chinese foundry competition, do we see it as a growing threat, how do we respond? Charlie, I also answer every time that we compete the technology and the manufacturing and the customer relationship and localization in China in other area we stay the same, we compete in technology, manufacturing and we have been keeping very good relationship with our customer, we won their trust. Okay, thank you. In the interest of time, I think we'll take the last two callers on the line. Next one, we are having Bruce Lu, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Thank you for taking my follow-up question. The first quarter is known for the capital intensity. I think, I remember, like six months ago, management was talking about capital intensity will go back to 30% to 35% for 2021, but earlier management was talking about, you will go back to closer to 35%. So do we foresee that the capital intensity norm will be closer to 35% or the norm will still remain at 30% to 35%? Okay, Bruce. I think our comment is over the long run it will go to above 35% and that remains the same. Okay I understand that. My second question is that, we saw that TSMC announced two new factories for the packaging this year just did the groundbreaking the sites for the factory is pretty big. Do we anticipate that the advanced packaging penetration rate will be a lot higher in the advanced node and what's the future outlook for the advanced packaging? Okay, so your second question is the - Bruce wants to know that we announced a large advanced packaging site recently. So he wants to know what is the penetration rate, so to speak, for advanced packaging in the leading nodes going forward and what is the outlook? Well, we do work with our customer closely, and we do see some increase on the demand of advanced packaging and therefore we try to enlarge our capacity, that's for sure. But then these traits that we enlarged our advanced packaging capacity is for leading edge also for specialties. There is a new demand coming out and we have to work with our customer to mitigate their requirement. Okay. Operator, thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we take the last caller on the line, please? Yes, the last one to ask questions is Sebastian Hou, CLSA. Go ahead please. Thank you. Next on the CapEx increase, the 1 billion CapEx increase, which particularly node did that go to? Thank you. Sebastian wants to know with the increase in the CapEx to 16 to 17 billion from 15 to 16 previously, what node is the CapEx spending going to be it? It's leading edge. Okay, got it. Then maybe one last question is, I think the U.S. senator has proposed to bills, the CHIPS Act and American Foundry Act in June. So I am wondering that the, how does that cover with TSMC Arizona plant and if that were to be passed that they will be passed will TSMC or a non-American company are eligible for the potential subsidy? Thank you. Well, Sebastian, just to make sure we understand your question. Your question is related to some of the proposed regulations in the U.S., such as the CHIPS Act and the AFA, if these bills were to be passed, whether it would be eligible for TSMC or the industry? Yes, it's well aligned with our request and if those bills in different form passed, I think the administration in the State of Arizona will make this project happen. Okay. Thank you, Sebastian. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within four hours from now. The transcript will be available 24 hours from now and both of them will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
Thank you for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay healthy and safe and we hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye and have a good day.","TSMC is hosting its earnings conference call via live audio webcast . the conference call will be as follows: vice president and CFO, wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2020, followed by our guidance for the third quarter 2020 . tsmc's chairman, Dr. mark Liu, will host a Q&A session .",1.0

This is Jeff Su, TSMC's Director of Investor Relations and your host for today.
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. [Operator Instructions]
The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2020, followed by our guidance for the fourth quarter 2020. Afterwards, TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei and Mr. Huang will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone.
Third quarter revenue increased 14.7% sequentially in NT dollars or 16.9% in U.S. dollars, as we saw strong demand for our advanced technologies and special technology solutions driven by 5G smartphones, HPC and IoT-related applications. Gross margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 53.4%, mainly thanks to a much higher level of utilization, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and unfavorable exchange rate.
The operating expenses increased by TWD 7.4 billion, mainly attributable to a higher level of development activities for N4 and N3 technologies and onetime expenses to facilitate our expansion in Hsinchu. Therefore, operating margin slightly declined by 0.1 percentage points sequentially to 42.1%.
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 5.3, and ROE was 31.3%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 8% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 35% and 18%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 61% of wafer revenue.
In terms of revenue contribution by platform, smartphone increased 12% quarter-over-quarter, to account for 46% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 25%, to account for 37%. IoT increased 24%, to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 23%, to account for 2%. Digital consumer electronics decreased 24%, to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 742 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 27 billion mainly due to the decrease of short-term loans and the decrease of current portion of bonds payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 146 billion mainly as we raised TWD 145 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios. Accounts receivable turnover days decreased 4 days to 40 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 58 days primarily due to N5 ramp.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 190 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 99 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for fourth quarter '19 cash dividend. Short-term loan decreased by TWD 17 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 136 billion mainly due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 137 billion to TWD 604 billion at the end of the quarter.
In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.4 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 12.4 billion and USD 12.7 billion, representing a 3.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.75, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin between 40.5% and 42.5%.
Now I will hand over to -- the call to C.C. for his key messages. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
Now let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of TWD 356.4 billion or USD 12.1 billion, which was above our guidance, mainly due to better demand across all our platforms than our forecast 3 months ago. Moving into fourth quarter 2020, we expect our sequential growth to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.
On the inventory front, we forecast our fabless customers' overall inventory to exit the year above the seasonal level as the supply chain continues to make efforts to ensure supply chain security and actively prepare for the new 5G smartphone launches. Looking ahead, we expect our customers' overall inventory to remain above the historical seasonal level for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply chain security amidst the lingering uncertainties.
For the full year of 2020, although COVID-19 continue to bring some level of impact to the global economies, we also observe that COVID-19 is accelerating digital transformation, while 5G and HPC-related applications continue to drive semiconductor content enrichment. We now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase mid-single-digit percentage, while foundry industry growth is expected to be close to 20% year-over-year. For TSMC, our technology leadership position enable us to capture the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC. We expect to outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by about 30% in 2020 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our N5 ramp-up and N4 progress.
TSMC's N5 is foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in volume production with good yield, while we continue to improve the productivity and performance of the EUV tools to further enhance our leadership in EUV technology. Due to the robust demand from 5G smartphones and HPC applications, we'll reaffirm N5 will contribute about 8% of our wafer revenue in 2020, and we expect even higher percentage in 2021.
N4. While leveraging the strong foundation of N5 to further extend our 5-nanometer family, N4 is a straightforward migration from N5 with compatible design rules while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next-wave 5-nanometer products. N4 risk production is targeted for 4Q 2021 and volume production in 2022. With our continuous technology enhancement, we expect our 5-nanometer family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction, as compared with N5. We have chosen FinFET transistor structure for our N3 technology to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. Hence, we will offer complete platform support for both mobile and HPC applications. Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3 nanometer will be a large -- another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC 3DFabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3D IC technology road map to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplets and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better, power-efficient and smaller-form-factor benefits for our customers while shortening their time to market. This technology is including chip-stacking solutions such as SoIC as well as advanced packaging solution such as InFO and CoWoS. We are consolidating this offering under one umbrella and naming it TSMC 3DFabric.
As industry continue to seek innovations to enhance system-level performance, 3DFabric will complement our advanced technology to unleash our customers' innovation. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which including both advanced packaging and testing, to grow at a rate slightly above the corporate average in the next few years.
Now let me turn the microphone over to Wendell. Thank you, C.C.
Let me start by making some comments on our profitability.
Our third quarter gross margin exceeded the high end of our guidance, to reach 53.4%, mainly as we saw a much higher-than-expected overall capacity utilization rate in the third quarter. That helped to offset the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 5-nanometer technology. We have just guided fourth quarter gross margin to decline by 0.9 percentage points sequentially to 52.5% at the midpoint primarily due to the margin dilution from the continued steep ramp-up of our 5-nanometer and a less-favorable foreign exchange rate in the fourth quarter.
Looking to 2021, we expect the strong ramp of N5 to contribute a higher percentage of revenue, as compared to 2020. The yield rate of N5 continues to improve. Similar to prior nodes, we forecast N5's gross margin to take 7 or 8 quarters to reach the corporate average level. Thus, N5 is expected to dilute our gross margin by about 2 to 3 percentage points for the full year of 2021.
As a reminder, the following 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix as well as foreign exchange rate. Taking all these factors into consideration, we believe a long-term gross margin of above 50% is achievable.
Now let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Our business outlook is supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced technologies and specialty technology solutions, driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications. In order to meet this demand and support our customers' capacity needs, we now expect our full year 2020 CapEx to be about USD 17 billion.
Now I will make some comments on our corporate bond issuances and capital structure. The multiyear megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications are expected to continue to drive strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. Given the macroeconomic uncertainties this year, a current low interest rate environment and ability to diversify our funding sources, TSMC's Board of Directors has so far approved the issuance of TWD 120 billion in NT dollar-denominated corporate bonds and $4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds. Year-to-date, we have issued TWD 89.5 billion in NT dollar-denominated and $4 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds with favorable pricing terms. With our solid financial performance, strong balance sheet and cash position and capacity to take on debt, we are able to aggressively invest in our future to enhance our technologies and capabilities. This enables us to continue to outgrow the semiconductor industry through the cycles. With our disciplined capital management, we remain committed to sustainable cash dividends on both annual and quarterly basis. Thank you, Wendell.
This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions]
Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Questions will be taken in the order in which they were received. [Operator Instructions]
So now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? The first caller on the line is Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Congratulations on great quarter. My first question is on CapEx and capital intensity. It looks like, this year, we will come in around 36%, 37% capital intensity. Could we talk a little bit about how we should think about capital intensity and absolute CapEx as well going -- looking forward, at least on a directional basis? It seems like the investment cycle is still going to be very much intact going into next year, also looking at some of the financial options in terms of bond rates and et cetera, that TSMC has undertaken. That is my first question.
My second question is on N5. I think in previous calls we have indicated that, while N5 will be a long and large node, it may not have the same number of tapeouts as N7 has had, which is probably historical high. Is our view changing on N5? Could we talk a little bit about will N5 exceed N7 in terms of wafer capacity as well as wafer revenue in the next 2 years or so? Okay, Gokul, thank you very much. We'll take your questions one by one. Please allow me to summarize your question. Your first question relates to our CapEx and capital intensity. You point out that -- with the guidance that our capital intensity this year, in your estimation, is probably around 36% to 37%. So your question is how should we think about CapEx and capital intensity in the next few years. If we cannot give a quantitative number directionally, how do we see CapEx and capital intensity? And how does this tie in with our recent things like -- such as bond issuances and fundraising? How does that factor in? That's the first question. Maybe CFO Wendell can address. Okay, yes. Gokul, our capital intensity, as you are right, this year will be lower than 40%. In the next several years, longer term, we expect the capital intensity to be around mid-30 percentage point. However, having said that, there may be years where capital intensity is higher if we see the strong demand for our technologies or capacity and we decide to invest. Okay. And then your second question, Gokul, please allow me to summarize again, is regarding to our 5-nanometer that we have said that it's a long and large node but that we -- the number of tapeouts of N5 versus N7 may be lower. So your question is can N5 exceed N7. Do we believe 5-nanometer can be a bigger node than 7 in terms of revenue and capacity? Well, let me say that we don't comment on how many tapeouts, so far, but we continue to see strong tapeout activities at N5 from both HPC and smartphone applications. And revenue for this year, we just mentioned, is 8% of the wafer revenue, and next year, it will be even higher than -- close to -- or 20%, something like that. The exact number, we are still not able to comment, but I can assure you that our 5-nanometer family will be another big and long-lasting node for TSMC. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Next one, we have Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. Okay, yes. My first question, I wanted to ask on Wendell. You raised the gross margin. Originally it was 50%. Could you discuss now where you're saying it could be above 50%, the factors driving that change? And could you clarify on the 2- to 3-point impact on 5-nanometer? I think you already have that impact, so does that imply for next year pretty similar to the type of gross margin you're running now or potentially even better? Okay, Randy, I'll summarize your question. Your first question is in regards to, I believe, our gross margin and long-term gross margin. I think you're asking that we raised our target, but I think we -- as Wendell said, 50% is achievable for us, but you're also asking as part of that the dilution from 5-nanometer. How will that impact our gross margin next year? And where should we, I guess, be thinking about gross margin for 2021? Okay. Randy, maybe I -- let me answer this like this. We have a very high gross margins in the third quarter, and we believe we will continue have a pretty high margin in the fourth quarter. And main reason is that we are enjoying a very high utilization across almost all the nodes at this moment, but the high -- very high utilization may not continue forever, so our long-term growth target or long-term growth goal for our gross margin continues to be above 50%. In terms of dilution from N5, we see the dilution of N5 for next year to be around 2 to 3 percentage point, similar to previous nodes. And remember that the N5 will account for a much bigger percentage of our revenue next year. So as we ramp up quickly, the dilution will continue to exist. However, we are still expecting that it will reach the corporate margin by -- in 7 to 8 quarters. Okay. No, great. I misunderstood. I thought I heard the word ""above"" for 50%. Second question, on the recent U.S. restriction on SMIC. I'm curious if you're seeing any additional diversification or increase for business. And given they're more on the mature nodes, how you're positioned, if you are seeing those, to take on business on the mature nodes. Okay, Randy, let me just summarize your second question. Your second question is regards to the recent restrictions on SMIC. And Randy is wondering whether we are seeing any types of diversification or inquiries from customers in regards to business and especially at the mature nodes. Well, Randy, let me answer the question. Actually we are still evaluating the impact to the semiconductor industry and the -- due to the ban on SMIC, but let me say that our capacity planning and all our CapEx continue based on the long-term demand profile. That is underpinned by the industry megatrends such as 5G-related and HPC application, all right? Does that answer your question? Yes. Or maybe just one quick. But for the mature nodes, which are running tight across the industry, just if it's so that there's an incremental surge, how well could you handle incremental business from this type of piece if it were to come through? So Randy is asking, if we were to see a surge in demand at the mature nodes, how ready -- or do we have capacity to take on or handle this type of surge demand? Well, we continue to work with our customer dynamically and we try our best to meet their demand. That's all I can say for today. Yes. The next one is Sebastian Hou from CLSA. My first question is I think, besides the higher-than-usual inventory, which may be a new norm because of this supply chain year of disruption, how -- I wonder. I'm curious about how does TSMC assess customers' overbooking or pulling behavior and the magnitude. In particular, based on the recent smartphone OEMs' aggressive procurement about -- assuming Huawei is going to be there next year, how did you assess that, kind of the potential overbuild inventory risk that may potentially lead to a destocking correction sometime next year? This is my first question. Okay, Sebastian, let me repeat or try to summarize your question. Your question is basically related to the inventory. And you want to ask how does TSMC assess the risk that there is overbooking in light of the restrictions on Huawei. And therefore, what type of levels or magnitude of inventory overbuild is there? And does this create the risk of inventory correction sometime next year? Well, let me share with you our view on these inventory-related issues. First, I want to say that, due to the pandemic, actually the digital transformation has been accelerated, and that create a demand on 5G and HPC-related products. And so for the long term -- longer-term basis, we do expect our customers' overall inventory to remain above the seasonal level for a longer period of time, majority partly because of they have some concern on industry's supply chain security and due to the uncertainties. And so that what -- the inventory, high-level inventory, will sustain, continue for a longer period of time. That, we can say that. Okay, Sebastian, do you have a second... Yes, all right. Sorry. Yes, okay, all right. Anyway, but that isn't actually what I'm looking for, but anyway. And my second question is on the HPC business. Apparently, I think the -- C.C., you mentioned in the prepared remark that we'll see a lot of the growth this quarter and also continued strength next quarter and driven by the accelerating digital transformation. You just said it at -- led by the pandemic and work-from-home demand like to stay for longer. And also to continue to -- share gain from TSMC against IDM. And when do you expect your HPC revenue exposure to cross over with smartphone revenue percentage? Possible to see that by end of next year or 2022? Okay, Sebastian, let me just summarize your question, which is regards to our HPC platform business. You point out that there is the trends of the accelerating digital transformation and the work from home and also market share gains versus IDM. So you want to know when do we see our HPC platform revenue crossing over with the smartphone or others, to become the primary. Okay, let me answer the question. We do see HPC platforms growth rate is higher in among our 4 platform, which is smartphone, HPC, automotive and IoT. And in the next few years, we continue to expect what we forecast, that HPCs growth will be higher than the corporate level. When it will cross over, I don't make any comment right now. Yes, okay. Next one, we have Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. So I want to ask about the 5G penetration rate. So what is the latest forecast for the total smartphone growth and 5G penetration rate in 2020? And maybe a little bit of color on 2021 as well. So we also see that some of the telco is slowing down their 5G base installation. What kind of impact we see at this moment? Okay, Bruce, your question is regards to 5G and smartphones. You want to know what is the smartphone growth and 5G penetration rate for 2020 as well as 2021 and then in light of the telecoms potentially slowing down the deployment, correct? Yes, yes. Okay. All right, let me answer the question. We continue to expect the faster penetration of 5G smartphone, as compared to 4G. And for this year, we still forecast a high-teens penetration rate, and next year, even higher, much higher. Let me say that. And that's all we have today. And any impact from the telcos business as well? I think all countries and all regions are preparing to build up the infrastructure right now. And I believe, next year, even not 100% completed, but all the region or the countries will have a lot of 5G phone being introduced, and that create a higher-percentage penetration rate. Okay, I understand. My next question is that I'm a little bit surprised that China revenue contribution only increased slightly from 22% to 23% in third quarter. So which region will we see the strongest growth in fourth quarter? Okay, Bruce, your question is regards to our revenue by geography, and you want to know, for the fourth quarter, which region will contribute the most growth, in the fourth quarter. Okay, Bruce, we're not prepared to comment on geographic allocation among revenues in the fourth quarter. I can share with you that we expect the platforms that will grow in the fourth quarter will be smartphone and automotive, and the other 2 will likely to be down. We have Sunny Lin from UBS. So my first question is on 5-nanometer demand. So in the next 2 to 3 years, what do you think revenues for it could be by smartphone, HPC, et cetera? And do you think the mix could be a bit different from 7-nanometer? Sorry. Can you repeat your question, Sunny? You broke up a little bit. Sure, sure, no problem. Sorry about that. So I wonder, for 5-nanometer demand in the next 2 to 3 years, what does the management think of the revenue mix? Could be by smartphone, HPC, et cetera. And will the product mix be a bit different from 7-nanometer? Okay, all right. Let me summarize. Thank you, Sunny. Your question is regards to 5-nanometer. And then when we look out over the next 3 years, how do we see the demand of 5-nanometer, the mix, changing in terms of smartphone, HPC, different platforms? And then how does this compare to 7-nanometer? Correct? That's right. We don't break it down or disclose the platform mix of certain nodes, but we can share with you, as C.C. just mentioned, in the next several years, we expect HPC to be the largest contributor of our growth. So that should give you some idea. And these guys use advanced technologies. Sure. Got it. And my second question is that, for this year, a key part of your growth in smartphones is driven by higher silicon content for 5G and your share gains, so I wonder if you could walk us through how your average silicon content in smartphone may trend into 2021 and 2022. Okay. So Sunny, your second question is regards to the silicon content in 5G phones. Of -- the silicon content increase in 5G phone, along with share gain, is contributing to our smartphone growth this year, so she wants to know what is the silicon content outlook for 2021 and '22. This is pretty hard for me to answer because I did -- I cannot release all the information I got from my customer, but let me say that on the average the 5G phone have about 30% to 40% more silicon content, as compared with 4G. Did that give you some kind of idea? Sure. So I have a very quick follow-up. Wonder if you could give us some color regarding your expectation of your market share for smartphone in the next 2, 3 years. So Sunny is asking whether we can give some comment on the market share, our market share, in 5G phones the next 2 to 3 years. No. It's not very appropriate for me to give some kind of estimate right now, but let me say that, as long as we have a technology leadership position, we are very confident that we are going to have a high market share. Okay? Sure, got it. Next, we have Roland Shu from Citigroup. My first question is can you update on the status of your license applications for shipments to Huawei. When do we expect to receive approval from U.S. government? And also, does your 4Q revenue forecast include any wafer shipment to Huawei? This is my first question. Okay, Roland. So your question is regards to -- he wants an update of our license application status regarding Huawei. And he also wants to know, does our fourth quarter guidance include any shipments to Huawei? Roland, we are complying fully with regulations. And so -- and we also notice that there is a report saying that TSMC got the license. We are not going to comment on this unfounded speculation and we also don't want to comment on our status right now. For the 4Q shipment to Huawei, no. The ban, the regulation already say that up to September 17... 15... September 15, okay, same. Okay, okay. Okay, my second question is, how is the pricing pressure across all technology nodes, so far? Some of your foundry peers are considering to raise with ASP given a very high utilization at 8-inch fab. So were you considering to follow to raise the pricing of 8-inch or other mature technology nodes? Okay, Roland, let -- thank you. So your second question is regards to pricing pressure. Your note is that some of the foundry peers are considering to raise the 8-inch wafer price. So you want to know, does TSMC plan to raise our 8-inch wafer pricing or also raise our pricing on the mature nodes? Let me answer the question. The answer, the big answer, is no. We continue to work with customers, and customer are our partners. So for short-term supply shortage, we are -- definitely we are not using this kind of opportunity to raise our price. Our wafer price -- we are selling our values, our service to our customer, that including the technology, delivery, quality, everything. Certainly, TSMC is working with all the customer and view them as partners, and so we don't using this opportunity to raise our wafer price. Did that answer your question? Yes. Next, we're having Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I just had a question on your long-term capacity planning. I mean you've laid out the view that we're going to see some structural tightness for the next couple years in foundries potentially. And I'm just wondering if you see -- you have a very strong growth position in HPC, but you still have a very low market share in like x86 or PC and servers broadly. I'm just wondering. If we do see Intel looking to outsource major CPU lines to foundry, it could be a large onetime boost to the industry, to the foundry industry, so would TSMC be in a meaningful -- would you be able to meaningfully support Intel's needs if there was a big onetime outsourcing? And would you be prepared to take capital intensity to much higher levels should the opportunity arise? Okay, Brett, let me try to summarize your question. Your question basically is premised around our long-term capacity planning and pointing out that there's a structural tightness in foundry. And we TSMC has a strong growth position. So your question specifically relates to x86 and Intel. If Intel were to outsource in a -- to foundry, your premise is that this could be a onetime, big outsourcing opportunity. And so how would we prepare or handle for this? Well, let me say that we do not comment on the specific customers, nor on the specific product, but let me say our CapEx and capacity planning is based on the long-term demand profile, that underpinned by the industry, the megatrend to meet our customers' demand. And Intel is one of our important customers and we continue to work with them. Do... Okay. And maybe just a follow-up regarding your capacity plans over the near term. Are you planning to add any capacity at the mature nodes, maybe not so much 8-inch but certainly sort of 28-nanometer or even 16-nanometer? And do you foresee putting any customers on allocation given the backdrop with tightness at the moment? Okay. So Brett, your second question is regards to our capacity plans in the near term, specifically at some of the mature nodes like 28- and 16-nanometer. Are we planning to add capacity? And with the tightness, are customers on allocation? Well, again, let me say that we plan our capacity to meet the customers' demand. Whether it's leading-edge, whether mature node or specialties, we always work with customer dynamically and also work with them closely so to plan out capacity. And definitely today there is some shortage, but we are doing our best to serve our customers. Okay, thank you, Brett. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. My first question is about your 2-nanometer progression because I think, a couple of weeks ago, there was a news talking about you may see the 2-nanometer in mass production in 2024. So I just wanted to get company's clarification about your progress here, maybe your technology road map and that realistic timing for the mass production. Okay. So Charlie's first question is in regards to our 2-nanometer. He says, according to news reports, that the production is going to begin in 2024, so he wants to know whether we can share the technology road map requirements and the timing of our 2-nanometer. Charlie, let me say, frankly, we are not ready to make any comment on the 2-nanometer yet, all right? Okay, yes, but there seems to be some comments from your technology forum, so any reason why you can't disclose that to investors, the timing for the year? No. I think, Charlie, all we have disclosed about our 2-nanometer is the location, which will be in Hsinchu. We have not commented on the technology specifications, the timing or anything beyond that. So that is you -- as you said, according to your reading the news. That is not TSMC's comment. And C.C. said we are not prepared to comment on 2-nanometer. Okay, okay, okay, no problem at all. And my second question is maybe to Wendell, about the gross margin trend follow-up. So based on your current depreciation table, when do you think that depreciation is going to peak in the coming years or coming quarters, at what point? And also I think you mentioned that the new node brand is a key factor to the gross margin dilution, but I think 4-nanometer is part of the 5-nanometer family, right, so can we expect that in 2022 there's no -- not going to be any kind of margin dilution from the 4-nanometer? All right. So Charlie, your second question is regards to depreciation and gross margin. Charlie wants to know when do we expect depreciation to peak out on a quarterly or an annual basis. And he also wants to know that would we expect dilution from 4-nanometer in 2022 given that 4-nanometer is an extension of our 5-nanometer. Should there therefore not be dilution from 4-nanometer? Okay, Charlie. The first questions, really difficult to answer because, if you continue to invest, you may not have a peak in depreciation just as, if you continue to have strong growth, you may not have a peak in your revenue. So the second question, yes, we still expect that, N5 family, the gross margin to reach corporate average in about 7 or 8 quarters and which is sometime in 2022. Great, all right. Right now we're having Laura Chen from KGI. Congratulations for the good result. My first question is regarding 3-nanometer. Can you give us update on current engagement? And we know that C.C. just mentioned we will have risk production next year and mass production probably on second half 2020. I'm just wondering. Will the smartphone or HPC go first? Okay, that's my first question. Okay, so Laura, your first question is regards to our 3-nanometer. She wants to know what is the current engagement with customers. And then with the volume production targeted for second half 2022, is it going to be smartphone- or HPC-driven? All right, let me answer the question first on the engaging with customer. We are engaging with more customer at N3, as compared with N5 and N7, at the similar stage, okay? So there is a lot of customers working with us. And now which one -- in the second half of 2022, which one will be the first product actually in smartphone and HPC applications? Both. Okay. And then my second question is about our supply chain equipment procurement plans. I think given our positive outlook and continuous CapEx, so do we plan to evaluate more local suppliers? So I think -- given TSMC's leading position in the global foundry space, I think that's -- give a good position to lead the localization equipment. So can you give us some color about what's your view on the -- to buy more equipment from the Taiwanese supplier or current status of total procurement percentage per year from Taiwanese vendors, something like that? Okay, Laura. So your second question is regards to our vendor and supply chain procurement strategy. Your question is really will -- are we considering -- will we consider to use more local Taiwan suppliers? Do we have any type of percentage breakdown or anything like that? Correct? Yes, yes, correct. Okay. We develop the technology while we maintain the technology and the manufacturing based on the best performance and the best cost structure. So we did not put the where it came from. Or we did not put the regions into consideration, to be frank with you. So the best technology, the best manufacturing cost is what we count. And so we don't have any certain percentage limitation on which area or -- the equipment came from, all right? Okay, does that answer your question, Laura? Okay, thank you. Next one, we'd have Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company. Yes. I have 2 of them. First one is on the mature nodes, i.e., 28-nanometer and above. Not currently but over the next few years, how do you expect the revenues and wafer starts to trend on the mature nodes, especially as some of your customers start migrating to the leading edge? And then my second question is, in the past, you've spoken about converting some 28-nanometer-plus capacity to 20-nanometer or so for IoT and other applications. Can you provide us an update on how this transition is going? Okay, thank you, Krish. Let me try to summarize your questions. Maybe I'll summarize the first one, and then we can summarize the second. Your first question is regards to our mature nodes, specifically 20-nanometer and above. You want to know, in the next few years, what is the revenue outlook and also the demand or wafer starts outlook, over the next few years, especially as customers may start to migrate to more leading nodes. What do we do at 28-nanometer and above? What is the outlook? Well, let me answer the -- specifically on the 28-nanometer. We continue to improve the technology. And now we offer 22-nanometer side, ultra-low power, and that's for IoT applications. And we also work with the customer to migrate their product from 65, 55, to 45, to 28 and to 22. Today, the noding is not perfect yet, but we expect in 1 or 2 years, and then we expect the noding work greatly improved. And so to answer your question on all the mature node, we're still improving our technologies and we still expect the growth. Okay. And I think, Krish, just to clarify, your -- the second question was in regards to 28. And your question was conversion to 20, but as C.C. said, we are converting 28 to 22, so hopefully, that also addressed your second question, all right? Yes, it does. Next one, we're having Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities. Yes. Okay, my first question, I just want to make a little clarification about your CapEx for this year. I think Wendell said about it's going to be around USD 17 billion or it's going to be over USD 17 billion. Can I make -- can you clarify on this? And also give us some, a little bit color about the CapEx for next year, please. So your first question, to clarify, our 2020 CapEx. What -- is it about or above USD 17 billion? Yes, it's about USD 17 billion. Yes, okay, yes... Yes. For 2021 -- I'm sorry. Yes, yes. Please go ahead. Yes. Your second questions is about 2021 CapEx. It's too early to discuss the 2021 CapEx at this moment, but as -- if we see strong demand and the -- we will make the investments because the CapEx investment in this year is always for the demand in the following years. So if we see the following years have strong demand, we will invest. All right. I assume it's not second question. It's just a follow-up, right? Can I ask one more? You -- sure. Your second question, please. Okay. So second question is about the inventory. I think C.C. did mention that, right now because of the macro uncertainties, COVID-19, et cetera -- so customers intend to keep their inventories above seasonal for a longer period of time, but what if -- because -- unless uncertainty remains structural and it goes on forever. Otherwise, one day, when uncertainty are removed, do you worry about your customer to unwind inventory and cause some business correction? Okay, Rick. So your second question is regards to inventory. Although there is macro uncertainty and COVID-19 -- but someday, this will be over. So does this worry us? Will we see a sudden sharp correction or inventory drop as a result? Okay, let me share with you again our view on inventory. In fact, we don't worry too much about it because of the -- as I said, now because of pandemic, the digital transformation has been accelerated, and that create a lot of new demand. Let me say that. It looks like -- take for example now work from home. So now everybody buy a PC. Every kid had to buy a PC. And then just look at again on the 5G smartphones benefit. There are advantages of the -- on the bandwidth and the speed and the low latency, everything, and people are going to need it in this digital transformation. And so even right now it's we expect the inventory is higher than historical high level, but the demand will pick up. And in next year was -- or the 2022, we are confident that demand will pick up. And so that minimize or mitigate the impact of the inventory correction that everybody has a doubt on their mind. Okay? Great. Next one is Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Yes. First one, if your customers are willing to have inventories above this average trend line, should we assume that your wafer shipment in the first half of 2021 and specifically Q1 would also follow a better-than-seasonal trend? And I have a follow-up. Okay. So Mehdi's first question is regarding to basically our first quarter. If customers are willing to hold a higher level of inventory, should we assume that wafer shipments in the first quarter will also be much better? We are going to share with you in the first investor conference, all right? Right now we are not ready to make any comment on 2021, especially the first quarter. Okay, your second question, Mehdi? Okay, sure. Can you please remind us what we should think about tapeout activity and specifically at N4 and N5? And how does it compare to N7? Any follow-up will be great. So your question is the tapeout activity at N4 and N5 as compared to N7. Well... Yes, if there is any update? Okay. The demand is very strong in N4, N5, and we are engaging many customers. So the exact number of the tapeouts right now is all in the -- our planning and -- but I can share with you that customers' demand is very strong and will be -- continue to be strong for the next couple of years. Okay, all right. Thank you, Mehdi. Right now we have Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. There has been a lot of discussion on market share on leading edge. And so could you comment a little bit on how do we think about TSMC's market share in N7, which I think is probably like 85 -- 80%, 85% or even higher and compare that with what are we expecting for the N5 family, which will include N5 and N4? And I have a second question as well. All right, Gokul's first follow-up question is in terms of market share. He wants to ask C.C. What do we see in terms of our market share at 7-nanometer? And what is our expectation or outlook at the 5-nanometer family? Gokul, it seems I'll continue to say we have technology leadership. So I can share with you that we have very high percentage of market share, but what exact number is not appropriate, to announce it, because it's all our own estimate. But again the most important thing is not market share. The most important thing for us is continue to maintain the technology leadership, and we are focused on that. Okay? Okay. And just a follow-up question on that. Can we say at least directionally if N5 market share in our own estimate is higher than N7, or similar to N7? Okay. So the second question Gokul wants to ask, still our market share. Do we see, directionally will N5 market share be higher than that of N7? They are very similar because of we are always the technology leader. When we introduced N7, we are the technology leader. And when we introduce the N5 this year in mass production, we'll continue to be the technology leader, so they are very similar. Okay, thank you, yes. Thanks, Gokul... Okay, understood. Can I ask one more question... I think -- Gokul, sorry. That's 2, so I would -- sorry. I would like to ask you to get back in the queue because we still have, I think, quite a few people, but thank you. Okay, all right. All right. Next one, we have Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse. Okay, yes. I wanted to ask on the R&D. It stepped up faster in the quarter. From this higher level, could you discuss the investment rate that you're expecting for R&D, say, as a percent of sales? And would the new advanced nodes and packaging investments start to increase the R&D intensity? Okay. So Randy's first question is that he noticed, well, points out actually, that our R&D has increased or stepped up in the third quarter this year. So he wants to know, given advanced packaging and the continued technology leadership, what is the R&D percentage of sales outlook that they -- we should expect? Randy, let me share with you that in the third quarter the R&D expenses are higher because of our development activities in N4 and N3. Longer term, we're still expecting the R&D expense to be about 8% or slightly higher than 8% of our revenue. Okay, great. I appreciate that. And the second follow-up question I had, just on a couple segments. Auto, I think you mentioned earlier about coming back. It was soft in the quarter. Could you discuss now, as a growth driver from a low base, if you're finally seeing some of those content driver toward next 1 to 2 years? There could be a meaningful pickup even without auto but from a content. And then the other side, on consumer, which was quite weak just despite a lot of work from home and consumer electronics coming through. So if you can give color maybe on something happening in the consumer segment. Okay. So Randy's second question is really a little bit split into 2, but he wants to know, with the automotive business seeming to bottom out, how do we view our automotive platform as a growth driver? Or outlook over the next few years. And then similarly, he also is asking about digital consumer. All right. Actually, let me comment on the automotive platform. Actually the COVID-19 has a major impact on the automotive market. And supply chain this year have all been affected, but we are seeing the sign of recovery in 4Q. In the longer term, the trend towards safer, greener and smarter vehicle will continue to drive silicon content increase as well as the demand for advanced and specialty technology. And again I want to emphasize, with our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the opportunities. On the growth rate, the growth rate continue to pick up and -- but still behind the HPCs growth rate. And for the digital consumer, it's kind of flat or is a little bit growth that I can see today. Did that answer your question, Randy? Yes, yes. Just maybe the near term. I was surprised it was as much down, factoring in stay-at-home consumer electronics demand, but I don't know if anything -- just specific or short term in nature on that. Okay. Actually, some of the product -- because of stay at home or the work from home, some of the product, we put into the HPCs category. Yes, that's right. Yes, okay. Next one is Sebastian Hou, CLSA. Sebastian, you may need to unmute. So let me -- first question. Let me try the overbooking inventory question in another way again, if I may. So we understand the higher inventory is structural, led by COVID-19, but how about the higher inventory? Is that led by customers' fear of foundry capacity tightness, which is now undersupplied almost everywhere, from leading edge to cutting edge? Based on the past cycle's experience, the tighter the supply of any components, the higher the risk of supply chain overbooking. It happens. I'm curious whether TSMC is seeing any gap between customers' ordering volume and your internal forecasts on end demand. Or it's not a concern at all, as all the strong orders are just a reflection of the real demand. Okay. So Sebastian's question is around the inventory. And while, his view, some of the inventory may be related to COVID-19 and more structural or linger for a while, he wants to know. Is there a concern? Does TSMC have a concern that -- because the foundry is tight, that therefore the customers are doing a lot of overbooking or so-called double booking? And also, therefore, does this create a concern for TSMC, when we look at our internal forecast for the end-demand market versus customers booking, that there is a large gap and risk of shortfall? Well, Sebastian, actually, in TSMC's view, all my customers are our partners. So we work with them very closely. And so to -- yes, to -- basically that minimize the fear of overbooking because of they don't have to be afraid of the capacity shortage and then do the overbooking to TSMC, no. We work with them as a partner. And we -- both parties and all my customer work with TSMC and tell us their view on the market, and we share our view on the market with them also. So this one minimize all -- a lot of the possibility of overbooking. And that's way that TSMC working with our customers. They are all our partners. Did that answer your question, Sebastian? Great. Yes, yes. That's a very, very good answer. My second follow-up question is that we've seen the rising cross-trade relationship risk in recent months. So I wonder if TSMC -- or your customers are concerned or discuss with you about the potential risk in production operation, as most of your fabs are located in Taiwan, and if such heightened risk continue for longer than just months, whether TSMC will keep -- consider to keep most of that fab work in Taiwan or increase investment in the other regions. Okay, Sebastian, thank you. Let me summarize your second question. Your question is regarding that you observed rising or growing risks in the cross-trade relationships. And so for -- therefore, for our customers, do they feel there is a heightened risk? And thus, is there a need for TSMC to, I guess, paraphase, expand our manufacturing footprint into other locations, given the state of cross-trade relations, in the next few years? Okay, Sebastian. In fact, TSMC will continue to focus on Taiwan. I mean that's -- our center of R&D and majority of our production fabs will continue to be located in Taiwan regardless of that -- all the geopolitical tension or any kind of disruption. Did that answer your questions? Yes, yes. That's great. Next one, we have Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Okay. So the question is for the advanced packaging. What is the revenue growth for the advanced packaging in 2020? The growth rate seems to be very strong, but the management also only guided for like the future growth of -- for the advanced packaging is only slightly higher than the corporate average. This is much lower than what we have in the past 3 years. Any reasons behind that? And what's the profitability for the advanced packaging right now? Okay. So Bruce, your first question is regards to our advanced packaging business. You want to know what is the growth of the advanced packaging business in 2020. And also, what is the profitability of the advanced packaging? Yes. Bruce, the growth of our advanced packaging in this year is close to the corporate but not as high. In this next several years, we do expect that on a CAGR basis it will be faster -- it will grow faster than the corporate average. And in terms of margins, its margins is lower than the corporate. However, its investment intensity, capital intensity is lower. Therefore, on a return basis, ROIC basis, it is acceptable to us. Okay? Okay. So I -- the next question is for the 28 nanometers. I want to clarify something. In the fourth quarter 2019, I think that management showed a very high confidence that 28-nanometer utilization rate were back to the corporate average driven by more utilization such as CMOS and many FinFET, et cetera. However, if my understanding is correct, management still expects it will be lower than corporate average in the coming years in terms of utilization rate. Is that the right understanding right now? Okay. So your second question, Bruce, is regarding our 20-nanometer. In... 28. I'm sorry... 28. 28. I'm sorry. 28 nanometers. Yes, 28-nanometer. And that you said that we had commented in the fourth quarter '19 earnings result January this year that our 28-nanometer utilization would improve in 1 to 2 years time. And so -- and to the corporate average. And now your question is does that statement still hold true. Bruce, let me say that the progress is a little bit slower than we expected, but still, in 1 to 2 years, the utilization rate of the 28-nanometer particularly, we'll advance it to 22-nanometer while it reaching the corporate average. Okay. All right, in the interest of time, we will take the question from the last caller or last participant, please. The last one to ask questions is Roland Shu from Citigroup. Yes. On your N6 technology. It's with one more EUV layer insertion than 7+, but N4 is with reduced mask layers from N5. And it's with a simplified process. So can you elaborate your technology development logic between N6 and N4 and also the target market for N6 and N4? And how will N6 and N4 contribute to your business, respectively, going forward? Okay, Roland. So your question is regards to N6 versus N4 positioning. You point out, technology-wise, N6 has one more EUV layer than 7+, but N4 may have reduced mass players versus N5 and with simplified process. So you really -- you're asking, does N4 serve the same group or target the same group of customers as N6? Or are they separate, well, markets or targeting separate customers and applications? Correct, great. Roland, it's actually very hard to answer your question whether the N6 is the same kind of group of N4. Let me give you some kind of idea. N6 is kind of development, continued enhancement of the N7 or N7+. And so all the second wave of the customer will use N6 when they want to enter the 7-nanometer family and because of that offer the better density, better performance and better power consumption. Now the -- similar to N6, N4 is also -- will continue to improve the N5. And we also observe that, if we can reduce mask count, we can improve the defect density. We can improve the cycle time. And we also -- at the same time, we also offer the better density, better performance, et cetera, et cetera. And so are they the same group? I cannot answer this question, but it's the same purpose. We offer N6 to be the second wave of the N7's customer. We'll offer the N4 also to offer to the second wave of the customer of N5. Yes. Did that... Okay, that is -- yes, I've been -- yes. It's a little bit complicated, yes, because N4 -- does -- is there any performance enhancement to N5? Because it is with simplified process. And still there is -- I can understand at least the improvements on defect, on this product -- production cycle times, but how about from the performance point of view? Is there going to be an enhancement to N5? Okay. So your second question, Roland, continues to ask about the 4-nanometer. Will -- N4, does it carry any performance enhancement or PPA improvement as compared to N5? Yes. The short answer is yes. We improve the density. We improve the performance, including the transistor performance. Okay? Okay. All right, this concludes our Q&A session.
Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 4 hours from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now. Both of them are going to be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.

Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2020. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2021.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 1.4% sequentially in NT terms or 4.4% in U.S. dollar terms as we saw strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications. Gross margin increased 0.6 percentage point sequentially to 54%, mainly thanks to cost improvement, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and an unfavorable exchange rate. Our utilization rate in the fourth quarter was at an extremely high level partially due to more production output, of which some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter. Total operating expenses slightly decreased by TWD 2.6 billion. Therefore, operating margins increased by 1.4 percentage points sequentially to 43.5%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 5.51, and ROE was 31.4%.
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 29% and 13%, respectively. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 62% of wafer revenue.
On a full year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 8% of 2020 wafer revenue, 7-nanometer was 33%, and 16-nanometer was 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2019.
Now moving on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 13% quarter-over-quarter to account for 51% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC decreased 14% to account for 31%. IoT decreased 13% to account for 7%. Automotive increased 27% to account for 3%. Digital consumer electronics increased 29% to account for 4%.
On a full year basis, smartphone, HPC and IoT saw strong growth of 23%, 39% and 28%, respectively. DCE also increased 2%, while auto decreased 7% in 2020. Overall, smartphone accounted for 48% of our 2020 revenue, HPC accounted for 33%, and IoT accounted for 8%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 791 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 29 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 57 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD 38 billion in accrued liabilities and others, offset by the decrease of TWD 69 billion in short-term loan. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 28 billion mainly as we raised TWD 30.5 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 39 days. Days of inventory increased 15 days to 73 days primarily due to the ramp of leading nodes.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 259 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 89 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for first quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased by TWD 67 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 30.5 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 56 billion to TWD 660 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.2 billion.
Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2020. We saw a strong growth in 2020 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 31.4% in U.S. dollar terms and 25.2% in NT dollar terms to reach TWD 1.34 trillion. Gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 53.1% primarily due to a high level of capacity utilization and cost improvement. Operating margin increased 7.5 percentage point to 42.3%. Overall, full year EPS increased 50% to TWD 19.97.
On cash flow, we spent TWD 507 billion in CapEx, while we generated TWD 823 billion in operating cash flow and TWD 315 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 259 billion in cash dividends in 2020.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 12.7 billion and USD 13 billion, which represents a 1.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.95, gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 52.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. The sequential decline in first quarter gross margin is mainly due to a slightly lower utilization rate in the first quarter, albeit it is still staying at the high level, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Now I would like to talk about the tax rate. We expect our 2020 tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 11%, and this will be equally applied to all 4 quarters of the year.
This concludes my financial presentation.
Now I would like to start with the key messages for the quarter. I will start by making some comments on our capital budget in 2020 and 2021. Every year, our CapEx is invested in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership; flexible and responsive manufacturing; retaining customers' trust; and earning the proper return.
In 2020, we spent USD 17.2 billion to capture the strong demand for our advanced technologies and support our customers' capacity needs. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies and further support our customers' capacity needs, our 2021 capital budget is expected to be between USD 25 billion and USD 28 billion. Out of the $25 billion to $28 billion CapEx for 2021, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer; about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making; and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Next, let me talk about our capital intensity outlook. As we have said previously, our long-term capital intensity is in the mid-30s percentage range. However, when we enter a period of higher growth, our CapEx needs to be spent ahead of the revenue growth that will follow, so our capital intensity will be higher. For example, during 2010 to 2014, our CapEx spending increased threefold as compared to the previous few years, and our capital intensity ranged between 38% to 50%. Because of the increased investment, we were able to capture the growth opportunities and deliver about 15% growth CAGR from 2010 to 2015.
Today, as we enter another period of higher growth, we believe a higher level of capacity -- of capital intensity is appropriate to capture the future growth opportunities. We now expect a higher growth CAGR in the next few years driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications, which C.C. will discuss in more detail.
We also expect this higher level of capital investment to continue to drive our technology leadership, enable flexible and responsive manufacturing and earn customers' trust. While our leading nodes capital costs continues to increase due to increasing process complexities, it is expected to be compensated by continuing to sell our value, which includes the value of our technology, service, quality and capacity support and diligently working on cost improvement. With this level of CapEx spending in 2021, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. Hi, everyone. This is C.C. Wei. Good afternoon. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
Now let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD 361.5 billion or USD 12.7 billion, which was in line with our guidance mainly due to strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.
Concluding 2020, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory course, was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 20% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue grew 31.4% year-over-year in U.S. dollar term.
Moving into first quarter 2021. Our business continues to be strong, supported by HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to approach the historical season, exceeding 2020, better than our forecast 3 months ago. We observed that the supply chain are changing their approaches to inventory management amidst the lingering macro uncertainties. Looking ahead, we expect the supply chain and our customer to prepare a higher level of inventory compared to the historical season level for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply tightness. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The auto supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continued to decrease their demand in the third quarter. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter. However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex, while many of our technology node has been tight throughout 2020 due to strong demand from our other customers.
Therefore, in the near term, as demand from the automotive supply chain is rebounding, the shortage in automotive supply has become more obvious. In TSMC, this is our top priority, and we are working closely with our automotive customer to resolve the capacity support issues.
Now I will talk about our 2021 outlook. For the full year of 2021, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 10%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by mid-teens percentage in 2021 in U.S. dollar term. Our 2021 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see stronger interest from all 4 growth key focus, which are smartphone, HPC, automotive and IoT.
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We are entering a period of higher growth as a multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021. We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone.
We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance, bandwidth and latency improvement of 5G networks to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multiyear megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all 4 of our growth platform in the next several years.
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing and, therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth.
With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in U.S. dollar terms.
Now I will talk about our N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and volume production is targeted in the second half of 2022.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC 3DFabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3D IC technology road map to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplets and heterogeneous integration technology drive better, power-efficient and smaller-form-factor benefit for our customer while shortening their time to market. This technology is including chip-stacking solution such as SoIC as well as advanced packaging solutions such as InFO and CoWoS. We observed chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3DFabric to enable chiplet architecture.
SoIC's [ full ] volume production is targeted 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where our bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which are including both advanced packaging and testing, to grow at the rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.
This is concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]
Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line. The first one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. So let me ask a question first on 3-nanometer. Dr. Wei, how should we think about the price of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is over the past 2 years, 28-nanometer was a very big node. 7-manometer came out to be roughly 17% bigger if you think about peak revenue compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in.
How is -- given the big CapEx plan that you're also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering how we should kind of think about the size of this sort of node.
And could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities in HPC? Right now, you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers. But could you talk a little bit about CPU, x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind? Could you talk a little bit about how TSMC would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era? Okay. Gokul, sorry, this is Jeff. Let me please summarize your questions, 2 questions. We'll take them in the -- one by one.
Gokul's first question is with regards to 3-nanometer and about the size of our 3-nanometer. He notes that in the past, we have had very big nodes such as 28-nanometer and then 7-nanometer. So Gokul wants to know in terms of the peak revenue contribution, do we expect or should N3 be substantially bigger than N7? That's his first question. Correct? Yes, especially considering the step-up in CapEx as well. Well, Gokul, let me answer your question by saying that we do expect the 3-nanometer will be widely used in HPC-related applications in addition to the smartphones. So with this kind of engagement with our customer, we do expect our revenue will be bigger, certainly. There's no doubt about it. So what is the next question? And then, Gokul, I think the second part of your question is looking at what are our opportunities in high-performance computing. Gokul notes that we have multiple customers engaged, but in particular, he is asking about the progress or the status of CPU opportunity and what do we see as the drivers of HPC. Gokul, we don't specifically name one of our HPC applications such as CPU to say that what is the growth rate. But let me tell you that CPU, networking and AI accelerator will be the main growth area in the HPC applications. Did that answer your question? Could you be a little bit more specific on x86? And then you already had good success in 7-nanometer penetrating the x86 market. Should we think that the x86 market share continues to move up a lot as we get into 3-nanometers? Okay. So Gokul, I guess the -- your question is really on the x86 and looking at 7-nanometer has done well. As we get into 3-nanometer, will our exposure to x86 continue to increase. Again, we don't specifically comment on very specific area. We work with our customers continuously and to supply the very good technology to support their business. Next one to ask questions, Randy Abrams, Crédit Suisse. Okay. Yes. I got 2 questions to ask. First, on the -- you talked about the automotive, and I assume also your mature nodes are very tight. You traditionally haven't added that much capacity on mature nodes and 8-inch. Could you discuss within that, because you have some mix of that, how you're seeing a strategy to add capacity for those nodes? And could you also look at -- auto has been only about 3% of revenue. Should we expect a meaningful pickup in this vertical, both the mature applications and also from new areas like EV and ADAS? Okay. Randy, let me summarize your question. You're asking first on the automotive side. He notes our comments that automotive supply is tight. Do we expect a pickup in the automotive vertical? And then also in looking at the mature nodes, will auto benefit our mature nodes and then ADAS? And other trends in automotive, how do we see? Well, let me say that now we see the automotive industry need a lot of semiconductor component, and that's including the leading-edge technology for the ADAS system and also some of the mature technology for a lot of applications like a sensor, like a power management IC. We do see, right now, it's a little bit shortage on the automotive the mature technology supply. And we are working with customer to mitigate the shortage impact. And then Randy is also asking second part on our mature nodes, given the tightness, will we consider to add capacity for the mature nodes. We always work with our customer to plan our technologies, capacity, all those kind of thing. For mature node, we used to convert some of the large capacity into specialties. Right now, the trend stays the same. Okay. Great. And my second question is, sorry, 2 parts. I just want to ask on gross margin and inventory. The gross margins you've improved 4 points year-over-year. Part of that is utilization, but depreciation also was up 45% NT dollar [ against the ] 6 points. So could you discuss if you've had a breakthrough on the cost reduction side and if now -- I think last quarter, you said about 50%. But given what you've seen on cost reduction and coming off 54%, if you could have better confidence on margin could continue to do better.
And then I just want to ask a quick on inventory, which is up 15 days, historically, you draw down within the fourth quarter, but maybe the trend-wide inventory was rising into early in the year. Okay. Randy, let me summarize your questions, 2 parts. First is on the gross margin, he notes that our gross margin improved throughout the year. And Randy wants to know if there is a breakthrough on the cost side, and therefore, the long-term outlook for our gross margin is still 50% or not. Right. Randy, this is Wendell. You just mentioned that our depreciation increased 45% year-over-year. I think the number should be 15% year-over-year. Okay. I was looking at Q4-to-Q4, I think of just the fourth quarter over fourth quarter. Right. Right. Now in terms of gross margin in the long term, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable. There are 6 factors affecting our profitabilities: the ramp of leading-edge technology, price, cost, mix, utilization and foreign exchange rate. Take foreign exchange rate for example. In 2020, the average dollar against NT rate was TWD 29.43. It is now trading between TWD 27.90 to TWD 28. That is already a 5% appreciation of NT. So every 1% of appreciation of NT will affect our gross margin by 40 basis points.
The other thing is the -- in the fourth quarter of last year, as we mentioned, the utilization rate was very high, extremely high. And that's the abnormal level of high utilization rate cannot sustain. Therefore, in this quarter, we believe the utilization rate will come down a little bit, albeit it is still at a very high level. Now every point of utilization rate change will impact the gross margin by 40 basis point.
A third example will be the ramp in our leading-edge technologies. We mentioned last time that we expect N5 ramp in 2021 to affect our margins by 2 to 3 percentage point, and we still think that will be the case.
So if you take all of those into considerations, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable in the long term. And then Randy had also asked about our days of inventory increasing in fourth quarter. Right. Right. And that's partially because some -- as we have a very high utilization in the fourth quarter, but some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter as opposed to shipped in the fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Next one, we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA. First question is I want to follow up on the gross margin side. So if I look back in the past 2 quarters, the -- your gross margin actual result turned out to be either at the high end or the -- to the upside to your original guidance, while revenue is much on the high end of the guidance, while the Taiwan dollars continued to appreciate in the second half of last year, so which means that the margin turns out to be better than what you originally guided for 2 quarters consecutively. So my question is whether or not the 1Q outlook margin is too conservative again. And second to that is whether our structural profitability will need to revise up just as our 5-year revenue growth CAGR has just been revised up officially. All right. Sebastian, let me summarize your first question, your observation that in the past 2 quarters, our gross margin has come in at the high end or slightly above the high end of our guidance, revenue at the high end, and the currency appreciation is there. So Sebastian's question is, first, is the first quarter gross margin guidance too conservative. And what about the outlook for our longer-term structural profitability, does it need to be revised up? Okay. Sebastian, if we compare fourth quarter to first quarter, 54% in fourth quarter, and the midterm of our guidance for first quarter is 51.5%. The 2.5 percentage point difference actually mainly comes from the utilization as well as the unfavorable foreign exchange rates. So at this moment, we are still sticking to this guidance, although, obviously, we will work hard to continue to improve the gross margins.
As for the long-term gross margin, as I just reported earlier that we are maintaining the 50% gross margin to be reasonable, achievable based on the elements, the 6 factors that I just talked about, each of those factors will affect our growth -- profitability in the long term. Okay. Sebastian, do you have a second question? Yes, I do. My second question is on your CapEx outlook. Apparently that at least there's a significant upside surprise to me and, I think, also to the concensus estimate. So the last time, in the comment, you raised CapEx from $10 billion to $12 billion level to the like a $15 billion to $17 billion level, then that resulted in the 30% revenue growth in 2020. And then -- so my question is that I think that CapEx we invest for the future growth, so whether or not this -- another step-up of the CapEx to like -- to $25 billion to $30 billion these years will represent a reacceleration of the growth in 2022 or '23. Okay. So Sebastian's question is looking at our CapEx guidance for this year, $25 billion to $28 billion. It is above his expectations. So he's looking at the last time we have the increase in acceleration to CapEx from $10 billion to $12 billion to $15 billion to $17 billion resulted in us growing 30% this year -- 31% this year. So what is the outlook for our growth in 2022 or the future years? Okay. Sebastian, it's too early to talk about -- specifically about 2022. But as C.C. mentioned, in the next 5 years, our target CAGR is between 10% to 15%. So that's already higher than the original target of 5% to 10% CAGR that we used to have before the last conference call. And that's also because of the higher capital investment that we are ready to make to capture the higher growth opportunities underpinned by the multiyear megatrends in the industry. Well, let me add something. This is C.C. Wei. This 10% to 15% CAGR is based on a very high number of 2020. So we still forecast 10% to 15% CAGR. That will tell you that how much of CapEx that we need to invest. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian. Next one, we have Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I think the big difference this time is that you raised the long-term revenue CAGR from 5% to 10% to 10% to 15%. Can you tell us that in terms of this kind of incremental changes, how much of the growth is coming from HPC? And what are the drivers for that?
And in terms of the smartphone growth, I mean the 5G penetration is already like 30-something percent in 2021. Moving forward, how much growth for you is coming from the dollar content growth or the shipment growth? Or can you provide more color on the growth? Okay. Bruce, so your question is really about our long-term growth outlook with our growth target CAGR of 10% to 15%. Your question basically is by the different platforms such as HPC, what is the growth contribution; and in looking at smartphone, how much is dollar content, how much is unit contribution. Well, let me answer the question by -- actually, the growth rate from the HPC application is higher than the corporate average. And smartphone is very close to the corporate. And also, automotive is higher than the corporate average; IoT, close to that corporate average. Did that answer your question? Yes. Okay. My next question is I want to ask about the structural profitability. I understand that -- all these 6 factors for the profitability, but that's based on the assumption that structural profitability remain unchanged. So do we consider to move up the structural profitability because of the current supply -- structural growth for the company or the structural tightness for -- especially with legacy technology now? Okay. Bruce, your second question is on the structural profitability. Given the higher growth outlook and also the tightness in supply at legacy nodes or legacy technologies, would we consider to move up the structural profitability target? Bruce, as I just mentioned, we are maintaining the financial objective, i.e., the structural profitability goal of 50% gross margin. And of those 6 factors, every one of them can affect the profitability. For example -- I just used an example in foreign exchange rate, utilization and also the ramp of leading-edge nodes.
And for example, the leading-edge technologies, the complexities increases, the CapEx per K, it's more expensive than before. So we are working very hard with the customer to sell our value, the service value, the technology value and also the capacity value and firm up the wafer price. At the same time, we also work very closely with our suppliers to continue to improve our cost so that altogether, we can maintain and earn a proper return in the leading nodes compared to those of the previous few nodes. As a result, we are maintaining our structured profitability goal as 50% of gross margin. Okay? So -- understand. Let me clarify that whatever you gain in terms of your cost-saving, you will still return it to your customer and maintain your 50% profitability target. It's -- there are 6 factors. So all -- you add all of them together. It's... Understand. Yes. Yes. Thank you, Bruce. The next one to ask question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. So first question is also about the CapEx. So in the past, for you to spend a huge CapEx on leading edge is usually for the smartphone application given that the key user is Apple. So this time, you almost doubled your CapEx level. Does it mean to say there is a significant upside of the Intel CPU outsourcing? This is the first question. Okay, Charlie. So your question is on our CapEx. Basically, Charlie notes that in the past, our large CapEx on leading edge historically has been for smartphone platform. This year, of course, our CapEx number is much higher. So therefore, he is wondering whether it's intended for a particular customer on the CPU side. Well, Charlie, let me answer the question. In fact, we don't comment on specific customer or specific area. Our CapEx guidance is based on the current long-term demand profile underpinned by the industry's megatrend. Okay, Charlie? Yes. And there's... Do you have a second question? Yes, I do. So just some feedback to C.C. I think we all understand the megatrend 5G and HPC. So the last question was just to understand whether there is additional kind of growth driver, for example, IDM outsourcing on top of the organic growth.
But my next question, I think it should be more related to your strategy because I think your existing customer, Intel, 2 days ago, they also commented about don't rule out the possibility of a licensed foundry process. And actually, 20 years ago, back in 2000, I think you also licensed the largest semi process to National Semi. So I'm not sure if TSMC, after 20 years, do you still kind of consider this kind of option, meaning license your foundry process to your IDM customer or even consider some option like a joint venture for the fab operation with your IDM customer. Well, again, we don't comment on a specific topic or a specific customer. But let me tell you that we are working with our customer continuously and to expand the TSMC's business and to support our customers' demand. Thanks, Charlie. Next to ask question, Brett Simpson from Arete Research. A question maybe first for Wendell. So on the revenue guide, I guess you're starting the year with a far better than seasonal Q1. But I just wondered, how do you see the year playing out? Should we expect in the second half a typical seasonality this year?
And then in terms of the CapEx guide for this year, obviously, there's a big step-up. And spending this year is normally a reflection of how you think about long -- future capacity growth beyond 2021. So can we assume from the big increase in CapEx this year that your implied revenue growth in 2022 will be higher than 2021? Okay. So Brett has 2 questions. One, on the revenue guidance of -- we guided for mid-teens for the full year growth for 2021. So he wants to know how does it play out throughout the year. Is there -- second half, will we see the typical seasonality, first half, second half split? That's his first question. Yes. From what we can see now, second half is still higher than the first half. And then the second part is also CapEx and growth. Looking at the increase in our CapEx investment in 2021, noting that we typically spend CapEx in advance of the growth that will follow, Brett wants to know then should we expect a big year or a large growth year in 2000 -- 2022, sorry. Brett, it's -- as I said, it's a bit too early to discuss 2022 in details. But C.C. just mentioned, over the next 5 years, we're looking at a higher range of CAGR.
And also, the CapEx spend this year means future opportunity and growth not just for the next year but also the years after that. So we're looking at multiple years of growth opportunities. Okay? And maybe just one for C.C. Wei on N3. You mentioned N3 would have the best PPA. And we're seeing a lot of transistor innovation at Intel and Samsung in the next couple of years, but you're planning to stick with FinFET at 3-nanometer. And I'm just wondering how you see the transistor density at 3-nanometer. I think at N5, you've talked about 175 million transistors per mil square is the potential of N5. How should we think about N3 in that regard? And relative to some of the transistor innovation we're seeing at Intel and Samsung, are you happy with the FinFET road map? Okay. Brett, so your second question is regards to our N3 and our decision to continue to use FinFET transistor structure at 3-nanometer. You note that at 5-nanometer, we can deliver about 175 million transistors per millimeter square. So you want to know how this falls out at N3 or maybe in terms of our 3-nanometer in comparison to Samsung or others, how does it compare. Well, as I said in my statement that N3 still provide 70% of the logic density gain in addition to all the performance gain and the power reductions. Whether that's at 5-nanometer, you got 175 million transistor per millimeter square, that one depends on -- what the number in N3, I think that will depend on customers' design. We continue to say that we offer the FinFET because of the technology maturity, the performance and the cost are the best combination for TSMC to serve our customer. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Next one, we have Roland Shu from Citigroup. Congrats for the very good results. My first question is also for the CapEx spending, and there are 2 parts of my question. So with this sharply increased CapEx spending, are you considering to sign long-term contracts with customers, especially to those customers who are new to adopt your most leading-edge technology, to ensure a proper return of your investment?
And second part of the first question is this means that you have spent ahead in CapEx in EUV because of the lower productivity for EUV when you first ran EUV. So I would like to know how much CapEx downside you expect after you have improved EUV productivity to the optimized level. Okay. Roland, we'll take your questions one by one. Both of them relate to CapEx. First one is that with the higher level of CapEx that we have in 2021, Roland wants to know that would we consider signing long-term contracts with customers, especially with customers that are new to TSMC, to ensure that we are making a proper return. Roland, signing a contract to guarantee the loading in the future is not our common practice. We always work with our customer and continuous work with customers to serve their demand. And we also put our CapEx or expanding our capacity according to our current long-term demand forecast. All right? And did that answer your question? Okay. Yes. Yes. I take it. Okay, Roland. And then your second question is also related to CapEx. Roland, let me summarize. I think you are saying that in our CapEx guidance, your assumption that the lower productivity of EUV is -- means leading to a higher CapEx level for TSMC. So your question is that if the productivity -- as the productivity of EUV improves, then we'll -- how much reduction in CapEx could we see. Is that your question? Am I summarizing that correctly? Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly. Well, let me answer that. We continue to improve the EUV's productivity because we are working closely with suppliers. And so far, we -- the improvement is obvious but still not up to our expectation yet. As for the CapEx [ won't ] be decreased because of improved productivity, this is in our CapEx plan already. Okay? Okay. Yes. So it means going forward, I mean even you have like higher EUV productivity, the CapEx spending or CapEx -- capital intensity probably would be still high next year or in the near future. Okay. So Roland, his question is that even with EUV productivity and factoring it into our CapEx, that our capital intensity could remain high even into next year. While the CapEx remained high or the CapEx intensity remained high is because of technology complexity, it's actually that N5 is much more complicated than N7, N3 is much more complicated than N5. So most of that CapEx intensity coming from this technology advancement. Of course, EUV is a part of it, but it is not the only one reason. Okay. Thank you, Roland. Okay. Then my second question -- yes? Roland, I think that's 2 questions already, sorry. Because we still have several people in the queue, I would kindly ask you to get back into the queue, so we can allow everyone a chance. The next one, we have Sunny Lin from UBS. My first question is that I want to follow up on 3-nanometer. I think just I want to get a bit of color on your current visibility for the customer adoption into second half of next year, how does it compare with the historical ramp of 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer and also the cost per transistor for 3-nanometer versus 5. Okay. Sunny, so your first question is on 3-nanometer. You want to know the visibility into customer adoption of 3-nanometer into second half 2022 and how does it compare to 5-nanometer or prior nodes; and also, the cost per transistor at 3-nanometer, is it still declining. Let me answer that. The cost per transistor actually continue to decrease. But for your question about engagement with the customer, we see a lot of customers, especially from the HPC field, they are increased -- been engaged with their activity with TSMC. Okay. Sunny, do you have a second question? Right. So just a very quick follow-up to my first question. I wonder if C.C. will be able to provide any color regarding the ramp for 3-nanometer for second half of next year. Okay. So early adoption from our customer is both in smartphone and HPC-related applications. That's all I can say. Got it. And then my second question is for your 2021 gross margin. So with CapEx going up significantly, how should we think about your depreciation growth for this year and also the impact on gross margin? Okay. So Sunny's second question is on the 2021 overall gross margin with a higher level of CapEx spending. She wants to know what will be the year-on-year increase in depreciation and what's the impact to the overall 2021 gross margin. Sunny, the depreciation in 2021 is expected to be between mid- to high-20s percent higher than 2020. And the impact of -- to gross margins, it's too early to talk about the remaining quarters of the 2021. But as a general feeling, if you look at the capacity utilization that I just mentioned, foreign exchange rate unfavorable and also the N5 ramp, negative impact on our profitability, those are the factors that may affect our whole year 2021 gross margin. But as I've said, it's too early to talk about details on the remaining quarters. Okay? Got it. Very helpful. Sure. Thank you, Sunny. Right now, we're having Laura Chen from KGI. Congratulations for the good results and outlook. I also have the question about the CapEx and the gross margin trend. I think given your strong position in the most advanced technology node and an extremely high CapEx in recent years, I believe there must be some strong conviction on the outlook with your major clients.
So can you share with us your view that for the N3, first year contribution will be similar to N5, that will have probably more than 10% revenue for the first year on mass production? Can we expect that to happen?
And also, on the gross margin side, given there might be some swing factor of your major IDM clients for outsourcing opportunity, how would you manage the deterioration rate which may impact your gross margin substantially? That's my first question. Okay. Laura, I think that's 2 questions. But your first question is on the -- yes, on the N3, sort of noting our strong position in the advanced nodes and also the higher CapEx as an indication of the strong conviction on major clients. Laura wants to know what -- will the revenue contribution of 3-nanometer in its first year be similar to -- or how does it compare to 5-nanometer in the first year. Okay. Laura, it's really too early to talk about that at this moment. But as C.C. said, we believe N3, when it's out, is going to be another large and lasting node for TSMC. Okay. Got it. And also... And then -- sorry, go ahead. Yes. On the -- probably the swing factor of the deterioration rate that may impact the gross margin potentially on the -- and particularly for advanced node, how should we look at the trend, how -- your management in that. Okay. So Laura's second question is looking at our gross margin and then also looking at opportunities, for example, in a particular IDM, if there are swings in utilization, how would we manage that and how would that impact the gross margin. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. We don't -- Laura, we don't comment on specific customers or business outlook. The -- what we can say is we continue to work with our customers closely and to ensure that we provide this proper capacity to them. And we also maintain a good utilization out of it. And as Wendell -- yes. Laura, let me add some colors. I think our business has been driven traditionally -- in the past few years by smartphones. Starting from this year on, HPC also jumped on the wagons, and therefore, we're looking -- forward looking, we see the traditional seasonality is -- can be moderated with multiple big customers in multiple market segments. So that's our confidence.
The other confidence is our CapEx includes 3-nanometer, also 5-nanometer. Our 5-nanometer is also very strong, stronger than we expected 3 months ago. So those 2 combined to give us the confidence to increase our CapEx. Okay, Laura? That's very helpful. Yes, that's very helpful. Great. Thank you, Laura. Next one, we have Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Yes, I just got one question, actually. Just could you please then comment more on the wafer shortage situation and how severe it is at present? Which node are you seeing the shortage most acute? Is it 65-, 90-nanometer, 0.11, 0.13, whatever it is? And how far are you essentially booked out at some of these nodes? And do you think there's wafer upside to what you're pricing at these nodes? Okay. So Robert, your question is on the tightness or shortage in the wafer. He is asking, is it a particular node such as 65-nanometer, 90-nanometer, 0.13, how short it is and how long it will last. Robert, most of the shortage actually is in the mature node. It's not in the 3-, not in the 5- or 7-nanometer per se, but in all the mature node, especially in 0.13 micron, in 14-nanometer, in 55-nanometer, in those area. Okay? Can I just have one follow-up, which is just you haven't traditionally built capacity there, but they could become path dependencies for the industry if they are continuing to be short? So would you actually consider building greenfield to help the industry or you think that other foundries will handle that? So Robert, your follow-up question is then given the shortage or tightness on some of these mature nodes, will we consider to expand, build new capacity at these mature nodes to alleviate any potential bottleneck risk. Well, actually, we are working with customer closely and moving some of their mature node to more advanced node, where we have a better capacity to support them. In addition to that, we also try to manage this shortage condition, try to mitigate the impact from this shortage. Okay? Thank you. Next one, we have Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities. Yes, this is Rick. My first question is I guess you guys mentioned that now your customers are happy living with a higher inventory than the historical pattern because of the macro uncertainties such as COVID-19, so I wonder if your customer would still be happy living with a high inventory than the normal historical patterns if the virus -- if COVID-19 is contained. So this is my first question. Okay. Thank you, Rick. So your question is our -- the higher level of inventory that we're seeing partly is attributable to COVID-19. What if COVID-19 is no longer -- everyone has vaccine, then it's no longer an issue. Will this continue? Yes, that's right. Yes, first, let's say that we really hope that the vaccine will work and -- but even if it's working, it takes time. And then also our customers still -- today, they still have a different approach for the inventory management, as we said, because of the secure of the supply is more important than anything you are seeing in today's situation. So we don't think it's really to revert back to the historical level of the inventory. Okay. That's helpful. My second question is also regarding your CapEx because the number this year is really high. So about 80% of your high CapEx this year is going to be spent for leading edge, so I wonder how much of that portion is actually for preparation of a capacity build for 2022 and beyond, not for this year. So can you share your idea with us? Okay. So Rick, your question is on our CapEx. 80% -- about 80% is for the advanced nodes. He wants to know how much of this spending for the advanced nodes is in preparation for capacity for 2000 -- sorry, 2022. Rick, we invest this year -- actually, for future year primarily. So it's not only for 2022, it may also be for the years following that. So that's -- I think that's something that I'd like to share with you. Okay? Okay. That's helpful. Yes. Yes, no problem. Thank you, Rick. Next one, we have Andrew Lu from Sinolink Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Okay. My first question is, if your customer has his own design rule, knows what's the different metal and poly pitch spec for TSMC's one, can this customer use the in-house manufacturing and TSMC foundry based on the same design? Or he needs to redesign the chip based on TSMC 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer design rule? Okay. Andrew, let me try to summarize your question. Your question is about customers' design rules. If the customer has their own design rules but with different metal and different poly pitch from TSMC's, could this customer use TSMC foundry or use their in-house manufacturing? Or do they need to use TSMC's design rules, basically? That's correct. Andrew, we always work closely with our customer to support their design into TSMC subprocess technologies, so we can manufacture it inside TSMC. So customer doesn't need to change his own design? Okay. I cannot answer this question because of -- it is 2 parties' cooperation. And as I said, we work closely with them to support their design. Okay? Understood. Yes. My second question is, since our 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer nodes will be ramping up next year, what about second half this year, will we have something like a 5-nanometer plus or revision, 5-nanometer process node for second half this year. Okay. So Andrew's second question is, looking at second half of this year, noting that next year we'll have, for example, N3 and N4, then second half of this year, do we have any new node or continuous improvement, enhancement? Andrew, we always continue to improve the technologies. Last year, we introduced our 5-nanometer to the market. This year, we continue to improve it. And next year, we will improve further. So we never stop. Okay? So something like the 5-nanometer plus? If that's what you are naming, yes. Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next one, we have Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Yes. First question has to do with the revenue mix forecast for Q1 by technology and platform. It will be great if you could provide some color, and I have a follow-up. Okay. So Mehdi wants to know for the first quarter, revenue by technology and revenue by platform. Okay. Mehdi, in the first quarter, HPC, automotive and IoT will increase sequentially, while smartphone will experience a milder seasonal decline compared to its recent seasonalities. And we do not provide a breakdown guidance of revenue by technology, Mehdi, okay? So do you have a second question? Yes. Just a quick follow-up on CapEx. Does your $25 billion to $28 billion CapEx guide include investment for infrastructure in U.S.? So Mehdi's question is does our CapEx guidance this year include any investment for the U.S. fab infrastructure. Yes, it does. The U.S. fab starts construction this year. Okay? Can you elaborate that how much of the CapEx is for the U.S.? Not at this point. Right. Okay? Thank you, Mehdi. Next one, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Yes. I also had 2 on CapEx. Number one, pretty nice step-up in CapEx this year from last year. Is it fair to assume your investment in EUV is also up this year relative to last year? And then I had a follow-up. Okay. So Krish's first question is that with our increase in CapEx guidance -- that we guided for in 2021 versus 2020 being an increase, does that also mean an increase in the CapEx we spend on EUV. No, we do not disclose that details. Got it. And then as a follow-up, C.C., you mentioned that how capital intensity is going to be high all the way to 3-nanometer. But you also said long-term capital intensity should be in the mid-30s, so I'm just trying to square that by what do you mean by long term? Because it looks like if 3-nanometer is still going to be high for the next few years, capital intensity might be higher than mid-30s. So at what point should we expect it to get to mid-30s? Okay. So Krish's second question is in terms of capital intensity. With the capital intensity or CapEx per K at 3-nanometer being higher, and then we're having a long-term capital intensity returning to mid-30s, he wants to know when will we return to mid-30s capital intensity level. Is that correct, Krish? Yes. Yes. Yes. We mean long term meaning 3 to 5 years. I think 2010 to 2014 can be an example. During that period of time, the capital intensity rose from 38% to 50%, maintaining at high 40s for a couple of years and came down afterwards. Something like that should be a reference. Okay? All right. Thanks, Krish. Next one, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Yes. One question on CapEx and depreciation. Do we -- are we having to spend CapEx a little bit ahead of what we used to spend in the past -- in the EUV era? Is that a function of having to spend maybe 6 to 9 months ahead compared to, let's say, in the immersion era? That's one.
And how should we think about depreciation with this jump in CapEx? Wendell, can you give us a little bit of guidance in terms of how we should think about depreciation for this year and going ahead as well given the higher level of CapEx? Okay. Gokul, let me summarize. Your first question is in terms of the CapEx. He wants to know that are we -- with CapEx, are we having to spend CapEx earlier now and is this because of EUV that we need to spend more CapEx earlier. Well, let me answer the question. The answer is yes because of, yes, a long lead time for the EUV tools. The tools are very complicated, and the supply chain for the EUV takes a long time to prepare for it. And as a result, TSMC also has to plan in advance. That's longer than the normal tools that we used to have. Okay. And then Gokul's second question is looking at with the higher CapEx, the depreciation outlook. Right. For this year, Gokul, we expect the depreciation to increase by mid-20% to high 20% for 2021 over 2020. Okay, Gokul? Okay. Yes. And maybe to just add -- yes. So even with that, we are comfortable with the 50% structural gross margin. So even with the higher growth and depreciation, Gokul is asking are we still comfortable with a 50% gross margin. Yes. 50% gross margin as a long-term target, we think it's reasonable and achievable. Okay. Operator, in the interest of time, I think we'll take the last 2 callers. Okay. The next caller is Randy Abrams, Crédit Suisse. Okay. Yes, my first follow-up on U.S. and China, your overseas sites. For the U.S. site, you bought 1,100 acres. Do you have plans to build out a mega fab or potential to build out multi-phase of 20K wafers? And then for the China business post-Huawei, where it's down to single digits, how's your outlook for the China and also expansion of the China from 20K? Okay. So Randy, your first question is regards to capacity and fab expansion overseas. So Randy is asking in the U.S., in Arizona, we target 20K, do we -- will we continue to build it out into a mega fab type of site. And he also wants to know in China, and I guess you're referring to Nanjing, do we have plans to further expand the capacity in Nanjing. Is that your question, correct, Randy? Yes, that's the question, just the outlook to rebound China just post-HiSilicon, where it's down to mid-single-digit contribution. Yes, this is Mark. Let me take your question. Yes, we recently acquired a big piece of land in Phoenix, 1,100 acres. Definitely, that was the long-term plan to have a mega-scale production sites. But currently, our plan is only work on the Phase 1 production and talk in 2024 with 20,000 wafer per month. And we'll -- going forward, we'll see according to the market condition and the cost economics and provided by the government support to mend the cost differences to decide the next steps.
On China, yes, we do have plan to continue to expand in China. But of course, the business in China after leading edge will -- does have a reset. But we do expect the demand in China will continue, and we will gradually, accordingly increase our capacity in Nanjing. Okay. Okay. Great. And my second question is if you could give -- I think you gave first quarter, but the full year growth for each of the platforms. And also for the back end, where you're doubling CapEx, what's leading that investment between the InFO, CoWoS, SoIC in growth outlook for back end? Okay. So Randy is asking about 2021 growth, first, growth outlook by platform and then growth outlook by the back end; and then between the back end, InFO, CoWoS, by segment. Okay. Randy, for 2021 by platform, we think HPC and automotive growth will be higher than the corporate average growth. Smartphone and IoT will be similar to the corporate average growth in U.S. dollar terms. In terms of our back-end business, we expect it to grow slightly higher than the corporate in 2021. We do not disclose details within the back-end business. Okay? Okay. All right. Thanks, Randy. The next one, we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA. Yes. Two follow-up. The first one is to follow on Mark's comments that, yes, I think Mark previously said that the company has noted 5-nanometer demand also stronger than you thought 3 months ago. So I would be curious about if you can give us more details about which applications are you seeing a stronger-than-expected demand. HPC, high-performance computing. So for hybrid computing is the typical, those customer electronics or is more typical HPC or blockchain related? Sorry, I didn't hear the -- we didn't hear the last part, Sebastian. Yes, I'm sorry. I was saying that for the HPC part, is it more related to your existing customers or more related to the blockchain-related products? Let me add a little bit color on this. High-performance computing, as Wendell just said, will be the major growth driver of our business. And this field is currently under exciting changes. As the high-performance computing's architectures, as you know, from different customers, everybody is striving to get the best performance with different architectures. So many, many -- many more players are getting into this field. So we see a stronger innovation is coming our way on N3 as well as on N5, yes. Okay. Okay. That's good. Cryptocurrency -- it's not on cryptocurrency, Sebastian. We don't count on that, but we support that, yes. Okay. Yes, that's fair. And the second follow-up is a follow-up to Wendell's comments on that I think in this year is, based on the guidance, that we will see the CapEx intensity to go up to 50%. So if we calculate -- based on the revenue guidance, if we do some calculations, which means the free cash flow for this year could be -- the growth will likely to be -- will be pretty small or even flat, depends on how things go, but definitely not as strong as past few years. So my question is that is the company still sticking to the dividend policy that is 70% of free cash flow? Okay. So Sebastian, your question is then in looking at the CapEx, looking at our revenue guidance, the capital intensity this year being about around 50%, then the free cash flow growth may slow this year. So what is the outlook for the dividend? Do we still use 70% of free cash flow as the cash dividend formula? Right. Sebastian, our dividend policy has 2 parts, 70% of free cash flow but not to be lower than the previous period. So we remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend. During the periods of higher investments, the focus will be more on sustainable. And as we harvest the growth, the focus will be on steadily increasing. Okay. So given that you're paying the -- the investor is getting the dividend in this quarter, which is the earnings you made like 3 quarters earlier, so if we do the calculation simulation, which means that in the next 24 months, the investor will probably still getting the TWD 2.50 per quarter. Is that a fair calculation assumption? At least. At least. Okay? Okay. All right. Thanks, Sebastian. Okay. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session.

The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2021 followed by our guidance for the second quarter 2021. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter 2021. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2021.
First quarter revenue increased 0.2% sequentially in NT dollars or 1.9% in U.S. dollars. Our first quarter business was supported by HPC-related demand, balanced by a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Gross margin decreased 1.6 percentage points sequentially to 52.4%, mainly due to relatively lower level of capacity utilization and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expenses slightly increased by TWD 0.8 billion, mainly due to higher level of R&D activities for the N5 family. Therefore, operating margin decreased by 2 percentage points sequentially to 41.5%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 5.39, and ROE was 29.5%. 
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 14% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 35%. Advanced technologies, which we now define as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 49% of wafer revenue.
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 11% quarter-over-quarter to account for 45% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 13% to account for 35%. IoT increased 10% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 32% to account for 4%. DCE increased 10% to account for 4%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 797 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 45 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 49 billion in short-term loans, an increase of TWD 50 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 51 billion in accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 23 billion, mainly as we raised TWD 21.1 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days increased 1 day to 40 days. Days of inventory increased 10 days to 83 days, primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 228 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 248 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for second quarter 2020 cash dividend. Short-term loans increased by TWD 52 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 18.5 billion due to the bond issuance. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 4.6 billion to TWD 665 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $8.8 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our second quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 12.9 billion and USD 13.2 billion, which represents a 1% sequential increase at the midpoint. This revenue guidance includes the minor impact from the power outage that occurred yesterday at our Fab 14 in Tainan.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.4, gross margin is expected to be between 49.5% and 51.5%, operating margin between 38.5% and 40.5%. The sequential decline in second quarter gross margin is mainly due to the margin dilution from higher 5-nanometer contribution, the slower rate of cost improvement as our fabs continue to run at a very high level of utilization and the absence of positive inventory revaluation. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 362.4 billion or USD 12.9 billion, which was in line with our guidance. The slight sequential increase was mainly driven by HPC-related demand, balanced by a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Moving into second quarter 2021, we expect our revenue to be flattish as HPC-related demand will continue to grow, offset by smartphone seasonality.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was healthy exiting fourth quarter of 2020. Amidst the lingering macro and supply uncertainties, we expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare higher levels of inventory throughout the year as compared to the historical seasonal level. We expect this to persist for a period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout the year supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and special technology.
For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 12% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 16%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by around 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we enter a period of higher growth underpinned by the multiyear structural megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications, we believe a higher level of capital investment is necessary to capture the future growth opportunities.
In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have decided to raise our full year 2021 CapEx to be around USD 30 billion. About 80% of the 2021 capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
First, let me talk about the capacity shortage and demand outlook. Our customers are currently facing challenges from the industry-wide semiconductor capacity shortage, which is driven by both structural increase in long-term demand as well as short-term imbalance in the supply chain. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand as multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's life.
In addition, the need to ensure supply security is creating short-term imbalance in the supply chain, driven by supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.
Now let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logical IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers' growth, TSMC is taking several action to help address the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.
To address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile, we are working closely with our customers and investing to support their demand. We have acquired land and equipment and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousand of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expect to invest about USD 100 billion through the next 3 years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing and R&D of leading-edge and specialty technologies. Increased capacity is expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and help strengthen confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.
Our capital investment decision are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes and rising material costs. Therefore, we will continue to work closely with customers to share our value. Our value includes the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers. We are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level. We will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement.
By taking such actions, we believe we can continue to earn a proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and fulfill our mission as trusted foundry partners. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply update. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The automotive supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continued to reduce their demand throughout the third quarter of 2020. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter of 2020.
However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex with its own inventory management practices. From chip production to car production, it takes at least 6 months with several tiers of suppliers in between. TSMC is doing its part to address the chip supply challenges for our customers.
In January of this year, TSMC announced that capacity support for automotive customers is our top priority. Since then, we have worked dynamically with our other customer to reallocate our wafer capacity to support worldwide automotive industry. However, the shortage further deteriorated due to the unexpected snowstorm in Texas and the fab manufacturing disruption in Japan. Together with our productivity improvement, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC's customer by the next quarter.
Now I will talk about Taiwan water supply update. The water supply in Taiwan is currently tight due to the lack of rainfall in the past year. We have been prepared for this. TSMC has a long-established enterprise risk management system in place, which cover water supply risk as well. Through our existing water-conservation measures, we are able to manage the current water usage reduction requirement from the government with no impact on our operations. We also have detailed response procedure to handle water shortage at different stages. We will continue our collaborative effort with the government and the private sector on water conservation and new water sources. With our comprehensive enterprise risk management system, we do not expect to see any material impact to our operations.
Finally, I will talk about the N5 and N3 status. TSMC's N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in its second year of volume production with yield better than our original plan. N5 demand continue to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications, and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021.
N4 will leverage the strong foundation of N5 to further extend our 5-nanometer family. N4 is a straightforward migration from N5 with compatible design rules while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next wave of 5-nanometer products. N4 risk production is targeted for second half this year and volume production in 2022. Thus, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications.
N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We continue to see a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone applications at N3 as compared with N5 and N3 at a similar stage.
Risk production is scheduled in 2021. The volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology, which it is introduced -- when it's introduced, I'm sorry. Thus, we are confident that both our 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer will be large and long-lasting nodes for TSMC.
This is concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]
Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can you please proceed with the first caller on the line? The first one to ask question, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. Okay. Yes. And I wanted to ask the first question just about Intel. They did announce their plans to reengage in the foundry sector and also, I think making it clear, their goals are to get back to manufacturing leadership. So could you discuss how you're viewing them now as a customer and also the assurances you're getting in business sustainability and how you're managing the potential risk if they improve manufacturing and pull back on some of the outsourcing plans? Okay. Randy, let me summarize your first question. Randy's first question relates to Intel and their recent announcement to reengage on foundry and get back to a manufacturing leadership position. So Randy's question is how does TSMC view Intel as a customer? What kind of business assurances are we getting on the sustainability of the business? And how do we manage any of the potential risks? Randy, let me start with TSMC is everyone's foundry and support all our customer openly and fairly. Intel is an important customer, and we will collaborate in some areas and compete in other area. And we always work with our customer to develop the necessary technology to support their products.
Now let me comment a little bit on the competition. As a leading pure-play foundry, TSMC has never been short on competition in our 30-plus-year history, and we know how to compete. We are -- we will continue to focus on delivering technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and earning our customers' trust. The last point, customers' trust, is fairly important because we do not have internal products that compete with our customer. So we can be the trusted technology and capacity provider and for years to come.
And if you ask other comment, how we support Intel, we support them as an important customer. And we plan our capacity for the long-term industry megatrend also. It's not for the short-term demand. Okay. Does that answer your first question, Randy? Yes. No, that's good on the first question. The second question and topic I wanted to discuss, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the -- there is a bit more geopolitical pressure with -- particularly U.S. but also Europe and China. They all are being aggressive about domestic capacity. If you could give an updated view on your strategy, if any shifts at the margin where you've traditionally wanted the high scale in Taiwan.
I'm curious for U.S. with the big land, just any plans to accelerate positioning with the potential eventually to do mega fab?
If you could give an update on Nanjing, if there's plans to expand from the current -- I think you're at 20,000. And, if from a customer level, you're seeing shifts where more customers are starting to consider geographic location in the foundry consideration. Okay. Randy, let me try to summarize your second question. I think there's quite a few parts. I think, first, Randy's question is on looking at sort of the geopolitical landscape and looking at this talk of fabs in different countries. So I think Randy, first, wants to know what is our progress or how do we see particularly U.S  manufacturing; secondly, in other areas; and then thirdly, he would like an update on the Nanjing expansion; and lastly, how do customers feel about the need to manufacture in different countries. Is that correct, Randy? Yes. That's correct. Yes. Randy, that's a lot of questions. Sorry. You only give us 2. Let me try to answer. The first one, actually, I would like to say TSMC have been a global company. We have a lot of manufacturing sites outside Taiwan, U.S., Mainland China, Singapore.
But let me comment on the U.S. first. We have been in the U.S. for a long time, though. We set up WaferTech, that's an 8-inch fab located in upstate Washington back in 1996 and it's continued to operate and manufacture chips for our customers today. And now we are increasing our presence in the U.S. with an advanced 12-inch semiconductor fab in Arizona and the progress is executing to our plan. And we are happy that we are joining the effort to support semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.
You also asked about our status in Nanjing. Did -- that you asked? Yes. Yes. The fab in Nanjing is progressing well. We already completed the first phase of 20,000-wafers capacity installation, and actually, it's in production for a while. And we are -- we also have a plan. Depend on the customers' demand and depends on the economics, we have a plan to expand the capacity also, okay?
And other question in Taiwan, why we... Also, 2 others. One, Randy is asking with other regions also. We never rule out any possibility with other region. But today, we already announced plan. We currently have no further fab expansion plan in other areas such as Europe. But we did not rule out any possibility.
However, I want to emphasize, Taiwan will continue to be the main focus for TSMC. Our center of R&D and majority of production line will continue to be located in Taiwan, okay? Did that answer your questions? Yes. That's clear. And maybe if you can clarify, for customer decisions, just that approach with Taiwan, is there -- are you starting to see it get raised a bit more about customers choosing location? Or are they still focused on the traditional, just getting the best PPA, the best cost and delivery time? Right. So Randy's -- the last part of his question is, from a customer's perspective, is there a push by customers for this geographic diversification? Or what do customers want? Well, our customer welcome we established a new fab in Arizona state. Let me say that. However, the most important one to them is technology, is the manufacturing, is the efficiency that TSMC provides, okay? Actually, that's the most important one other than the consideration of geopolitical locations. Okay, Randy? Thank you, Randy. All right. Next one on the line, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. My first question, could we talk a little bit about the $100 billion capacity plan for the next 3 years? Is that primarily a CapEx number? Just as you -- just seeing that this year already, we are spending about $30 billion. Should we be assuming that our CapEx is going to run around these levels or even higher in the next 2 years as well? So just wanted to clarify because there was some confusion about whether that's a CapEx number or a CapEx plus R&D number. Okay. So I think, Gokul, your first question is that we intend to spend $100 billion in the next 3 years. Is that a CapEx number? And then also, what does that mean for the spending of the CapEx in the next 2 years? Gokul, this is Wendell. Yes, $100 billion is CapEx number. Now we've already guided that this year will be $30 billion, but we're not going into the linearity in the next 2 years. You can actually have a feeling about what we will be spending in the next 2 years. Got it. That's very clear. My second question is on the inventory cycle and a lot of the capacity expansion that we are seeing in older technologies. TSMC also is spending about roughly $3 billion based on the new guidance on specialty technologies as well. The industry also seems to be spending quite a bit of capacity there.
What is TSMC's stake in terms of when we are going to see a bit more normalization in some of this older capacity? Does TSMC also subscribe to the view that even in 2022, we are likely to see some degree of capacity tightness or capacity shortage or TSMC feels that we will likely resolve this towards the end of this year or early next year? Okay. Gokul, thank you. Let me try to summarize your second question. Your second question is looking -- asking about the inventory cycle and particularly on the mature nodes, looking at the expansion in the mature nodes. And Gokul wants to know, I think, that on the mature nodes, could we see some type of overcapacity and can the tightness continue to persist? Or will we start to see some kind of overcapacity or oversupply towards the end of this year or in 2022? Is that correct, Gokul? Yes. Just to highlight, I think many of your competitors are talking about 2022 also being undersupplied in many of these process nodes. Just wanted to hear TSMC's view on that. Well, Gokul, let me answer the question carefully because of -- we cannot rule out the possibility of an inventory correction or overbooking, something like that. But actually, we expect the structural demand to continue and we will work with our customer closely actually to develop some technology solution to meet customers' requirement and create differentiation and long-lasting value to our customer.
As a result, we -- actually, we see the demand continue to be high. And the shortage will continue throughout this year and may be extended into 2022 also. Did that answer your questions? Okay. So do you also feel that customers will continue to hold down to a higher level of inventory for quite some period of time? Is that the way you think about inventory as well? Yes. We expect the customer, almost all of them, to prepare a higher level of inventory. That is because of, today, geopolitical tension continue to persist. Even the COVID-19 will recede sometimes -- we hope as soon as possible, but it will continue for a while. And put 2 factor together and we do expect them to prepare a higher level of inventory, and I believe we're already seeing that. Yes. Okay, Gokul? Does that answer your second question? Thank you. Now we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA. So first one is on the pricing strategy. So I remember, 6 months ago, the company talked about sticking to the principle of respecting long-term partnership with customers. And the company doesn't seem to want to change the pricing on the mature technology nodes, which I mean 28 nanometers above. So I'm wondering if that's still the case now or if the company now considers some upward adjustment? And if it's the latter, what has changed versus 6 months ago? Okay, Sebastian. So Sebastian's first question is -- regards to pricing. And he says that we always talk about long-term partnership with our customers. And he's saying, in particular, on the older nodes, 28-nanometer and such, we -- would we raise the price? So he's asking sort of what is the pricing strategy today and what has changed versus previously? Sebastian, let me answer that. For more than 30 years, TSMC has provided stable and predictable pricing, and we have refrained from opportunistic or short-term actions.
But now as I said in my statement, the cost structure start to change, structural change, because of -- we have to invest on the leading-edge technology, which is more complex than ever. And we also increased the mature technology node capacity, which a lot of them already been fully depreciated and now we have to invest on the new tools.
So we refrain from opportunistic and short-term action, but we also had to share our value. So we are working with our customer closely, and we want to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level. And we also work with our supplier to deliver the cost reduction, and we want to earn a proper return that enable us to continue to invest to support our customers' growth. And in today's term, capacity support is the most important one they are looking for. Okay. Okay. Got it. That's fair. And my... Do you have a second question? Yes. Sorry, go ahead. Yes. I do have a second question. I think we're -- for many reasons, we have seen in many countries, globally, they plan or they want to increase their -- build their own semiconductor fabrication capacity domestically. We're also seeing some IDM, they are forced to increase their in-sourcing or add some internal capacity because of the chip crunch. So my question is that IDM outsourcing has been one favorable driver for the foundry industry and TSMC growth in the past 3 decades and how TSMC see this trend evolving in coming years. And would you be concerning this could lead to some overcapacity in a few years even if some of those may not be effective? That is my second question. Okay. Sebastian, let me summarize your question. Your observation that countries are pushing for more domestic manufacturing and IDMs are also looking at expanding capacity. So Sebastian's question is looking at IDM outsourcing. Do we see this trend slowing down? Or how do we see it in the next coming few years? And could this result, this capacity that's being built, result in excess capacity? Well, Sebastian, let me say that in our long-term forecast, we continue to see the IDMs outsourcing continue to increase. And so we prepare the capacity for that also. And we don't think that IDM try to expand their own capacity will result in overcapacity situation because of we -- technology is the most important thing, let me say that. And we expand our capacity based on the customers' need. And we saw the technology leadership that provided their product to be very competitive in the market. So they are all happy to work with TSMC in developing their product for now, for the future. And so as a result, we continue to see the increased outsourcing from IDMs. Okay. Sebastian, does that answer your second question? Yes. Yes, it does. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. So first of all, can I ask about the change of the 2021 revenue guidance? Can you explain where is the upside coming from, I mean, by applications will be great. And does that include some pricing adjustments for those revised in the guidance? All right. I think Charlie's first question is relating to our 2021 revenue guidance from now of around 20% to say what has changed versus last time. And he also wants to know, can we talk about, by application, what is driving this change.
And what was the last part of your question, Charlie? Sorry. Actually, that's it. And does that include -- capture some price hike as well? So his question is what is driving the change in the growth guidance for this year. And he would like to know which applications are driving it. And does it include some price increases in this guidance? Okay. Charlie, first of all, we don't comment on price. I can share with you that we're everyone's foundry. Our CapEx and capacity planning are based on the long-term demand profile underpinned by the industry megatrends, not short-term cyclical factors. We are seeing stronger engagements with more customers on 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer as compared to 3 months ago. And we work closely with our customers to plan the capacity, and we'll continue to focus our investments on advanced and specialty technology to support our customers' structural growth.
Now this year, we expect -- in terms of platform, we expect that HPC and automotive platform growth will be higher than the corporate average, and the smartphone and IoT will be close to the corporate average. Okay. Understood. So it seems like the upside coming cross-border or just some specific application. I know that HPC and automotive are growing better. But just compared to last guidance, what was driving the upside? Okay. Actually, all the platforms have upside compared to 3 months ago. Okay. Got you. And then my next question is about your capital intensity in the long term. I mean I think 1 or 2 quarters ago, company updated capital intensity, and at some point, can flow back to like 35% capital intensity. I'm not sure if that's the case for the coming 3 years.
And also, linked to that, what does that mean to the long-term gross margin trend? Because in today's conference call, I keep hearing some comments about structural cost increase. I'm not sure you said about the chemicals or equipment price. Would that kind of impact company's long-term gross margin trend? Sure. Charlie, let me share with you. Capital -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yes. It's okay. Yes, I think, Charlie, your question is on capital intensity, looking at what is the capital intensity looking like in the next few years. And how does this correlate with our stated long-term capital intensity of kind of mid-30s range? And then he also -- on the back of that, what does this mean for the long-term gross margin trend? Okay. Charlie, in terms of capital intensity, we -- I've actually given out several points already. First of all, if you look at -- we're saying in the next 3 years, we'll be spending USD 100 billion and this year will be $30 billion. We also say that in the next 5 years, we expect to grow between 10% to 15% revenue CAGR. So if you do math, you probably will have a good idea about where our capital intensity will be in the next 3 years. Now at this moment, we still expect that the capital intensity will go back to mid-30 level in the longer term. That's the capital intensity.
In terms of gross margins, I think as C.C. has already mentioned, we see some challenges from manufacturing costs due to the increasing complexity of leading nodes, the new investment in mature nodes and some rising material costs. And therefore, we are taking actions to ensure that we earn a proper return by firming up our price, working with the supplier to drive the cost improvement. We expect that the 50% gross margin remains our target and is achievable. Okay? Okay. Yes. That's very, very clear. So I -- so can I assume part of that $100 billion CapEx also associated to a cost increase? And if that's the case, how much of that is due to the cost increase versus the demand? This is -- I think the last part of his question is that then out of the $100 billion and this higher capital intensity, how much is due to the cost versus the demand. Yes. Exactly. Okay. Charlie, basically, we're seeing more engagement of our demand in the next few years. So I would say most of the CapEx come from the strong demand for our advanced technology and specialty technology, especially 5 and 3 nanometers. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. Next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. My question, I'll just stick with the $100 billion CapEx. I mean, I think this is the first time for TSMC to announce a multiyear CapEx. I think this suggests very, very strong growth even beyond 2023, over $300 billion and plus. So can you give us a little bit more color about like what kind of application demand, which is strong enough to give the company such a high confidence for the CapEx? I mean we've seen through several cycles, but how can we have confidence for the demand, like 3 to 5 years down the road?
Also, assuming TSMC mostly invests in advanced nodes, do you foresee the material capacity tightness continue and how and when this can be resolved? Okay. So Bruce has 2 questions. Both -- first is related to our CapEx. With such a high level of spending, what is giving us the confidence that we see out over the next several years to spend -- an intention to spend this $100 billion? And then his second -- well, maybe we'll go that first and then second question. Okay. Let me answer that one first. In fact, we are seeing stronger engagement with more customers on 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. And the engagement is so strong that we have to really prepare the capacity for it. And that's the main reason. So what is the second? And then his second question is then looking at our CapEx, with the majority of our CapEx being on advanced nodes, on the mature nodes then, will the, I think, the supply-demand gap in mature nodes further widen? We did see the gap that mature node capacity not enough to support all the products in the market. So we are working with our customer closely to analyze the gap, and we are also preparing to invest on the mature node, as I said in my statement. But most important, we are developing the technology, specialty technology, with the mature node and to support our customers' need so their product can be very competitive in the market. And so we can have demand secured for the next few years and we decide to invest on the mature node capacity. Okay. Bruce, does that answer your 2 questions? Okay. Can I take one? We have to limit to 2, sorry. There's a lot of people still waiting. Thank you. Next one to ask questions, Rob Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Yes. My first question is regarding your CapEx rising up to the mid-30s by 2023. Are you asking customers to commit earlier than normal on that capacity? And are you considering asking customers for prepayments? How do you derisk those capacity plans? And are you seeing an increased willingness to single source?
My second question was how far are you actually booked out on capacity? And at which node is the biggest gap between demand and your capacity? Okay. Robert, we'll take your questions one at a time. So his first question is looking at our CapEx for the next few years, with this level of spending, do we see customer commitments that are earlier than normal? Are we looking for things like prepayments from customers to secure their commitments? This is the first question. Okay. Robert, let me answer this first. The $100 billion CapEx is decided because we see the fundamental structure demand increase from the megatrend, multiyear megatrend and the acceleration of the digital transformations.
Now we cannot disclose the detail of our commercial terms with our customers. However, for us to make the investment decision, we'll definitely require proper returns and secure customer commitments. Okay. And then Robert's second question is how far are we booked in advance in terms of our demand and which nodes do we see the biggest gap between what customers may want. Well, I cannot comment on which node because almost all the nodes are in -- today is high demand. However, let me stress again that our investment in the capacity is for the future, many years to come because we work with customer closely to plan for the next few years as capacity support to them. And the customer talking to TSMC and layout their product plan for the next few years, it is 3 to 4 years, and we plan the capacity for that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, C.C. Thank you, Robert. Now we have Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Yes. I had a question on the crypto activity at TSMC. I guess we've seen record hash rate expansion around Bitcoin ASICs and GPU mining in the last couple of quarters. So can you maybe share with us what portion of sales -- HPC sales is crypto at the moment? And then as we get into the second half of the year, should we expect this to decline? And I wanted to get your perspective. A couple of years ago, we had extreme volatility around crypto. Bitcoin is now $1 trillion market cap. Is this good business for TSMC? Do you think this time will be different? I just wanted to get your perspective on this. Okay. So let me repeat your first question, Brett. He's asking about -- within HPC, looking at cryptocurrency, and he's asking what is the contribution we're seeing from cryptocurrency -- or crypto mining, I should say, to our revenue. And do we expect this -- how do we expect this to go in the second half of this year? And then a longer-term question, which is how do we view this business. Let me answer the question. TSMC's technology is a leading technology, and that's why even cryptocurrencies mining using TSMC technology a lot. But I don't -- and I cannot comment on what is the percentage or how much of this particular market sector to our revenue. However, I can say that cryptocurrency mining today is more mature than it was 2 or 3 years ago. And it remains a volatile market. However, we will continue to work closely with our customers in this field. Okay, Brett? And do you have a second question? Yes, I did. Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. I wanted to  talk about the inventory levels at TSMC at present. It grew quite significantly. And I think you mentioned that it was N5 related. Now many of your smartphone customers are saying they have shortages at leading edge and you're building inventories at 5-nanometer. So how do we reconcile that? And then just looking at Q2, would you expect inventories to rise again in the June quarter? Okay. Brett, so you're asking about TSMC's inventory days, right? And so Brett is asking what is leading to the increase in the inventory days at the end of first quarter. And then how do we expect this to trend in the second quarter? Okay, Brett. We prebuild for our customers during seasonal low level as we did before. Now when we start to ramp in the higher season, the inventory usually come down naturally as before. Okay. Does that answer your question? Yes. Now please welcome Roland Shu from Citigroup. My first question is also for this $100 billion CapEx. Can you clarify, is this year's CapEx of $30 billion included in this $100 billion or not?
And also, I use your long-term capital intensity target. Last time, you said long term is 3 to 5 years. And then I use this above $30 billion CapEx maybe in 2024. Then it implies your revenue in 2024 will likely to exceed $90 billion or even bigger, which is more than double than 2020 level. So my question is, are there any challenges to you to recruit and train up enough amount of the talent to support such a fast growth for you going forward? Okay. Let me summarize your questions, Roland. So first, Roland is asking this $100 billion CapEx. Does this include 2021 of around $30 billion?
And then he's asking about if we look at the longer-term capital intensity, what does this kind of imply for 2024 and '25 CapEx and capital intensity? And then another part is that with this pace of growth, how do we recruit the talent to support our operations? Roland, yes, $100 billion include this year's CapEx. And we've talked about the 3-year, $100 billion, '21, '22 and '23. The capital intensity, I think, as I said earlier, you can probably do some calculation and have a feeling about the capital intensity in those 3 years. Longer term, we do see that the capital intensity will go back to about mid-30s level at this moment. And his second question is then how do we recruit talent to support our growth. Roland, this is a very good question. Very good question. The talent people recruiting is one of our top priorities in recent years. And fortunately, we have communicated with the government and get Taiwan government's strong support. So they are now pushing for a new program to hire -- not to hire, to actually to lure the student to be in the semiconductor area, major in this area.
And internally, TSMC also have a very [ robust ] system. Right now, we just established to train all the newcomer, all the new engineer to be more -- they can grow faster. So externally, we got the help from government. Internally, we do our own part also to enhance the training. And that's the way that we try to meet the requirement of enough talent people inside TSMC. Okay. Thank you, Roland. I think that was... Yes. This actually is one question. That's 2 questions, Roland, okay. Roland, we're happy to have you get back in the queue. Next one for question is Andrew Lu from Sinolink Securities. Yes. My first question is can we know what kind of percentage capacity increase on 8-inch specialty foundry and 12-inch mature -- 12-inch advanced for the next 3 years? Maybe just the average will be fine. Okay. So Andrew's first question is on the capacity increase. He wants to know, in the next 3 years, how much capacity are we increasing on 8-inch and then how much capacity are we increasing on the 12-inch. Andrew, let me share with you, we don't disclose that kind of details. But basically, 80% of the CapEx will be spent in advanced technology, about 10% in advanced packaging and mask making and another 10% in specialty technologies. In the next 3 years. In the next 3 years. Okay. Andrew, do you have a second question? Yes. I do have the second question, but the first question doesn't really answer. So can I have 2 more? No. We do not comment on the capacity by 8-inch or 12-inch, I think, Wendell has just said. Okay. Okay. Then second question is not related to price. Assuming the next year our rebate to the customer has been removed, what kind of percentage -- additional growth we should factor into our model? Okay. So Andrew's second question is assuming next year that the rebates have been removed, how much will this drive additional growth in next year and how should he factor this into his model. Well, it's kind of -- pricing is strictly confidential between TSMC and TSMC's customer. So I don't think that we can comment on that one, whether it's rebate, whether it's any other activities. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next one to ask question, Sunny Lin from UBS. So my first question is also on CapEx. So when you plan for CapEx for this year and next few years, do you think the equipment supply could be a potential bottleneck in terms of the additional upside that you can spend? Well, I think several equipment makers have mentioned that based on this year's industry CapEx, they are already at expanded supply tightness, especially for EUV. So any color would be appreciated. Okay. So Sunny's first question is that with our CapEx plan, do we see or face any equipment bottlenecks in terms of securing the tools and equipment. And I think part of your question is also particularly with regards to EUV. Well, let me answer the question. In fact, when we plan $100 billion CapEx, we also work closely with our supplier and -- to prepare in advance. So we don't expect -- certainly, we don't expect any bottleneck, whether it is EUV or not. And actually, we work closely with them. Got it. Right. So would it be fair to assume that when you announced $100 billion CapEx for next 3 years, it's already -- you already have commitment from your suppliers? The answer is yes. Got it. My second question is 3-nanometer. Now we are just about a year before the mass production in second half of 2022. So at this point, how should we think about the revenue contribution in its first year of commercial production? I think for 5- and 7-nanometer, they could get to high single digit of revenue or even close to 10% in first year. So just want to get your thought on that. Okay. So Sunny's second question is looking at 3-nanometer. And with the schedule for production, how should we think about the revenue contribution from 3-nanometer in its first year? Sunny, that's too far to talk about that. We will update you later on. Now it's about 2 or 3 years away, yes. But we do expect it's big and long-lasting nodes, just like the former N5. Okay. Thank you, Sunny. Right now, we have Laura Chen from KGI. Yes. My first question is still same -- similar to previous question about inventory days and inventory level. I think both Wendell and C.C. mentioned already that high inventory probably will proceed for a while. But in what level we may start to worry about that? Or what would be the checking point? Because so far, we all know that the demand outlook and TSMC's -- and particularly in the advanced node are quite tight. But what would be the checking point we closely follow? That's my first question. Okay. So Laura's first question is with regards to inventory and inventory levels. She understands the demand is tight. But do we worry about the inventory levels? What are the type of checking points that we would look at. Well, let me answer that question. Yes, I did say that our customer want to secure the supply, actually, at this moment. That's due to some imbalance in the supply chain. And they are preparing for the future also.
But how we are going to do to test this, what is the checking point? Actually, let me say that we are working with our customer closely. It's not daily, it's at least we check very often. And we make sure that all the demand to TSMC has been secured, and we prepare the capacity for that. Okay. And my second question is also about the mature node. I think C.C. mentioned about some specialty design, special technology for mature node. I recall you mentioned before about the CIS progress and also the gallium nitride progress. Can you give me more update on some special technology you are working now with the mature node, which may be the expansion in the next few years? Okay. So Laura's second question is looking at the mature nodes and that C.C. mentioned that our strategy is to work with customers to develop specialty technologies at those mature nodes. So she is wondering if we can give little more examples of what types of specialty technologies. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. And also FD-SOI as well, if it's possible. And FD-SOI in other areas. Well, let me answer the last one first. We don't work on the FD-SOI per se. But we develop the specialty technology for CMOS image sensor, as I mentioned previously. And the technology continue to improve because if you look at the application of the CMOS image sensor in the smartphone, in the automotive, there are a lot, okay? And we also -- in fact, the most important one also is ultra-low power that we develop the technology to meet the requirement of the mobile world. I mean that everything is portable. So ultra-low power is very important.
Gallium nitride, all those kind of specialty, we continue to work with our customer, and for the future, high-frequency application or the high-voltage applications. We also work on the RF technology. Radio frequencies is important. Because of 5G's era, the RF become very, very important in application in the WiFi communication area and a lot of them. So following that question, do we have space or any capacity to further expand those technology here in Taiwan? So Laura is asking then will space be a constraint or limitation for the specialty. Good question. We are working with our customer to expand our capacity whenever necessary. Okay. Okay. Right. Thank you, Laura. Next on the line is Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities. Yes. I just got one question here. I think your top -- regarding your second quarter guidance, the revenue is going to grow sequentially in U.S. dollar terms. And also, if I don't remember wrong, Wendell did say that your inventory increase in Q1 was mainly because your customers prebuilt inventory for 5-nanometer. So that assumes that your 5-nanometer contribution will also increase in second quarter.
So -- and also the exchange rate, also not getting worse, right?
So against the backdrop of these 3 positive factors, right, revenue increase, 5-nanometer increase and favorable exchange rate, why your gross margin guidance for the second quarter is below your first quarter? Okay. So Rick's question is looking at the second quarter and looking at the gross margin guidance, why is it basically lower than the first quarter or is sequential declining if you use the midpoint? Okay. Rick, let me explain to you. The sequential decline is mainly due to mix as the contribution from N5 will increase, but it still carries a dilutive effect. And secondly, we see a slower rate of cost improvement as our fabs continue to run at a very high level of utilization, leaving less time to do cost-improvement activities. And lastly, a more technical thing is the absence of a positive inventory revaluation in the quarter. Okay. Thank you, Rick. Next one to ask questions is Aaron Jeng from Nomura Securities. This question was not asked before, so I wish to ask before end of the call. You state customers' engagement on N3 and N5 are stronger than what you saw 3 months ago, which drives your $100 billion CapEx for the next 3 years, okay? So I may ask in this way, compared with 3 months ago, are you now projecting a bigger market share gain potential over the next 3 years as pure foundry market and your widening technology leadership [ as a benchmark ]. This is my only question. Okay, Aaron. So Aaron's question is looking at the fact that we said customer engagement at 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer are stronger than what we saw a few months ago. So does this mean that we're going to -- expect to gain bigger or larger market share as a result. Is that correct, Aaron? Yes. And a bigger market share than expected 3 months ago. Versus 3 months ago. Okay. Let me answer that question. Certainly, as compared with 3 months ago, we have some progress in engaging with the customer to get their commitment to work with TSMC on 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. And whether this one is the indication of TSMC's technology leadership, I would happily to say yes. We are continuing -- but the most important thing actually is that we are continuing to work with customer to develop the technology they need for their product. Each customer has a different kind of preference and we always can meet their demand. Okay. Thank you, Aaron. Next one to ask question, Mehdi Hosseini, SIG. Yes. My first question has to do with some of the comparisons that you provided during last earnings conference call. You were comparing the capital intensity and growth prospect to the period of 2010 and 2015. In that context, my question has to do with depreciation. Back then during the period of 2010 through 2015, depreciation increased at a growth rate of 20%. How do you see that growth rate changing in the period of 2020 and 2025? And I have a follow-up. Okay. So Mehdi's first question is looking at, I think, basically, looking at depreciation and looking at as we enter a higher period of growth, what does our depreciation look like. And also, he is asking about the depreciation growth or increase. Given that we expect to grow between 10% to 15% in 2020 to '25 CAGR period, what does the depreciation growth look like this year and then beyond? Okay. I can share with you that the depreciation this year will be around 30% higher than last year. And we are not ready to share with you the rest of the 5-year period depreciation at this moment. Okay. Do you have a second question, Mehdi? Okay. Sure. Yes, I have a second question. You raised your CapEx spending, given the increased demand by your customer. But your revenue growth target remains the same at 10% to 15%. Why aren't you raising the revenue target as you're raising the CapEx? Okay. So I think Mehdi is asking that we raised the CapEx spending. And so why -- what is our view of the growth target, 10% to 15%? Why are we not raising that as well? Mehdi, actually, if you think about this 10% to 15% 5-year CAGR, it's a pretty big range. From what we currently forecast, the revenue target is still within that range, maybe higher to the -- closer to the higher end than last time. Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. Thank you. Now we have Randy Abrams from Crédit Suisse. Okay. Yes. The first one on the back end, that's keeping pace. Could you give an update on the spending and momentum you're seeing for the new SoIC and then also how the CoWoS and InFO are progressing? Okay. So Randy's first question is on our advanced packaging solutions. He wants to know -- want an update on how SoIC is progressing as well as CoWoS and the other solutions. Is that right, Randy? Yes. That's correct. Okay. Okay. Let me comment on the SoIC first. This is the most advanced back-end technology, I think, that we offer to our customer. And it will start to small volume production in 2022. And it's also actually adopted by a very high-performance HPC applications.
As for InFO and CoWoS, we continue to expand our customer portfolio. And I expect that the business from InFO and CoWoS will start to -- will continue to increase in the next several years. Okay. Great. And just I have one quick one on that. You mentioned very high-performance applications. SoIC, in a couple of years, as it ramps, should that be a big -- like also, do you expect a pretty big ramp like we saw in the past for InFO or it should be a good volume runner for TSMC?
And then I wanted to ask a second question. Just a couple of clarification on gross margin in second half. Five will be getting more mature. So I'm curious, factoring your depreciation guidance, 5 getting more mature, if your view is 50% gross margin or if you're running very tight utilization, we may be able to stay a bit above the long-term range in the second half. Okay. So a quick one. He -- Randy wants to know SoIC, will it be a large contributor? How large can it be in a few years' time? And then also on gross margin, the gross margin outlook for second half. We hope that SoIC going to be adopted by all those HPC applications customer. But I cannot nail down that what is the specific revenue number in the future. But we do expect our back-end service will continue to grow. And the rate -- the growth rate will be a little bit higher than the corporate average. Okay. Randy, about second half gross margin, it's a bit too early to give details on that. However, you've already mentioned several things. N5 will become bigger in contribution to the revenue. It still has -- carries a negative or dilutive effect on the margins, about 2 to 3 percentage points. Utilization is pretty -- still pretty tight. And we continue trying to improve our cost under this very high-utilization environment. So that's all the things we can share with you at this moment. Okay. And if I can fit in... Sorry, Randy. I'm sorry, that's 2 questions because we're -- yes, thank you. Okay. The next one will be Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. My first question is how should we think about HPC in terms of the demand cadence for second and third wave? I think when smartphone was our big growth driver in the last 10 years, we had leading-edge growth from processors, et cetera, but we also had a lot of other ICs in smartphones as well as our applications, which drove the second, third, fourth wave of demand for any process node.
So now that HPC seems to be one of the key drivers for growth, how do we think about second-, third-wave demand? Would it keep up with the first and second wave for N5, N3, et cetera? Or should we think about TSMC will be doing more capacity conversion compared to in the past? That's my first question. Okay. So Gokul's first question is looking at HPC and looking at how HPC is also, along with smartphone, becoming the first-wave adopters of our leading-edge nodes. He's wondering then, though, for the second and additional waves of demand, will HPC -- how do we see HPC driving additional waves of demand or will we convert capacity. Let me make some comment. Actually, the HPC application includes many different subsegment such as CPU, GPU, networking, FPGA, AI-accelerated video gaming, et cetera, et cetera. And each one will have their own migration path and product life cycle also. So we expect to see HPC not only in the first wave, but in additional waves of demand to support our leading node in the future, actually. Did that answer your questions? Okay. That's clear. Do you have a second question? Second question, just wanted to -- yes. Just wanted to follow up on any thoughts from TSMC on the Arizona fab capacity. I think you've already announced 20,000 of wafers per month of 5-nanometer coming up in 2024. What has been your discussion with customers regarding any potential upside to this capacity? Are customers asking for more capacity there? Do you feel that we -- right now, this seems more like an n-1 cadence because 5-nano started in Taiwan in 2020 already. Do we feel that we will move to a more shorter or a quicker cadence for leading edge in, let's say, Arizona or U.S. capacity? I just wanted to understand how TSMC is thinking about this right now. Okay. Gokul's second question is on our U.S. manufacturing and our fab in Arizona. He wants to know that our customer is asking for more capacity or more production. And also, we start with N5, I guess your question is what about the future plans for bringing additional technologies there and the cadence. Okay. We are executing our plan in Arizona according to the schedule, and construction will start this year. Phase 1 production, as you said, we are starting 2024 with 20,000 wafer per month 5-nanometer technology. But in fact, we have acquired a large piece of land in Arizona to provide flexibility. So further expansion is possible, but we will ramp up to Phase 1 first, then based on the operation efficiency and cost economics and also the customers' demand to decide what the next steps we are going to do.
Our customer welcome us to build capacity in the U.S., and our fab in Arizona will be available to support all our customers from around the world and just like other -- all the TSMC's fab, no matter where they are and no matter where they're located. Okay. Thank you. Yes. The last one to ask question, Sebastian Hou, CLSA. Yes. I only have one question. So just a follow-up on C.C.'s comments earlier, that C.C. mentioned that TSMC has been working closely with customer to analyze the gap between capacity and demand on the trailing-edge nodes.
So I'm wondering if you could share some color with us. If we exclude the overbooking portion and based on your best analysis, does the demand still significantly exceed supply? And how big is the gap, if you have any rough number that can be shared?
Furthermore, based on the CapEx you and your peers are investing in the capacity expansion lead time, when do you think the tightness can be eased or the whole shortage situation can be removed? That's the only question I have. Okay. Let me try to summarize your question, Sebastian. You're asking, on the mature nodes, the fact that TSMC works with our customers very closely, but also in looking at the supply/demand of those older nodes. So with the additional capacity added, will -- when and will we eventually see an easing of the supply tightness at the mature nodes? Is that correct, Sebastian? Yes. And also, if you can, if we exclude the overbooking part, with your best estimate, whether the demand is still exceeding supply right now. All right. To be frank with you, as I said, we work with customer closely. And so the overbooking is not in our calculation, although we did not exclude it out of this possibility. But we do the very detailed analysis internally, and as I said, work with customer closely. And so we prepare the mature node capacity for them.
However, building a fab from a green fab start and also to install the capacity, it won't be available until 2023. And so this year and next year, I still expect the capacity tightening will continue and probably also next year. 2023, I hope that we can offer more capacity to support our customers. And at that time, we start to see the supply chains tightening will release a little bit. Okay. Sebastian, does that answer your question? Yes. So is it fair for us to conclude that in the next 18 months, it is very safe to assume that we will still be in the supply tight situation, is that right? For our customers, we are working with them, let me say that. But it's still very tight. Yes, you are right. Okay. Thank you, Sebastian. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 4 hours from now and the transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which are going to be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay healthy and safe, and we hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a good day.","TSMC's earnings conference call will be live via live audio webcast . the format for today's event will be as follows . tsmc's vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2021 .",0.0

The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2021, followed by our guidance for the third quarter 2021. Afterwards, TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei; Mr. Huang; and TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A. 
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release. 
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter revenue increased 2.7% sequentially in NT dollar terms or 2.9% in U.S. dollar term. Our second quarter business was supported by continued strength in HPC and automotive-related demand.
Gross margin decreased 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 50% mainly due to N5 dilution, the slower rate of cost improvement and the absence of positive inventory revaluation.
Total operating expenses slightly increased TWD 1.47 billion. Therefore, operating margins decreased 2.4 percentage points sequentially to 39.1%.
Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 5.18 and ROE was 27.3%. 
Let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 18% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 31%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 49% of wafer revenue. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 12% to account for 39%. IoT decreased 2% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 12% to account for 4%. And DCE decreased 12% to account for 4%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 871 billion.
On the liability side, current liabilities decreased TWD 14 billion mainly due to the decrease of TWD 23 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the increase of TWD 6 billion in dividend payable. 
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 134 billion mainly as we raised TWD 137 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. 
On financial ratios. Accounts receivables turnover days increased 2 days to 42 days, while days of inventory also rose 2 days to 85 days primarily due to N5 wafer prebuild. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 187 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 167 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for third quarter of 2020 cash dividend.  Short-term loans increased TWD 4 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 137 billion. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 83 billion to TWD 748 billion at the end of the quarter. 
In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled USD 5.97 billion. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our third quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 14.6 billion and USD 14.9 billion, which represents an 11% sequential increase at the midpoint.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.9, gross margin is expected to be between 49.5% and 51.5%, operating margin between 38.5% and 40.5%. 
This concludes my financial presentation. I will turn the microphone over to our CEO, C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with TSMC's long-term growth outlook and investment plan. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand as the multiyear megatrend of 5G- and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel massive increase in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, which will require leading-edge technologies. 
COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's lives. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well positioned to capture the structural growth from the favorable industry megatrend with our differentiated technologies.
We now expect our long-term revenue CAGR from 2020 to 2025 to be near the high end of our 10% to 15% CAGR range in U.S. dollar terms. 
In the near term, we continue to observe both short-term imbalances in the supply chain driven by the need to ensure supply security, as well as a structural increase in long-term demand. While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout the year and into 2022 fueled by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and special technologies. 
For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market excluding memory to grow about 17% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 20%. 
We now expect -- for TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow above 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms. 
To address the structural increase in long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working with closely our customer to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their demand. Our capital investment decision are based on 4 disciplines, that is: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return.
To ensure a proper return from the investment, both pricing and costs are important. TSMC's pricing strategy is strategic, not opportunistic. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint and rising materials and basic commodities cost.
Therefore, we are firming up our wafer pricing. We will continue to work closely with our customers to provide our value. We will also continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe we can continue to earn proper returns that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
Next, let me talk about automotive supply update. TSMC has actively taken steps throughout the first half of this year, and we will continue to do so in the second half to address the chip supply challenges for our automotive customers. The automotive supply chain is known and complex with its own inventory management practices. 
From chip production to car production, it takes at least 6 months to reach the automotive OEMs with several tiers of suppliers in between. However, we have worked dynamically with other customers to reallocate our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry. In first half of this year, we successfully increased our output for MCUs, one of the key components in automotive semiconductor products, by about 30% as compared to first half 2020. For the full year, we expect to increase output for MCUs by close to 60% over the 2020 level which also represents about a 30% increase over the 2018 prepandemic level. 
By taking such actions, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC customers starting this quarter. 
Now let me talk about the N5 and N4 progress. TSMC's N5 is the foundry industry's most advanced solution with the best PPA. N5 is already in its second year of volume production with yields well on track. N5 demand continued to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021. 
To further enhance our 5-nanometer family's performance, power and density improvements for the next wave 5-nanometer products, we introduced N4 technology, which is a straightforward migration from N5 with comparable design rules. N4 risk production will begin this quarter and volume production in 2022. Thus, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications. 
Finally, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full scaling from our N5 and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We have developed a complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone application of N3. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tapeouts for N3 for the first year as compared with N5.
Risk production is scheduled in 2021, and production will start in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. 
With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that both N5 and N3 will be large and long-lasting nodes for TSMC and become an important driver of our long-term growth. 
Now let me turn over the microphone to Wendell. Thank you, C.C. Let me start by making some comments on our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of TWD 372.1 billion or USD 13.3 billion, slightly above our guidance mainly due to better demand from HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago. 
Moving into third quarter 2021. We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies driven by all 4 growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications. 
On the inventory side, we expect our fabless customers' overall inventory to exit second quarter of '21 at a healthy level. We expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare higher levels of inventory in the second half of the year as compared to the historical seasonal level, given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security following supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions. 
Next, let me talk about our profitability. Our second quarter gross margin of 50% was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Our gross margin guidance provided 3 months ago was based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.4, whereas the actual second quarter exchange rate was USD 1 to TWD 28.01. This created about 0.5 percentage point difference in our actual second quarter gross margin versus our original guidance. 
In other words, if the exchange rate had maintained at $1 to TWD 28.4, our second quarter gross margin would have been 50.5%. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.9, we have just guided third quarter 2021 gross margin to increase by 0.5 percentage point sequentially to 50.5% at the midpoint, mainly due to better back-end profitability. 
Despite the rapidly rising depreciation costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rate, we are able to maintain our gross margin at above 50% in both second quarter and third quarter. Although a higher level of capital intensity is necessary in the near term as we are accelerating our investment pace in anticipation of the strong growth that will follow, we expect to continue to earn a similar level of long-term return. 
Our long-term financial objectives remain unchanged. We reiterate the long-term gross margin of above 50% is achievable with operating margin to be above 39% and ROE to be above 20% through the cycle. 
Now let me make some comments on our cash dividend distribution policy. TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. In June, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the distribution of a TWD 2.75 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2021, which will be distributed in October 2021. Therefore, TSMC shareholders will receive a total of TWD 10.25 cash dividend per share in 2021. That also means shareholders will receive at least TWD 11 per share cash dividend for 2022 and the quarterly cash dividend is expected to be at least TWD 2.75 per share. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to our Chairman, Mark. Thank you. Thank you, Wendell, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will talk about TSMC's global manufacturing footprint. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. TSMC always treat our customers as partners. We do not compete with our customers. We grow our business by unleashing our customers' innovations and enabling their success. We earn our business by providing solid values, by providing industry-leading technologies, the world's largest logic capacity and efficient and cost-effective manufacturing to our customers, while maintaining trusting relationship with them. 
In our capital investment, our responsibility as TSMC management is to make the best decision in the interest of the company and our customers. And our fiduciary duty is to our shareholders. 
As the need for semiconductor infrastructure security has increased in recent years, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint to sustain and enhance our competitive advantages and to better serve our customers in the new geopolitical environment. 
In Taiwan, we are building capacity for N5 and N3 in Tainan Science Park. Due to the strong customer demand, we have further expand -- plan to expand in Northern, Central and Southern Science Parks in Taiwan. And Taiwan will continue to be the home base and center of R&D for TSMC. As the initial phase of volume production of a leading-edge technology has to be in close proximity and closely coupled with R&D fab due to massive collaborative engineering activities, our leading node will continue to be ramped in Taiwan as well. 
In the U.S., we are increasing our presence with an advanced 12-inch semiconductor fab in Arizona and the progress is well on track with our plan. We are actively in a fast learning phase to optimize the operating efficiency for the U.S. fab. 
The first wave of U.S.-hired engineers arrived Taiwan in late April for training on 5-nanometer technology. Construction of the fab has already begun with equipment moving in scheduled for second half 2022. Phase 1 volume production of 20,000 wafer per month of 5-nanometer technology will begin in first quarter '24. At that time, our 5-nanometer family will still be the most advanced high-volume production technology commercially available in the U.S. 
Our customers welcome us to build capacity in the U.S. and pledged their strong support and business commitments. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility of a second phase of expansion to meet our customers' strong demand. 
In China, as our fab construction in Nanjing has already completed in 2017, we have completed the Phase 1 volume ramp in third quarter 2020, now reaching 25,000 wafer per month capacity of 16-nanometer technology. We are further expanding our presence in Nanjing with 28-nanometer technology to support our customers' urgent needs with volume production beginning in second half 2022 and reaching 40,000 wafer per month capacity by mid-2023.
For the long term, we forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and our structural demand for 28-nanometer will be strongly supported by multiple specialty technologies. 
Our global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customer needs, business opportunities, operating efficiencies and cost economic considerations. While overseas fab are not initially able to match the cost of our manufacturing operations in Taiwan, we will work with governments to minimize the cost gap to ensure we start with a level playing field. We are working closely with our customers to firm up our wafer pricing to reflect the cost increases and ensure we earn a proper return. We will work diligently on enhancing our operations and service capabilities and optimize our efficiencies in overseas locations to continue to provide technology leadership with efficient and cost-effective manufacturing for our customers. 
By taking such steps, we believe an expansion of our global manufacturing footprint will enable us to reach global talent, better serve our customers' needs, earn the proper return from our investment and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Chairman. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Now let us begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? Yes. The first caller, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Maybe my first question I would focus on the semiconductor supply and demand. C.C., you mentioned that you're expecting demand to still remain extremely strong, supply to remain tight through end of this year potentially through next year as well.
Could you talk about when do you expect supply and demand to come back into balance? Do you see a situation where your customers go into a bit of an inventory correction mode sometime soon? Or you think that the structurally higher inventory is something that is likely to last for a much longer period of time than what originally the market thought? Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your first question. Gokul's first question is on the semiconductor supply-and-demand outlook. He notes that C.C. has said our capacity will be tight throughout this year and into 2020 (sic) [ 2022 ].
All right. So let me summarize Gokul's question again on semiconductor supply and demand. He's wondering or asking, when do we see supply and demand in the semiconductor coming back into the balance? Is there a risk of an inventory correction anytime soon? And how long can a higher level of inventory continue? Well, Gokul, let me answer your question. Let's -- let me share with you our perspective on the shortage right now. The current semiconductor capacity shortage is being driven by both a structural increase in long-term market demand and also a short-term imbalance in the supply chain due to uncertainties from COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions. And that may or may not persist. 
We do not rule out the possibility of an inventory correction in the future, but we expect our capacity will remain tight throughout this year and extend at least into 2022. But let me share with you also that even inventory correction to occur, we believe it will be less volatile than previous downturn as our underlying structural megatrend of 5G-related and HPC application will continue. Do I answer your question? Gokul, does that address your first question? And do you have a second question, if so?
All right. Operator, I think we have lost Gokul. Maybe we'll move on to the next caller first. Yes. The next one is Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. I wanted to ask the question on the trend per cost purchase. I'm curious for 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer, how you're seeing continued improvement?
And for the customer motivation to migrate, how is that shifting between how our power performance density and cost versus also increasingly seek out the back-end system level integration? Okay. Randy, let me summarize your first question. Your first question is on the cost per transistor. Randy wants to know what is the cost per transistor trend at 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer. And also what do -- I guess, Randy, your question is sort of what are the customers value -- or evaluate when they look at the technologies as well. Is that correct? Yes, right, between power performance density versus cost and also back-end integration. Okay. Randy. No, actually, today, the technology has getting more complex than the simple scaling. Actually, we work with our customers very closely and we have been working on the performance and energy efficiency of a technology. And we took several approach, of course, material innovation, transistor structure innovation. We also, in recent generations, we work heavily on the design and technology cooperation. And also more recently, we work on the 3D ICs. 
All these innovation combined is to deliver the value for our customer to improve the system performance and the system's power efficiency. And TSMC is at the forefront of delivering this value and as evidenced by the strong demand and continued technology migration at 5 to 3. So in doing that, we believe we can continue earn a proper return for our investment. Thank you, Randy. Okay. My second question, if you could give an update on the 5-nanometer where there's still some dilution. Maybe how much dilution you see in the second half? And update on how you see it trending towards the corporate gross margin.
And as we look to next year, if 3-nanometer ramping late in the year, could we see a favorable like a bit more of a sweet spot for profitability as you have a more mature 5-nanometer, but not a new node yet ramping? Okay. Randy, this is Wendell. Let me answer your question. The 5-nanometer contribution to our revenue will be much higher this year compared to last year. Therefore, we expect that the margin dilution from N5 this year will be between 2 to 3 percentage points. 
Now we also expect that N5, like previous nodes, will be able to reach -- the margin will reach the corporate average in about 7 to 8 quarters.
With respect to 2022, it's a bit too early to talk about it. But we believe our long-term gross margin target of 50% continues to be achievable. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Yes. And the next one is Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I think a lot of your customers have like different supply chain management policies. A lot of your customers find a long-term contract with other flagship players with favorable pricing and payment terms. So does TSMC expect this will become the new norm for the foundry industry? Does the industry-wide profit pool become bigger and the earnings fluctuation will be less in the future? Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Let me summarize your first question. Bruce's first question is about the semiconductor supply chain, and he's observed that a lot of customers seem to be signing long-term contracts with foundries. So do we expect this to be the new norm in the future? And could this drive a bigger or larger industry-wide profit pool? Okay. Bruce, let me answer the question. We are not able to comment on specific business terms with customers. However, we are working closely with our customers on different ways to secure their commitment. And customers understand our effort to support their growth. And if we plan our capacity well based on the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile, we believe our utilization and profitability can be maintained. Okay. Thank you. Bruce, do you have a second question? Sure. So I want to focus on the automotive like automotive revenue is roughly less than $2 billion in 2020 out of a $40 billion market. So with most of the automotive IDM companies are passive in capacity expansion, this creates a big addressable market for the foundry. So what is the addressable market for foundry in the automotive semi industry in the coming years? Okay. Bruce, let me summarize your second question. So Bruce is asking about the longer-term outlook for the automotive industry. Automotive was less than $2 billion of our revenue last year, but he points out the automotive TAM is about $40 billion. So he's wondering about sort of the long-term TAM addressable market for TSMC. Well, let me answer again. We are quite positive on the long-term trend of the semiconductors in -- semiconductor content in automotive as the trend towards safer, greener and smarter vehicles will continue to drive silicon content increase as well as the demand for advanced and specialty technology, both. Okay. Thank you. Does that answer your question, Bruce? Can we have somehow like some specific numbers? Can you quantify that a little bit? We cannot forecast in the future very accurately, right? I mean that is so dynamic. But let me assure you that silicon content will be very important and will be increased. Thank you, Bruce. The next one is a question from Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Yes, let me ask my second question. My second question is that on your 3-nanometer business, clearly the market is expecting you to make a lot more inroads into the HPC segment. One of your existing IDM customers have redoubled their efforts to get back into the foundry business. Could you talk a little bit about how you manage this kind of what they call as coopetition, competition as well as cooperation? How does TSMC think about this when it thinks about capacity allocation, given that HPC is now becoming a very important driver for growth and this is probably the biggest HPC customer out there in terms of revenue size? Okay. Gokul, thank you for your second question. Let me summarize. He points out that HPC is -- seems to become a larger and larger contributor or driver, particularly at our 3-nanometer. He also points out that existing IDM customers are redoubling their efforts. So his question is really how -- I guess, how do we manage this duality? How do we manage the capacity allocation and the relationship? Okay. Let me answer the question by, first, you mentioned that IDM is our important customer. Let me say that. And we are collaborating in some area and might competing in other areas. But let me explain again, TSMC is everybody's foundry and we support all our customers openly and fairly. We will allocate the necessary engineering resources to ensure all of our customers' product success, both existing customer and for the future customer. 
How to plan our capacity to support? Actually our capacity planning is based on the long-term market demand and thus is underpinned by the industry megatrend, okay? Does that answer your question, Gokul? So maybe just one follow-up. Do you require a lot more assurance in terms of demand, solidity and demand longevity from IDM customers given they are also competing on process technology with you compared to pure fabless? So Gokul is asking whether that we would require more longer-term assurance from our IDM customers versus our fabless customers. We will not specifically comment on that and a certain customer, okay? Okay. Thank you, Gokul, and sorry for the disruption. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. First of all, I would like to thank TSMC for the donation of the vaccine to Taiwan. I think that ensures business continuity of TSMC and also global semi supply chain. 
And my question is about still your gross margin trend. So first of all, is your 3D IC or advanced packaging. It seems like Wendell mentioned that the back end product possibilities are getting better in 3Q, I'm not sure if that's true. So the question is that currently the percentage of advanced packaging of TSMC's revenue.
And would the company still believe 3D packaging can still outgrow the wafer business and whether they would create a margin dilution. So the first question is about the 3D advanced packaging. Okay. Let me summarize your question, Charlie. You're asking about our 3D IC business. Charlie is asking the back-end profitability that Wendell cited improvement in the third quarter. Is this the truth?
And then also sort of the outlook for our 3D IC business in comparison to our overall business. And whether 3D IC business will dilute our profitability. Okay, Charlie. First of all, the gross margin that I was talking about, improvement of back-end service in the third quarter actually is a seasonal factor. As you know, our back-end services has seasonality. So second half normally has a higher gross margin. But longer term, we expect its margin to continue to improve although it's still not as high as a gross margin of our wafer revenue. But it has a lower asset capital intensity, therefore, the returns from back-end services is satisfactory. 
In terms of a revenue percentage, we expect back-end services to account for about 8% of our total revenue this year. And in the next 5 years, we expect it will grow slightly higher than the corporate average. Okay. Thank you, Wendell. Do you have a second question, Charlie? Yes, I do. Yes, my next question is about the long-term gross margin trend, right? Because we did create something better about the thrust -- or the higher CapEx intensity, your bargaining power against different vendors and those customers. So really, I want to ask this openly to company management. Does TSMC believe you has acquired the monopoly of the leading edge in the industry, why and why not?
And if yes, do you think you have the monopoly, why can not TSMC charge higher wafer price to cover the increase of CapEx intensity?
And lastly, if the company were to -- need to choose between the margin sustainability and also the market share, what would be your choice? Okay. Let me summarize your second question, Charlie. So Charlie is asking about the long-term gross margin trend and bargaining power. And he is wondering -- he wants to know whether we see or believe we have a monopoly at the leading edge or not. And if we do, I guess, part of your question, Charlie, is then how -- pricing. And then also, if we have to choose between market share and profitability, how should we choose? Charlie, let me answer this question. First, we do have a very high market share on the leading-edge technology node. But our pricing strategy is strategic, and we don't take an optimistic approach.
And it's far away from you say that we try to bargaining power. In fact, we work with our customers closely and we want to help them to be successful while we get a proper return. That's all I can answer for you for our pricing.
And looking ahead, we continue our practice, try our best to hear our customers, to grow and we want to get the proper return. So that's why we are firming up our wafer pricing. And we are confident that we can get our gross margin about 50% or above in the long term. Okay. Thank you. All right. The next one to ask a question, Nicolas Gaudois from UBS. Earlier, you referred to your expansion of capacity at 28-nanometer in Nanjing for about 16,000 -- 15,000 since the launch. If the demand in trailing edge is effectively structurally higher and tying up to the leading edge, are we going to see additions in capacity in the trailing edge becoming more of a recurring feature for TSMC as for the rest of the industry going forward? Okay, Nick, let me try to summarize your first question. So Nick is saying that, as Chairman said, we are expanding our capacity in Nanjing for 28-nanometer. So his question is that do we see the demand at the trailing edge or the mature nodes becoming structurally higher? And then will we consider or add capacity in those trailing edge nodes? Okay. This is Mark. Let me answer your question. Our strategy more recently in mature node is to work closely with our customer to develop specialty technology solution. This is not described by the numbers. Actually, we are leading in many 28-nanometer specialty technologies and we can meet their requirement and create differentiated long-term value for them.
And we expect this structural demand will continue. And of course, we'll focus on our investment on specialty technology to support that. So for the manufacturing greenfield, no expansion. And we do not rule it out, we will build case by case as long as the economics can justify and customer commitment can be secured. Okay. Thank you. Nick, do you have a second question? Yes. Very quickly. Thank you, Jeff. A clarification effectively for the investment in the U.S., you say the equipment moving in, in H2 '22 and then production in Q1 '24. A reasonably long runway, I guess. So is that because new fab you need to obviously run preproduction, that qualification time will be reasonably low? Yes. We make -- prepared a little bit longer preparation time just because that's a new semiconductor environment for our operations. But of course, we will continue to compress the schedule as much as we can, yes. Okay. Thank you, Nick. The next one to ask question, Roland Shu from Citigroup. My first question is for your Japan R&D center. So it is stated more than 20 Japanese companies will work with you at your 3D IC R&D center in Japan. So I want to know what are the roles and responsibility for every party including yourself in this Japan R&D center?
And also, do you plan to start 3D IC packaging mass production in Japan one day? And do you plan to build a wafer fab in Japan for foundry business going forward? Okay. Roland's first question. He wants to know about our 3D IC research center in Japan. There's more than 20 companies involved according to him. So what are the roles and responsibilities of that?
And also, will we build a packaging -- 3D IC packaging integration facility in Japan. And will we consider a wafer fab in Japan. So 3 parts to this question. Okay. Roland, let me answer your question. First, yes, there is more than 20 membership to join this Japan's 3D ICs research center. In fact, what's the role and responsibility, TSMC is in charge of this one. And we also -- in technology, we're also in charge of the integration for all the major partner together, too, so that we can be successful in the most advanced packaging technology, which includes TSMC's 3D IC and some of our partner's advanced material and our partner's most advanced substrate technology. Everything put together, which is necessary for the future HPC's application that we needed.
Do we have a plan to mass production in the 3D IC in Japan? It's not in our current planning yet, okay? And what's your next question? And will we consider... How about the wafer fab, yes. The wafer fab, we are -- actually, let me say that we are -- we do not rule out any possibility. And in Japan, we are in due diligence process now to expect to do that wafer fab, let me say that, clearly. Okay. My second question is Mark also said that the key concern to build a fab overseas is considering the cost gap, and you are working with the governments to close the cost gap. However, recently there were some noises in the U.S. to request the U.S. government to invest wisely in domestic companies to support U.S. authority. So it changed U.S. government's plan and lead to fail to close the cost gap to TSMC in U.S. operations. And how are you going to close the cost gap if there is no adequate support from the U.S. government, okay? Okay. Let me summarize Roland's second question, it's about our U.S. fab and the cost gap. He points out that recently there is some discussion for U.S. incentives to invest in domestic companies. And so therefore, if this were to be the case, how would that affect TSMC and how would we manage the cost gap? Okay. Roland, right? This is -- I think this current event is still developing. You know that in U.S., the originally proposed CHIPS for America Act has gained bipartisan support. And we are very happy that in the Senate they passed a bill of U.S. Innovation and Competitive Act already passed in Senate. Right now it's in the hands of the House of Representatives, and we are very optimistic that they will gain bipartisan support.
The reason we -- the bipartisan support for this is to create a level playing field for the semiconductor fab investment in U.S. so that there will be a renewal fab industry in the U.S. Of course, how well it can be done in operation up to each company to do the operating well. And we are still learning the cost structure in the U.S. But in the meantime, in addition to take on this level playing field opportunities and further on, the operating cost will have to be shared with our customers. So that's a part of our firm up price -- firming up pricing, including the increased global manufacturing footprint. So we believe then... So pricing from the other companies? Yes. Yes. We believe in that way, we can continue to sustain our profitability as before. Okay. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Roland. Next one, we have Laura Chen from KGI. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you, Laura. First of all, I just want to ask about our global expansion plan. Can you give us more details about our expansion plan other than like the advanced node in the U.S.? Mark just mentioned that the 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot. So will we expand more other than China or other regions, would we consider that? And how would that impact our already announced USD 100 billion CapEx for the next 3 years? That's my first question. Okay, Laura, let me summarize your question. Your question is about our global manufacturing footprint. And I think your question is on our mature node. Do we have plans for further expansion of mature nodes in different locations? And if so, how will this affect our CapEx in the next few years? Yes. Yes. Laura, I think several project is still under planning. We do not rule out the possibility in Japan. Actually, C.C. just mentioned that we are in the due diligence process now to have a specialty technology fab in Japan. But of course, the decision is still too early to disclose because the final decision will be based on our customer needs, operating efficiency, evaluation and cost economics. So for those projects, we have not included into the $100 billion CapEx budget. Okay? Okay, very clear. Yes. And my second question is about the 16- and 12-nanometer. We know that the current supply is also quite tight and the client demand is very strong, particularly for the RF transceiver, et cetera. So I'm just wondering, do we also have the plan to expand on 16 and 12? Okay. And so Laura's second question continues to more specifically on 16-nanometer/12-nanometer. The supply continues to be tight, demand is very strong. Do we have any plans to expand at this node? Well, Laura, let me answer this question. We -- again, this is the kind of mature node for TSMC. And we will expand our capacity with the customer's commitment. And also, we have to consider the economics. And so if everything is positive, in fact, we will consider to expand the capacity to support our customer actually. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Next one, we have Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I had a question on gross margins. I guess you've talked about 50% gross margin as a long-term target for quite some time now. And I understand there's been FX headwinds and the 5-nanometer ramp as a headwind. If I look at your big fabless customers, they are delivering structurally much higher gross margins as a result of accessing your leading-edge capacity, particularly in the last 12 months when your gross margins are going down. And I'd just like to ask, given your position in the industry, do you really think 50% is an appropriate level of return. And doesn't your position warrant some structural margin expansion at the gross margin level? Okay. Brett's first question is about our gross margin. He notes that, of course, we have been facing headwinds from the foreign exchange rate and also the 5-nanometer ramp, which carries some level of dilution. But he points out that our customers' gross margin is, particularly in the last 12 months, has been structurally higher than ours. So he wants to know, given our position, do we think 50% is achievable? Why would it not be something structurally higher? Is that correct, Brett? Yes. Really whether 50% is an appropriate level of return. Given everyone else is right -- is seeing -- delivering higher gross margins, why wouldn't TSMC look for structurally higher gross margins as well like everyone else? Right. This is Wendell. Let me answer your question. First, if we look at shorter term, you talked about in the last 12 months. Foreign exchange does play a very big role in the gross margin between last year and this year, year-to-date.
Last year, the dollar against NT rate was $29.43 in average. This year, year-to-date, is 28% -- somewhere around 28%. That creates a 2 percentage point difference in gross margin, i.e., if the gross margin -- I mean, if foreign exchange rate stays where it was last year, we would be having a 52% gross margin in the second quarter already. And also, I talked about the dilution from the N5 this year, another 2 to 3 points. So with all these negatives, we still can make 50% in second quarter and the third quarter. That's the short term.
Now longer term, the investment that we are making is for future business growth. At some point of time, at the beginning, we made -- the short-term advanced technology is getting more and more challenging in cost. Then we are working closely with our customers to firm up the wafer pricing and also working with our suppliers to ensure that the cost improvement can be delivered. And with all these efforts, we still think that 50% is a good target and is achievable. Okay. Thank you, Wendell. And maybe just a follow-up. I noticed your China business grew from 6% of sales in Q2 -- sorry, 6% of sales in Q1 to 11% of sales in Q2. Can you talk about some of the drivers that delivered that upside?
And long term, how do we think about China scaling within your business? Do you think we'll get back to sustainably double-digit percent of sales? And what would drive that? Okay. So Brett's second question is related to our China business. He notes in the near term that China contribution has gone from 6% in the first quarter to 11%. So he wants to know what is driving this.
And then he asked a longer-term question, which is how should we think about our China business over the next few years? And can it return or sustain at an improving or double-digit level? Well, Brett, let me summarize it. I think China remains a very strong and growing market. And we have developed a large customer base in China and we'll work with them to grow our business and expect our business from China will continue to increase in all the market sector that we're talking about, smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive also. And also, Brett's question on the improvement from China from 6% in first quarter to 11% in the second quarter. What is driving that? That's because mainly the HPC platform. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Next one, we have Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Can you guys hear me? Yes, we can hear you fine, Charles. So I want to ask the first question really is about your -- the adoption of your most leading-edge node process. Historically, if I understand correctly, your smartphone platform seems to lead the adoption in the past, at least especially in the first year of the production ramp. And I think you did say that the high-performance computing will be coming increasingly important.
So the question really is about 3-nanometer, which we are about a year away from the mass production. So could high-performance computing, from what you see today, really play a bigger role or even like the leading role in the first ramp of the 3-nanometer especially in the first year? Do you even see like high-performance computing could eventually be like the actual lead adopter of the leading-edge nodes going forward? Okay. So Charles' first question is about the drivers of leading node adoption. He notes in the past traditionally it's mainly come from smartphones, but HPC also seems to becoming more important. So his question is on N3, do we expect HPC to play a bigger role in the ramp of N3, particularly in the first year? And could N3 become the first adopter or primary adopter? Charles, This is C.C. Wei. Let me answer this one. The N3's first year is ramping up, still smartphone plays the biggest role. Of course, your observation is correct. HPC application is also important and getting more and more important. And in fact, HPC will be our largest revenue driver in the next 5 years. So in the N3 node, in addition to the smartphones, we do expect the HPC's application will become important also. Did that answer your question? Yes, yes. Excellent. So maybe the second question, I still want to touch upon your global expansion. I know you probably are tired of answering that already, but forgive me, I'm going to ask another one.
You announced your fab in Arizona, which the technology node will be 5-nanometer. And as I understand, 5-nanometer wafers will very likely require your in-house advanced packaging solutions like either InFo, CoWoS or maybe even SoIC going forward. So -- but your current packaging facilities, as I know, are 100% in Taiwan. And I can imagine that if you are really out putting wafers in Arizona for 5-nanometer, based on your current footprint, you got to ship those back to Taiwan for packaging then send back to your customers, which I can imagine it could be a little bit challenging in terms of cost, logistical efficiency.
So I'm not going to ask for a specific plan, but do you kind of foresee maybe you want to set up an advanced packaging facility in Arizona in the near future? Right. So Charles, I'll shorten your second question. I think Charles is asking in Arizona we are building wafer capacity with 5-nanometer. Will we also consider setting up 3D IC integration capacity or -- in Arizona as well? This is Mark, Charles. I understand your concern. But if you look at the current industry landscape, what you just said is nothing new. Everyone have their wafer produced in one location and packaged in another even including major chip producer in U.S. So for that matter, we do not see and compose any logistical difficulties. We just continue to evaluate, and currently, we do not have that 3D IC fab in Arizona at this point. Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you. Next one, we have Andrew Lu from Sinolink Securities. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. My first question is regarding 3-nanometer ramp-up for second half, starting from second half next year. I recall the 7-nanometer ramp-up in year 2018 second quarter with some revenue contribution and the 5-nanometer in second quarter last year, year 2020. But it seems like 3-nanometers clearly some delay for second half next year. So I want to ask, is that because the technology difficulty, we cannot ramp up in second quarter or we don't have a big customer to use 3-nanometer at the beginning stage that's why we push back the ramp-up in second half next year? That's my first question. Okay. So Andrew's first question, let me summarize, is asking about our 3-nanometer ramp. He notes that 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer in the past few years basically ramped in the middle of the year. And 3, we said the ramp will be in second half of next year. So what is the reason behind this? Andrew, you have a very good observation and you calculate that, yes, about 3 to 4 months is a delay as compared with 5-nanometer. Yes, 3-nanometer technology actually is very complicated and in both processing technology and also the customers' product design. So we work with a customer, and finally, we decided to ramp up in the second half of next year. And this is -- we decided with our customer with the best fit their need. Okay. Thank you. Okay. My second question is recently, we believe NXP, Infineon, Renesas earlier either have some power down outage and also the fire resulting their second quarter or first quarter utilization down to almost 0. And recently, we are hearing these guys are back in the utilization rate to 100%. The wafer output may start appear in Q4. Most of these companies are leading company in automotive semiconductor, including MCU. Do we have some concern once these customers are ramping up their own fab and that will result the next year or starting from Q4 the order automotive semiconductor to us will be reduced -- largely reduced. Okay. So Andrew's second question is on automotive. He asked as IDMs ramp up their production in the second half, are we concerned or do we have concerns that heading into the end of this year or into 2022, that TSMC's automotive customers will greatly reduce their orders to TSMC? Andrew, this is C. C. Wei again. Let me answer your question. A very short answer is that, no, we don't have any concern. The reason is very simple: because of we offer the technology and our customer working closely with us. And for some of the technologies, mostly in the leading edge -- not the leading edge, I'm sorry, it's 55-, 40-nanometer and 28-nanometer that our customers need TSMC's support and the demand will continue to grow. And so we don't worry about once they bring up their fab and then TSMC's demand will be decreased. The answer is no, and remember tight and actually very tight in 2022 also. Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next one, we have Martin Lau from FSSA. The first question relates to politics. I counted, you said geopolitical risk 5x during today's call. And someone mentioned about the fact it seems in Taiwan with vaccines are getting even more political. I just wonder, for management, how concerned are you with politics? It seems the U.S. sometimes is fighting against China; China, Taiwan. And what things have you thought about to mitigate, if anything, such political risk?
And also, are your customers concerned when COVID happened in Taiwan, when China from time to time threatened a war against Taiwan? And are your customers concerned that they are so reliant on you? Okay. So Martin's question is about politics and geopolitical risks. He notes that geopolitical is talked about more and more. His observation is that vaccines in Taiwan has become a political issue as well. So he wants to know how does TSMC manage or mitigate the political risks looking at U.S., China, Taiwan relations?
And do our customers have concerns on things such as the recent increase in COVID or the threat of invasion from China? And how does TSMC manage these risks? Martin, this is Mark. Thank you for asking. First of all, the -- on the recent COVID situation in Taiwan, I think the confirmed case has dropped. And of course, the current -- first priority is to get the people of Taiwan get vaccinated upon variants keep coming. But I'm really grateful that us and YongLin and Foxconn come together a humanitarian donation of 10 million doses of vaccine to the Taiwan government, CDC -- Taiwan's CDC and be able to vaccinate our people in Taiwan because TSMC's employees is inevitably embedded in the community of Taiwan, and that is important.
The reason -- you know this could be political in the beginning. But at the end, we completed the contract and we did get support from all sites. So I don't think at the end it's as political anymore. Otherwise, this donation wouldn't be successful.
In a global sense, the geopolitical development is continuing. I think this is a challenge for every company. Every company's management has to deal with it. And -- but I think in the new administration from U.S., I think the development is more predictable, more rule-based. So as long as rule-based, I think it's better for every company to adopt it, too.
So that also prompted the talk I have earlier -- given earlier that the global manufacturing footprint may need to do an adjustment for our customers. Our customers in different countries, their infrastructure, supply security -- semiconductor-related infrastructure, supply security maybe come up a higher priority, and we do that adjusted to it. But of course, there is the customers' needs that we are adjusting it to upon the greater geopolitical development.
As to the invasion of China, let me tell you, nobody -- I mean, everybody wants to have a peaceful Taiwan Strait. And because not only -- because it is to every country's benefit, but also because of the semiconductor supply chain in Taiwan, no one wants to disrupt it. You have a COVID -- only a COVID situation already made a major disruption for the global economy. And I don't think that any disability in Taiwan Strait is any country wish to make it happen. So I'm optimistic on that. Thank you, Martin. Thank you. Do you have a second question, Martin? Yes, yes. Can I follow up with a second one? It's kind of related. You mentioned about global manufacturing. You also mentioned about the need to maintain your highest -- most of your technology in Taiwan because of the proximity to R&D. My understanding is majority of our engineers are from Taiwan.
As you go for this global manufacturing, do you -- can you talk about how you are changing, say, for example, your talent acquisition? Like how you try to get more people outside Taiwan so that maybe over time you can become more manufacturing outside Taiwan?
And also maybe on the Board, I mean, because when I look at the Board, it remains largely Taiwanese. The recent 2 additions, one is Dr. Kung who's a minister; Yancei who's from Delta. Do you see also the Board maybe changing, become more international? Or maybe if I try to propose some debate, have a Mainland Chinese on the Board? Okay. So Martin's second question is around talent and Board composition. Basically, with our expanding manufacturing footprint, he wants to know what is our strategy to attract more global talent for TSMC.
And his secondary question is also on the Board. His observation is that we -- the new Board members are primarily only from Taiwan. So will we consider board members from other countries? The question about talent. Indeed, I think the -- we have been advocating the talent development in semiconductor field in Taiwan as well as in U.S. I think semiconductor industry talent has been underdeveloped over the past decades. And today, everyone look at the semiconductor as a key economic drivers. So the talent needs to be connected with that. And in Taiwan, I think we have been advocating the government to set up the high-end advanced research colleges across the Taiwan major universities.
In the U.S. and also President Biden talked about semiconductor human infrastructure, that is to develop the human talent in semiconductor through the vast investment of the R&D. So this is catching up in every place. And particularly in Taiwan, we get very strong support from the local government to be able to continue to supply talents in Taiwan.
As far as the Board member, yes, Delta, Yancei has joined a year ago. And more recently, I think this coming shareholder meeting, we will nominate Rafael Reif, who is the President of MIT, to come to our Board. And we hope that it will go through the blessing of our shareholders. And that is a major increment of our corporate governance and particularly in the area of the talent development.
We invited chair -- Board members upon they have a very strong knowledge and experience on the corporate governance. And that is we will continue to look for without any differentiation about nationalities. Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Martin. Yes. The last one to ask question, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. I had two of them. The first one, you spoke about investing $100 billion in CapEx over the next 3 years and how that does not include specialty process nodes like the ones in Japan. I'm kind of curious, can you just be more specific on how much you plan to invest in your U.S. Arizona fab or fab clusters over the next 3 years in terms of CapEx? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. So Krish's first question is about our investment in CapEx looking at the next 3 years. He wants to know how much specifically we are investing in Arizona? Okay, Chris. We have announced that the Arizona project will be a $12 billion project. This was announced last year. Got it. And can you just elaborate how much you plan to do it over the next 3 years? So he wants -- Chris is asking how much will we invest in Arizona over the next 3 years. Yes, $12 billion. Next 3. Next 3. Close to. Well, basically, is next 3 years is about $8 billion. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then a quick follow-up. Your auto revenues was 4% of total revenue. What technology node is that predominantly? Okay. So Krish, your second question is on automotive. It was 4% of our revenue. What particular specific nodes is automotive using? Krish, I think I have mentioned that automotive MCU is the biggest one that we have and it's in 55-, 40- and 28-nanometer with the majority still in 55 and 40. And in the next 2 to 3 years, it will be moved to 28-nanometer. That's in our current plan, and we are working with our customers on that. Thank you, C.C. Thank you, Krish. All right. This concludes our Q&A session.
Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 4 hours from now. And the transcript will become available 24 hours from now. Both of these, which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay safe and healthy, and we hope you will join us again next quarter. Thank you, and have a good day or good evening.","TSMC's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call will be live audio webcast . tsmc's vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will discuss our operations in the second quarter . second quarter revenue increased 2.7% sequentially in NT dollar terms .",0.0
2021-10-14,14,10,2021,104.02979278564452,-0.11221390477113191,0.0,1.0,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2021,"[Foreign Language] Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TSMC's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This is Jeff Su, TSMC's Director of Investor Relations and your host for today. 
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode. 
The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2021 followed by our guidance for the fourth quarter 2021. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages, then we will open the line for Q&A. 
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release. 
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter revenue increased 11.4% sequentially in NT terms or 12% in dollar terms. Our third quarter business was driven by strong demand across all 4 growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications. 
Gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 51.3%, mainly due to the improvement in back-end profitability and a more favorable technology mix. Operating margin increased 2.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.2%, mainly due to better operating leverage. Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 6.03 and ROE was 30.7%. 
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 18% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 34%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 52% of wafer revenue. 
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 15% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 9% to account for 37%. IoT increased 23% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 4%. And DCE decreased 2% to account for 3%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 976 billion or equivalent USD 35 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased TWD 8 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 24 billion in accounts payables and the increase of TWD 6 billion in dividend payable, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 21 billion in short term loans. 
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 50 billion mainly as we raised TWD 49 billion corporate bonds during the quarter. 
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 40 days while days of inventory remained at 85 days. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 319 billion in cash from operations, including some customer prepayments, spent TWD 189 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 65 billion for fourth quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased TWD 18 billion, while bonds payable increased by TWD 49 billion. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 106 billion to TWD 854 billion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled USD 6.77 billion. 
I'll finish my financial summary. Now let's turn on to our fourth quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 15.4 billion and USD 15.7 billion, which represents a 4.5% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 39% and 41%. 
On July 12, we announced we have completed the purchase of 5 million doses of vaccine as part of our efforts to help fight against COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. We recognized a small portion of the vaccine donation expense in the third quarter and the majority of it will be recognized in the fourth quarter, which will have around 1 percentage point impact on our operating margin. 
This concludes my financial presentation. 
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our 2021 capital budget. 
Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications. In order to support our customers' growth and meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have budgeted our full year 2021 CapEx to be around USD 30 billion. 
Next, let me talk about our profitability. Our third quarter gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 51.3% mainly due to better back-end profitability and technology mix. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28, we have just guided fourth quarter 2021 gross margin to be 52% at the midpoint. 
The midpoint of our fourth quarter gross margin guidance also implies that our full year 2021 gross margin is expected to be higher than 50% despite the rapidly rising depreciation cost, the dilution from N5 ramp and the unfavorable foreign exchange rate in 2021 as compared to 2020. 
As we have discussed before, 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership, technology development and ramp-up; pricing; cost; capacity utilization; technology mix; and foreign exchange rate, which is not controllable. Taking all these factors into consideration, we believe our long-term gross margin of 50% and higher is achievable. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of TWD 414.7 billion or USD 14.9 billion, driven by strong demand across all 4 core platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive-related applications. 
Moving into fourth quarter 2021. We expect our sequential growth to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology. Based on the midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance, our full year 2021 revenue is expected to grow about 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. 
On the inventory front, we continue to expect our customers and the supply chain to gradually prepare a higher level of inventory in the second half of this year as compared to the historical seasonal level. Given the industry continuing to ensure supply security, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory for a longer period of time. 
In the near term, we continue to observe short-term imbalances due to interruptions in the supply chain brought about by COVID-19. We also continue to observe the structural increase in long-term demand, underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications and the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking and smartphones. 
While the short-term imbalances may or may not persist, we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies, and we expect our capacity to remain tight in 2021 and throughout 2022. 
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth driver and return. We are entering a period of higher structural growth. The multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel a massive requirement for computation power and propel greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demands the use of leading-edge technologies. These megatrends will not only spur unit growth but also drive increasing semiconductor content in HPC, smartphone, automotive and IoT applications. 
COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive and essential in people's lives. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, TSMC is better positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend with our differentiated technologies. 
To address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their demand. 
Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customer's trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node, new investment in mature nodes, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint and rising material and basic commodity cost. 
As we continue to work closely with our customers to support their growth, our pricing strategy will remain strategic, not opportunistic, to reflect our value creation. We will also continue to work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. 
Even as we shoulder a greater burden of the investment for the industry, by taking such actions, we believe we can achieve a proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth with 50% and higher gross margin for our shareholders. 
Now let me talk about our Japan fab plan. We are expanding our manufacturing footprint to sustain and enhance our competitive advantage in providing industry-leading technologies, the world's largest logic capacity, efficient and cost-effective manufacturing and to better serve our customers. 
Our global manufacturing expansion strategy is based on customers' needs, business opportunities, operating efficiency and cost economic considerations. After conducting due diligence, we announced our intention to build a specialty technology fab in Japan, subject to our Board of Directors' approval. 
We have received a strong commitment to support this project from both our customers and the Japanese government. This fab will utilize 22-, 28-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in 2022 and production is targeted to begin in late 2024. Further details will be provided subject to the Board approval. 
We believe the expansion of our global manufacturing footprint will enable us to better serve our customers' need and reach global talent while earning the proper return from our investments and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
Finally, I'll talk about the N3 and N3E status. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 risk production is scheduled in 2021, and production will start in second half of 2022. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tapeouts for N3 for the first year as compared with N5. 
We also introduced N3E as an extension of our N3 family, N3E will feature improved manufacturing process window with better performance, power and yield. Volume production of N3E is scheduled for 1 year after N3. 
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that N3 family will be another long and last -- will be large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
This concludes our key message. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line. The first one to ask questions, Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Congrats on the good results. My first question is on the long-term road map. Intel has now unveiled their long-term road map until 2025 with 4 process nodes, looking to catch up with TSMC and potentially even overtake. Could TSMC talk a little bit more about its own longer-term road map, timing of adoption of some of the new technologies like gate-all-around, high-end EUV battery power line, et cetera?
And where does TSMC see itself from a process technology leadership perspective in the next 3 to 5 years? The entry message is definitely well received. But maybe could we talk a little bit more longer term, given some of your competitors are kind of addressing that kind of time frame as well? That's my first question. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Please let me summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is about -- regards to our long-term technology road map. He notes that in IDM, he notes, outlined their long-term road map for the next 3 to 5 years and talking about catching up and overtaking. So Gokul wants to know what are our views or plans or our road map, I guess, around the timing of new technologies, such as new transistor structure like gate-all-around, high-NA, et cetera. And how do we see our technology leadership positioned in the next 3 to 5 years? Okay. Gokul, I don't comment on my competitors' technology road map or their technology approaches. But for TSMC, we are confident that we'll be very competitive. And we do have a very competitive schedule. Actually, let me share that in our 3-nanometer technology and the 2-nanometer technology. And I can share with you that in our 2-nanometer technology, the density and performance will be the most competitive in 2025. And of course, I can also share with you that the gate-all-around structure is being considered, although I'm not going to -- not ready to release more information about it. 
So that's, again, let me conclude in 1 sentence we'll become very competitive and we are confident that our technology leadership will be maintained. Okay. Thank you, C.C. Gokul, do you have a second question? Yes. So looking at CapEx, I think back in Q1 results, TSMC indicated spending $100 billion-plus in CapEx over the next 3 years. Since then, you have talked about Japan capacity expansion. It looks like there are some capacity expansion plans for leading-edge in Taichung as well. Could we talk a little bit about is $100 billion going to be enough? Or do you still need to see -- do you still see some upside to this $100 billion budget on the CapEx over the next 3 to 4 years since the growth seems to be stronger? 
And if we see that upside in CapEx, are we still looking at the high end of 10% to 15% growth CAGR? Or do we believe that there could be faster growth than this 10% to 15% -- or high end of 10% to 15% that we had talked about previously? Okay, Gokul. Let me see if I can catch. Your second question is around our CapEx and growth -- longer-term CapEx and growth outlook. So Gokul is asking what sort of our plans in Japan and plans for expansion in Taiwan. Will there be upside to this $100 billion CapEx number that we have talked about in the previous -- for the next few years? And then also, will there be a higher long-term growth CAGR target as a result as well? Okay, Gokul. This is Wendell. Let me answer your question. We are not able to comment specifically on next few years' CapEx. Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return, as C.C. just mentioned. 
Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we said, we are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand, underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications and increasing silicon content. So as long as our growth outlook looks good, there could be upside to our CapEx plans, and we will continue our disciplined investment approach to support our customers and capture the growth opportunities. 
Now in terms of our revenue CAGR, we're not planning to make any changes at this moment. We will provide you with more information in our January conference. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I think my first question is that 80% of TSMC's CapEx is focused on advanced node capacity expansion. And do you see that the mature node becomes the bottleneck for your customers? How do you ensure your customer can have enough mature nodes or chips? Okay. Sorry, Bruce. Let me repeat your question. Question is around the mature nodes and that with 80 -- typically, a majority of our CapEx is for the leading nodes. So how can we ensure that our customers will not be bottlenecked or have enough on the mature nodes as well? Okay. Bruce, let me answer that question. TSMC's strategy at mature nodes is to work closely with our customers, to develop and invest in specialty technology solutions, to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. We take a holistic view and work with our customer to decide the optimal capacity to support their demand. Okay. Okay, okay. Does that answer your first question, Bruce? Yes. Let me try to answer it -- ask for different questions. So I think recently, we have a lot of investors asking that there are a lot of noise on the end demand, such as on the TV or China's smartphone. The inventory level is all at a higher level. But the foundry outlook remains very, very positive and almost everyone is raising their capacity and CapEx.
And can you try to tell the investor what's the discrepancy? And where is the -- why the foundry can continue to see such a strong demand while the end demand is deteriorating? Okay. So Bruce, let me summarize your second question. Second question for Bruce is around looking at end demand in the foundry. Bruce notes that there's a lot of, I guess, noises about different types of end demand, however, the foundry outlook seems to be very positive. So how do we explain this disconnect or discrepancy? Okay, Bruce. Let me say that while we do not rule out the possibility of an inventory correction, but we expect TSMC's capacity remain very tight in 2021 and throughout 2022. This is because of our technology leadership position.
And even there's a correction to occur, we believe it could be less volatile for TSMC than previous downturn at our underlying structural megatrend of 5G-related and HPC applications. And actually the increasing silicon content, in addition to the unit growth, in the end devices will continue.
And again, with our technology leadership, we are better positioned to capture the mid- to long-term growth opportunities. I hope that answers your question regarding discrepancy between the demand and why it's still very tight in capacity. Thank you, Bruce. Next one, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. I wanted to ask, probably for Wendell, a few questions on the margins. You mentioned 50% and above. Just a couple of follow-ups on that. Should we think it's still within a couple of points of 50% or with efforts to firm up pricing, you could push it higher? Just reflecting to maintain return on capital, you will have a higher asset base. And that's kind of first part of that question. 
And then within margin, if you can update us on the inefficiencies you had operating at a high level, if you've worked that out. And also if you have an initial view on depreciation for 2022. Okay. Randy, let me summarize your question. So your question is about our margins. So Randy notes that we now say 50% and above. He wants to know, is this a couple of points above? How high above? And will we be able to maintain our, I guess, ROIC or ROE as a result?
And also that last time, we had talked about sort of running at a high level of utilization and certain inefficiencies. So has that now become more improved? Or what is the outlook there? And also the depreciation outlook for 2022. Okay. Let me answer the last question first. Depreciation in 2022 will increase. But the magnitude, we are going to tell you next year in January. 
For the margin, how many percentage points over 50%? We don't want to disclose it right now, but we hope we can tell you more in the January investor conference. And that will, of course, bring a better ROE than before due to the higher margin targets. You also asked about utilization? Randy also asking about inefficiencies. When we had talked previously about when we run at a high level of utilization, less-efficient cost improvement and things like that, so Randy is wondering, is this -- is it continuing? Is it... The utilization continues to be pretty high. At the same time, the cost improvement activities is ongoing. As a matter of fact, in the fourth quarter, we believe the margin will be better, partially because of the cost improvement activities. Okay. Great. Then second question I'll ask. And just one quick follow-up. Actually, related to utilization 50% and above. If you have a utilization view, is that a 90% or is that full capacity?
And then the second question I have is on the capital intensity. One of the equipment suppliers, Tokyo Electron, they put up a slide about a moderating increase in capital intensity. So CapEx per K. They have it like 2-nanometer just rising gradually to 210 million per 1,000 wafers. Could you discuss, if you can, a CapEx per K either absolute or how you see that trending?
And do you see that continuing to accelerate up or actions you're taking to keep it more stable after the increase we've seen in the past few years? Okay. So Randy's second question is about capital intensity. He notes that Tokyo Electron is showing that the capital intensity or the CapEx per K is moderating the pace of increase, particularly as you get into 2-nanometer. So he was wondering if we can just comment on our CapEx per K. Well, Randy, I -- what I can share with you is that CapEx per K for advanced -- more and more advanced technology is normally higher. That's for sure. So -- but at the same time, through selling our values and working with the customers and the suppliers, we believe we are able to still earn a proper return, which is, at this moment, a 50% and higher gross margin is achievable. Okay, Randy? Thank you, Randy. Next one to ask questions, Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Yes. My question was on the N3 introduction next year. Can you talk a bit about the ramp-up of N3? Is it going to be a typical ramp very similar to the last couple of node ramps? Or do you see the timing of this being different?
And also, just in terms of the cost, there's a lot of talk about cost rising above expectations for N3 as you add more EUV layers. Can you just clarify how you see costs at N3 and whether you can still achieve a 70% density gain at that node? Okay, Brett. So let me see. Your first question is around N3. Brett wants to know with N3 ramping in the second half of next year, what type of ramp do we expect versus the prior nodes? Will it be typical? Or will the timing be different? And also on the N3 cost, what does the N3 cost structure look like? Is that your question, Brett? That's right. Okay. Brett, this is C.C. Wei. Let me answer your second part of the question first. N3 is of course -- definitely it is higher than N5. That is because of technology complexity and we have to use many new equipment, which is -- cost higher.
But then, the ramp-up is very similar to the previous node. With many customers' engagement, actually, it's higher than what we observed in the previous node. So second half of 2022 will be our mass production, but you can expect that revenue will be seen first quarter of 2023 because it takes long -- it takes cycle time to have all those wafer out. Okay. So basically, on 3-nanometer, this won't be -- typically, you'd see your first revenue Q2 or Q3. It's going to be later of next year, is that right? That's right. Yes, Brett. I think we have been consistently saying that N3 will begin the production in second half 2022. That has been a consistent message since we first introduced N3 in 2019. Okay. Great. And maybe just a follow-up on 28-nanometer. You just talked about a new fab that's coming on stream in 2024 in Japan. And can you maybe just clarify the latest thinking in terms of Europe? Because I don't know that we could -- we may see new fab expansion for TSMC.
And then in terms of looking at the 28-nanometer node, there's a lot of capacity being expanded at the moment. Can you talk about what's driving this? And why you think this will not lead to an oversupply situation in time? Okay. Thank you, Brett. So Brett's second question is around 28-nanometer. Two parts. First, of course, that C.C. just announced our intention to build 28-nanometer in Japan. So Brett wants to know, do we have plans in Europe? And then the second part is that with 28-nanometer, what is driving the longer-term structural demand for 28? Is there a risk of oversupply of 28-nanometer? Okay. We don't rule out the possibility of building a fab in other areas, that including the Europe. However, we do emphasize when we build up a new capacity for 28-nanometer, it's almost all to serve the specialty technologies, for some of the specialty technology that is not offered by our competitor. And TSMC is working with our customers to meet their demand. So is there any possibility of oversupply? Not for TSMC, okay? That's all I can let you know. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Next one to ask questions, Roland Shu Citigroup. So my first question is, you have a global manufacturing expansion strategy to build more fab overseas going forward. Like you said, you also don't exclude the possibility to build a fab in Europe. So my question is, is a joint venture with a local government or key customers an option for you to build this new fab overseas? Or you prefer to build a fab at 100% owned, like what do you bid for those fabs in China or U.S. that you are building now? Okay. Roland, your first question is about our overseas fabs. Roland wants to know, as we expand overseas, will we consider joint ventures with local governments or our key customers? Or will we continue to -- or will it be 100% owned, like what we have done in China and in the U.S.? Okay, Roland, let me answer these questions first. Normally, as you mentioned, our overseas fabs, we normally own 100%. We do not consider a JV with government. However, JV with other companies or key customers can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Okay. Yes. My second question is on your -- now you've set a short term goal of a zero emission goal by 2025, but you have to continue to invest in 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer or even 2-nanometer before 2025. So how are you going to achieve this zero emission growth target and also, in the meantime, keep up with your expansion plan? So these right now, these are aggressive zero emission growth plan to decelerate your investment plans to meet your target. Okay, Roland. Roland's second question is asking that our commitment recently announced to zero emissions growth by 2025. But as we continue to invest and expand on N5 and N3, how will we be able to achieve this target? Okay. Roland, it's actually a net zero in 2050, not zero emission in 2025. We are going to do this first by working ourselves to save -- to become more energy-efficient because a lot of the carbon emission comes from the electricity. Our production, we can try to minimize the carbon emission.
And secondly, we are going to use more green energy, which is the -- which will emit the most part of the carbon. And for whatever is left, it will depend on carbon trading, the carbon rights in the future. So that's the basic framework of achieving this net zero in 2050. No. Actually, I'm talking about zero emission growth. So you have this near-term target, zero emission growth by 2025. So I know there's a difference from this, like in Europe 2050. Right. Yes. The way to achieve those are pretty much the same. I think when -- sorry. Roland, your question is about net zero emissions growth by 2025. And Wendell said, we have net zero emissions by 2050, right? So I think what Wendell was saying is that our -- we will continue to invest in technology, but we have also, as Wendell just said, our own internal efforts, our use of renewable energies, carbon credits and also working with our suppliers and our supply chain on green manufacturing to achieve and deliver on these targets. Okay. Understood. Okay. Thank you, Roland. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. So my question -- first question is about the chip shortage situation. I think the Chairman took an interview by Time Magazine, and his view is that there should be more than sufficient finished chip in the supply chain. So can you help us, our global investors, to understand when do you think that chip shortage, especially for the automotive can be fixed? And also, your advise to the major governments or car makers besides asking you to provide the customer data, what would be a better way to manage the shortage issue going forward? Okay. So thank you, Charlie. Charlie's first question is around the chip shortage with several aspects to it. Charlie wants to know, with the chip shortage and also sort of observations of customers' stockpiling chips, he wants to know that how do we see the situation? And when can this be fixed, particularly for the automotive segment? And yes, let me stop there first. Yes. For the automotive, let me specifically point it out. The automotive supply chain actually is quite long and complex. It's more complicated than we initially thought.
But let me say that TSMC's participation in the global automotive IC market is only about 15%. And we are doing our part to support our automotive customer with what they need. However, we cannot solve the entire industry's supply challenge. And recent factors, such as pandemic in Southeast Asia, are also affecting the auto IC supply. Again, we are actively taking the steps throughout the first half of this year to address the chip supply challenges for our automotive customer.
And we also believe the wafer supply shortage is greatly reduced for our automotive customers, starting probably in third quarter. The end of OEM, probably we'll wait for a couple of quarters to see it. That's our estimate. It's super helpful. And another question is about, again, the price hike, right? So I think news were reporting you decided to hike the price by 5% to 20%. So may we know how do you determine the different range applying to different customers? What's the kind of strategic reason behind for a different range of a price hike?
And I know you don't want to give the next year guidance, right? But based on the 5%, 20% price hike, in terms of percentage of gross margin improvement, can you comment on the margin improvement? Okay. Charlie's second question is asking about pricing and he is asking that recently, there's lots of news that we have increased our price by anywhere from 5% to 20%. So he wants to know how do we decide, how much to increase for what types of nodes or customers. And then also, what will be the impact to 2022 gross margin? Is that correct, Charlie? Yes. Charlie. In fact, we do not comment on our pricing, this is a very private discussion between TSMC and our customer. But let me say that we continue to work closely with our customers to support their growth. That one needed TSMC to expand the capacity to support their growth. It's for both leading-edge technologies and specialty technologies. And so our wafer's pricing strategy continue to be strategic, not opportunistic or short term and so that we can be better prepared to support the capacity expansion.
As for the return, let me emphasize it again. Our gross margin will be 50% and higher. TSMC needs to earn a proper return that can enable us to invest for the future expansion to support our customers' growth. Okay. I guess my question is that whether your desired ROI or desired margin changed, right? Meaning you -- for example, you hiked the price by certain percentage points, but besides passing through this cost, you just mentioned, whether they would lead to further margin expansion? I think that should be the core of my question. Right. Charlie, I think we just said that in the past, we always say above 50% gross margin. But now we're saying that 50% and higher gross margins is achievable. Thank you, Charlie. Right now, we have Nick Gaudois from UBS. Yes. Just going back to the confirmation you just did on investing in Japan. Should we understand that the portion of CapEx in 2023 is incorporated in your overall guidance of $100 billion? Or would that come on top? And would you -- could you specify it if you can at all? And related question to that would be, what kind of capacity are we talking about for 22- and 28-nanometer? Okay. So Nick's first question is about our fab plans in Japan. He wants to know that with today's announcement, is the CapEx for the Japan fab already incorporated in the -- this $100 billion target that we have talked about previously? And also, can we disclose the capacity for Japan? Okay, Nick. The CapEx for this project, as we said last time in last quarterly release, was not included in the $100 billion budget that you mentioned. So it will be incremental. Other than this, we really are not able to comment on the investment amount and other details until our Board's review and approval. Right. Okay. Fair enough. Understood. And going back to N3 and N3E. I mean you talked about an improved process window for N3E. Is that the only main difference? Or is there a difference in performance as well between the 2? Okay. So Nick's second question is on N3E. He notes that we have talked about the improved manufacturing process window. He wonders if there's any other improvements in things like performance and et cetera. There's a difference. As we said, N3E is an improvement, improvement in the manufacturing window. However, the majority and the general assumption is similar. We're using the N3E to enhance the manufacturing window with a better performance. Thank you, Nick. Next one, we have Laura Chen, KGI. I think we are talking about seeing the solid demand across the world, thanks to TSMC's strong position and technology. But on the other hand, on the demand side, we are also seeing that smartphone growth is slowing down, particularly in China. So I think back in the early -- earlier this year, we mentioned about a 5G smartphone shipment. We estimate that will be 500 million to 550 million units. Just wondering, do you still keep that target?
And also, do you have any idea or preliminary projection for the 5G smartphone into next year? And also, where is like the smartphone if 5G move into a more like a lower-end or mainstream kind of segment? What's the implication to TSMC? That's my first question. Okay, Laura. So Laura's question is focusing on the smartphone. She notes that recently, it seems the smartphone momentum in markets like China are slower. So she is wondering about what is our forecast for the smartphone market this year as well as how do we see the 5G penetration this year and then also the trend for the next few years. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Laura, let me answer this question. We see the prolification of the 5G smartphone is still higher than the 4G at the same period of time before. And also, we're looking at about probably slightly over 500 million units of 5G smartphone for this year. Right. So do you have any preliminary thoughts about the next year growth? And was that mainly driven by the lower-end segment? In that case, what's the implication to our outlook? Yes. We'll update you about the information in January. And also, my second question is also regarding our CapEx intensity. We already talked about like the 3-year horizontal, but just wondering that do we still expect the CapEx intensity to maintain high beyond 2023 since we are launching gate-all-around or 2-nanometer in 2025?
So can we expect TSMC will start to bear fruit like our previous intensity -- CapEx intensity  hike back in 2011, and thus, we will maintain the high CAGR growth going forward? Okay. So Laura's second question is on capital -- CapEx intensity. She is asking, what is the outlook for our capital intensity beyond 2023? Will we still have a very high level of capital intensity? Or she notes back in the 2010, 2011 period, of course, our capital intensity was higher, but then we were able to harvest the growth and grow -- capture the growth. So how do we see the next few years playing out? Okay. Laura, in 2020, the capital intensity was 38%. 2021, this year, is going to be over 50%. As we said earlier, and C.C. mentioned this earlier, our CapEx stand every year in anticipation of the growth in the future years. So if we think the future growth outlook is good, then there's a possibility of higher CapEx.
And we're entering into a higher-growth period because of the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC applications plus the silicon content increase. So the capital -- higher capital investment in the next few years is appropriate. As a result, we expect the capital intensity to be relatively higher than previous year, like in 2020, for the next 2 to 3 years before gradually coming down maybe to mid- to high 30s level from what I can see at this moment. And your observation on the previous investment cycle in 2011 to 2014 will be a good one. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Next one to ask questions, Sebastian Hou, Neuberger Berman. I only have one. It's on pricing. So I think last quarter, the company talked about firming up pricing to reflect the cost. And based on the higher long-term gross margin guidance that the CFO gives this time, a 50% plus, I'm curious if this round of pricing adjustment is enough to observe the higher CapEx intensity only for this year or next multiple years. I have a follow-up to this question, so I will stop here. Okay, Sebastian. His first question is on pricing, and we have talked about firming our pricing, actually also talking about selling our value in the past. So he is wondering, now that we say 50% and higher gross margin, does that mean we -- it is enough to cover the cost? Okay. Sebastian, let me answer it this way. Well, first of all, we're not able to comment on detailed pricing discussion with the customers. But we work closely with the customer to provide our value. And after providing our value, we're not expecting that long-term gross margin of 50% or higher -- and higher, I'm sorry. 50% and higher is achievable as compared to the 50 -- above 50% gross margin previously. Got it. Got it. So my follow-up is that given that the next couple of years' CapEx plan, it is still fluid, and I think CFO also mentioned there could be upside to our CapEx plan because of the Japan or any other reasons. So does that imply this will be a continuous adjustment? Meaning that it won't be just 1 shot, but we will evaluate the future pricing and what kind of value we can offer to customers based on the CapEx and based on our -- and also to balance the structural profitability. So that means that we may continue to see potential upside in the price in coming years? Okay. Sebastian, so your follow-up is, again -- let me summarize it. I think Sebastian is asking our pricing, is it sort of a onetime? Or will it be sort of an ongoing thing? Sebastian, this is C.C. Wei. Certainly, I will not be able to comment on the pricing discussion with our customers. But we work with them and we continue to plan our capacity and share our value. The capacity is one of the very important values of TSMC to support customers' growth. And so our pricing is accordingly with our value, and so we prepared for that.
This is a onetime or this is not? It's not a question. We do it strategically and not optimistic and continue to work with our customer. Got it. But at least I think we can make a fair conclusion that the higher-margin guidance outlook at this time is a strong reflection or evidence of that the customer is willing to pay higher to -- because of -- we offer value-added service. Is that right -- fair to interpret as it? Yes. Okay. Thank you, Sebastian. The next one to ask questions, Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna International. I want to go back to your comments on planned N3 and N3 plus. Can you tell me how I should think about EUV double-patterning and how it will impact the cost structure? And I have a follow-on. Okay. Mehdi's first question is about -- on N3. And actually, Mehdi, it's N3E, not N3 plus. So his question on N3 and N3E. He's wondering about the impact of things, like EUV and double-patterning. What impact does this have on the cost structure, for N3 and N3E? Well, let me answer that question. From N3 to N3E, we provide better value on the transistor performance and have a better manufacturing window. As for the cost, they are similar, but we think our customer will enjoy a better yield, better defect density and better transistor performance. Okay. And my final question would be to you. Your earlier commentary on customer prepayment. In the past, you've had 1 or 2 largest customers that have promoted prepayment. Should I assume that there is a diversification and larger number of customers that are providing these prepayments? Okay. So Mehdi's second question is on customer prepayments. He observes that in the past, we may have had 1 or 2 customers who do prepayments. He wants to know, are we seeing a diversification? Are we seeing a larger number of customers doing prepayments today? Okay, Mehdi, let me answer these questions. Yes, in the past, there was only 1 or 2 customers providing the prepayments. But as we've been talking now, we expect to invest higher capacity, higher capital expenditures in the next few years to satisfy the strong demand. And in order to secure our customers' commitment, we are able to secure the prepayments for some of those customers. And the number of the customer, I cannot disclose, but it's more than before. Okay, thank you, Mehdi. The next one will be Rick Hsu from Daiwa Capital Market. This is Rick. So the first question is about -- I think a follow-up to Bruce's question earlier about the disconnect between sell-in and sell-through demands. And I think C.C. mentioned that he doesn't rule out the possibility of the inventory correction. May I know if that happens, do you -- when do you expect that to happen? And also, if that happens, which area would feel the more impact in terms of technology nodes and in terms of the end applications? Okay. So Rick's question is, again, going back to the disconnect of sell-in versus sell-through and also that we have said we do not rule out the possibility of the inventory correction. Rick wants to know if one were to occur, when would it occur? What particular end segments or applications could be more impacted? Rick, I said we do not rule out the possibility. It's just a possibility. And all I say is TSMC's capacity will remain very tight in 2021 and throughout 2022. Which market sector? So far we observed a little bit soft in smartphone and the PC market. But if you ask me to predict, I cannot give you a very accurate prediction. We are the only one -- I can give you a hint as we continue to say.
It's not for the semiconductor industry. The demand does not only come from the unit growth, but also it's increasing silicon content in end devices. So even you saw some smartphone units become soft or even decrease, that doesn't mean that semiconductor or the business where the demand will go up. Does that answer your question? Yes. Perfect. Yes. That's very good. And the second question is on the technology migration. I remember that the 7-nanometer, you defined a 7-plus as a node for you guys to have a very good transition with EUV. So I'm just wondering if -- are you going to do the same thing to define a particular technology node for the GAA transition? Okay. So Rick's second question is about technology migration and transition. He notes that in N7, we had introduced also N7+ to transition and start to adopt EUV. So he's asking if we will incorporate a similar transition as we move to a new transistor structure. Well, I don't think that we can have any more information to share with you as we move from N3 to go to the next more advanced node. Today, I only announced the N3 to N3E, that we have a better transistor performance and better manufacturing window. For N2 GAA, we will share with you when we are getting more ready. Okay. Thank you, Rick. Now the one who's going to ask question is Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company. I just wanted to follow up. One is on C.C.'s prepared comments. You said the industry is going to maintain a higher level of inventory. Can you tell us the specific end markets and which specific technology nodes you're seeing with higher level of inventories? And your comment that you're seeing softness in smartphone and PCs. Is there a function of end demand? Or is it a function of not being able to get the components to make those products? And then I have a quick follow-up. Okay, Krish. Krish's first question is on the higher level of inventory that we see preparing in the supply chain. He wants to know which end markets or applications specifically or which technology nodes do we see this higher level of inventory. And then also, the slower momentum in the sell-through of smartphone or PCs, is this related to component tightness or shortages? Well, let me answer the question. The high level of inventory is actually is caused by some of the necessity, not to the disruption in the supply chain. So it's across the board. Actually, it's not any node or any product. It's across the board.
And we say it will be continued for a period of time. That is because of today, all those elements to drive the people to prepare more inventory still continue to exist. Did that answer your question? Got it. Yes, it did. And then just like the second part of this question, which is the softness in smartphone and PCs, is that end demand-related or component tightness-related? And then I'll ask one final question along with it. The gross margin upside you saw in Q3 from back end, was it a onetime thing? Or is there more upside to that in the future? Okay? So Krish's question, also sort of this weakness that we see in areas like smartphone, is it -- and PCs, is this related to end demand? Or is it related to component shortages? Both, actually. Let me answer the question quickly. Actually, end market is a little bit soft, it's slow, but we think it's partly due to the component shortage. And then the second part -- or Krish's second question, I should say, is on the gross margin side and also the improved back-end profitability. Right. The back-end business is sort of seasonal. It has high season, low season during the years. So normally, second half is high season, especially third quarter. As a result, the profitability of back end will be better in that quarter. Okay. Thank you. Yes. The last one to ask questions is Andrew Lu from Sinolink Securities. C.C., I want to ask. This year, you just guided 24% year-over-year growth. I think this number is probably in line with the industry. It is clear we have a strong growth in advanced technology but losing some share in the legacy. Earlier, Wendell mentioned we will build more mature technology based on the customers' demand. So if our CapEx is unchanged, will we adjust down our advanced CapEx but increase more CapEx on mature technology? Okay. So Andrew's first question, he's looking at our growth in 2021 to be around 24%. He sees the strong leadership in the advanced nodes, but his note is that we're losing share in the mature nodes. So going forward, will there be any adjustment in our CapEx strategy, leading versus mature? Is that correct, Andrew? Yes, correct. Andrew, let me answer that. We did not change our strategy or philosophy in our CapEx plan. But certainly, the most important thing is that we are working with our customers to support their demand. This is very important. That including the specialty technologies. We shared them -- actually, we shared them to increase the mature nodes capacity. But as we announced the Japan fab, actually it is a mature technology. It's a 22, 28 node. So can we say that in the future, we should have a higher percentage of CapEx in terms of total CapEx compared to the past? So Andrew really wants to know, well -- Andrew wants to know will the CapEx spending portion -- proportion of the mature nodes versus leading edge, will we have a higher proportion for the mature nodes in the future years? Andrew, not yet because we increased our CapEx, right? So even the same proportion, the mature nodes, actually, we spend a lot of money also. Did that answer your question? Yes, yes. My last question is, since we are adjusting our price based on the cost increase or whatever, how do we factor into our model for next year? What kind of blended ASP increase should we factor into our model? Because I have been -- observed average price on a blended basis for the last 3 years including this year.
Our price for last 3 years, including this year, about 7% to 9%. So if next year, we have additional adjustment on the apple-to-apple pricing level, should we say easy to have a 10% blended basis increase on ASPs? Okay. So Andrew, second question is on the blended ASP outlook. He wants to know, in essence, can he model a 10% or greater blended ASP increase for 2022? Andrew, it's too early to comment on 2022. We will provide you more color in January. Plus we don't really comment on ASP anyway. Okay. Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session.

The format for today's event will be as follows: First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the fourth quarter 2021, followed by our guidance for the first quarter 2022. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will host the Q&A session, where all 3 executives will entertain your questions. 
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release. 
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2020 (sic) [ 2021 ]. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2022. 
Fourth quarter revenue increased 5.7% sequentially in NT dollar or 5.8% in U.S. dollar as our fourth quarter business was supported by the strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology. Gross margin increased 1.4 percentage points sequentially to 52.7% mainly due to the continuous cost improvement efforts. Operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points sequentially to 41.7%, slightly ahead of our guidance as we enjoyed higher operating leverage and a portion of the vaccine donation expenses got pushed out to the first quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 6.41 and ROE was 31.3%. 
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 23% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 27%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 50% of wafer revenue. On a full year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 19% of 2021 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 31%. Advanced technologies accounted for 50% of total wafer revenue, up from 41% in 2020. 
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. All platforms increased in the fourth quarter. Smartphone increased 7% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC increased 3% to account for 37%. IoT increased 3% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 10% to account for 4%. And digital consumer electronics increased 2% to account for 3%. On a full year basis, all 6 platforms experienced year-on-year growth. HPC, IoT and automotive saw strong growth of 34%, 21% and 51%, respectively. Smartphone also increased 8%, and DCE increased 2% in 2021. Overall, smartphone accounted for 44% of our 2021 revenue. HPC accounted for 37% and IoT accounted for 8%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.2 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 84 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 22 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD 61 billion in accrued liabilities and others. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 150 billion mainly as we raised TWD 157 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 40 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 88 days. 
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 378 billion in cash from operations, including TWD 80 billion prepayment from customers; spent TWD 236 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for first quarter '21 cash dividend. Bonds payable increased by TWD 157 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 211 billion to TWD 1.1 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar term, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled USD 8.46 billion. 
Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2021. We saw a strong growth in 2021 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry's megatrend of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 24.9% in U.S. dollar terms to reach USD 57 billion. In NT dollar terms, revenue increased 18.5% as the NT appreciated by 5% during the year. Such unfavorable foreign exchange rate also impacted our gross margin by about 2 percentage points. In addition, N5 dilution also created headwind to our margin. However, as we continue to drive cost improvements, we were able to achieve gross margin of 51.6% and operating margin of 40.9% in 2021. 
Overall, full year EPS increased 15.2% to TWD 23.01, and ROE was 29.7%. On cash flow. We spent TWD 839 billion in CapEx while we generated $1.1 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD 273 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 266 billion in cash dividends in 2021. I have finished my financial summary.
Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be supported by HPC-related demand, continue recovery in the automotive segment and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 16.6 billion and USD 17.2 billion, which represents a 7.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.6, gross margin is expected to be between 53% and 55%, operating margin between 42% and 44%. Lastly, our 2022 effective tax rate is between 10% to 11%. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now I will move on to key messages. I will start by making some comments on our 2022 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and HPC applications. In 2021, we spent USD 30 billion to capture the strong demand and support our customers' growth.
In 2022, our capital budget is expected to be between USD 40 billion to USD 44 billion. Out of the USD 40 billion to USD 44 billion CapEx for 2022, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 2-nanometer, 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making and 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies. 
Our depreciation expense is expected to increase by low to mid-teens percentage year-over-year in 2022 as newly incurred depreciation will be partially offset by other nodes rolling off depreciation. With this level of CapEx spending in 2022, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our 2022 outlook. We expect 2022 to be another strong growth year for TSMC. For the full year of 2022, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow approximately 9% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be close to 20%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow between mid- to high 20s percent in 2022 in U.S. dollar term. 
Our 2022 business will be fueled by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see strong interest from all 4 growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. 
Entering 2022, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory as compared to the historical seasonal level given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security. While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications. We also observed the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking and smartphones. As a result, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 as we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies. 
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook and profitability. We are entering a period of higher structural growth. As the technology becomes more pervasive and essential in people's lives, and the digital transformation accelerates, the semiconductor industry value in supply chain is increasing.
As we embark upon the 5G era, an intelligent and more connected world will fuel massive requirement for computation power and prepare greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demand greater use of leading-edge technologies. The multiyear megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications will drive modest unit volume growth and more importantly, spur substantial semiconductor content enrichment in HPC, smartphone, automotive and IoT applications to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile. 
TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technology to support their group demand. At the same time, we are committed to achieve a sustainable and proper return that enable us to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
Over the last 3 years, we have raised our CapEx spending from USD 14.9 billion in 2019 to USD 30 billion in 2021 as we invest in anticipation of the growth that will follow. During the same period, our revenue in U.S. dollar term has increased from USD 34.6 billion in 2019 to USD 56.8 billion in 2021 or 1.6x and our EPS by 1.7x. 
Looking ahead, as the world's largest, reliable and effective capacity provider with our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend with our differentiated technologies. We expect our long-term revenue to be between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, of course, fueled by all 4 growth platform which are smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 
With the increasing need for computation, HPC will be the strongest driver of TSMC's long-term growth and expected to be the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth with the CPU, GPU and AI accelerators are the main growth area for our HPC platform. 
As we invest in leading-edge and specialty technology to support our customers' demand, we continue to face manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading-edge node, new investment in mature node, expansion of our global manufacturing footprint and rising materials and basic commodity cost. We are continuing to work closely with our customer to support their growth, and our pricing strategy will remain strategic not optimistic to reflect our value creation. 
We will also work diligently in our own fab operation and with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvement. By taking such actions, we believe our long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and proper return of greater than 25% ROE through that cycle. Thus, even as we shoulder a greater burden of CapEx investment for the industry, we can continue to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. 
Now I will talk about N5 and N4P and N4X status. As our N5 enter its third year of ramp, demand continues to be very strong driven by smartphone and HPC applications. Our N5 has proven to be the industry's most competitive leading-edge technology. To further enhance our N5 family's performance, power and density improvement for next-wave 5-nanometer products, we also introduced the N4P and N4X technologies. 
N4P offers 11% performance boost as compared to the N5 with 22% improvement in power efficiency and 6% density gain. N4P is designed for easy migration from N5 with its products tape-out schedule for second half 2022. 
We also introduced N4X as an offering especially optimized for workload-intensive HPC applications. The N4X will offer much more circuit performance boost over N5 and we expect it to enter risk production in first half 2023. With our continuous enhancement of our N5 process technologies, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, and for N5 family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Next, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status, our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete platform support for both HPC and the smartphone applications. N3 production will start in second half of 2022. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3, and expect the more new tape-outs for N3 for the first year as compared with N5. 
N3E will further extend our N3E family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. We also observed a high level of customer engagement at N3E, and volume production is scheduled for 1 year after N3. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that our N3E family will be another large and long-last node for TSMC. 
Finally, let me talk about our mature node capacity strategy. TSMC's strategy at a mature node is to work closely with our customers to develop a specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. We expect the multiyear industry megatrend of 5G and HPC and the higher silicon content in many end devices to drive increasing demand and mature node for certain specialty technologies.
We forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple specialty technologies. In support of our specialty technology strategies, we are expanding our 28-nanometer manufacturing capacity at sites in China, Japan and Taiwan. 
Our capacity expansion is based on customers' need, business opportunities, operating efficiency and cost economic considerations. We believe the expansion of our mature node capacity will enable us to better serve our customers' needs and reach global talents, and our differentiated specialty technology will enable us to capture the demand generated from the industry megatrend and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. This concluding our key message.
Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] 
Now we will proceed to the Q&A session. Our Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will be the host. Hello, everyone. This is Mark Liu. I want to send my regards to every one of you during this pandemic and wish we have a happy and a successful 2022. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Let's begin the Q&A session now. First to ask questions, Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse. Okay. Yes. Congratulations on the results and the outlook and margins. First question on the growth outlook. When we compare the growth expectation mid to high 20% versus if I roll up the fabless and IDM customers, they're about mid-teens growth. So your outgrowth looks much wider than most [ peers ]. Could you break it down a bit more, the factors between share gain, pricing moves? And also if there's any component of inventory build in there? Okay. Randy, let me summarize your first question. I believe your question is referring to the 2022 growth outlook. And Randy... That's right. Right. And so Randy is saying, TSMC's guidance of mid to high 20s percentage, his calculation show that the fabless industry is growing maybe around mid-teens. So we will outgrow the foundry -- sorry, the fabless. And so he is wondering what is driving this outgrowth. Is it share gain? Pricing? Are there other factors, such as inventory build, into this? And if we can share. Okay. Let me answer the question. This is C.C. Wei. Actually, the growth in 2022 is all the above you just mentioned. It's a share gain, it's pricing and also it’s unit growth. Did I answer your question? Yes, mostly. And maybe just a quick -- 2 quick follow-ups to that. If you could break the growth by platform and if you could indicate just how much -- like how much do you think your customers want to put in place more inventory? Like how big a component do you think that factor is? Okay. So Randy's follow-up is, can we give our 2022 growth by platform outlook? And then how much of a role is inventory build playing in this growth? Randy, this is Wendell. Let me answer the platform question. In 2022, we expect the HPC and automotive to grow faster than the corporate average. IoT, similar. Smartphones, close to the corporate average. That's the platform growth. And then Randy's second part is how much of a role is inventory build playing in this? Well, Randy, as C.C. mentioned at the key message is we expect the inventory level to remain high, higher than before for a longer period of time, but we're not able to quantify that factor. Okay. No, [ I understand ]. If I could ask a second question, you disclosed about the -- you're getting more prepayments and a lot of customers have been disclosing those. If you could talk about the strategy behind this as far as the main objectives of the program and the protection you're looking for if we go into downturn, what the scenario would be? So if you could disclose kind of that -- the strategy behind that. Okay. Randy, the prepayment, yes, we work closely and diligently with the customer to plan the capacity, including receiving their prepayments for capacity support. And we will continue to work with them to determine the best way to support them. Such commitments or prepayment will strengthen our cash position and help mitigate our capital risk in capacity. 
Now talking about securing commitment, we always work closely with our customers, and we believe that technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and earning customer trust are a -- the best -- or the most effective way to secure customer commitments. So as long as we plan our capacity well, based on the structural increase, in the long-term market demand profile, we believe our utilization and profitability can be well protected. Okay. Thank you, Wendell. Randy, does that address your second question? Yes. It was more about in a downturn, I guess, is it also a -- could it be assuring in terms of volume or [ still some ] cash flow like to protect the amount you have to outlay, so it is also kind of an insurance policy of some sort? Well, yes. Randy, I think, as I just mentioned, the best way is to work with the customers and gain their commitment through our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and therefore, earning their trust. So if we plan our capacity well based on the structural demand in the industry, that I think our utilization and profitability can be maintained. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Randy. Next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Congratulation for the great result. I think management mentioned about $1 trillion semiconductor market capacity in 2020 -- by 2030. So can we have more color about the foundry market sites by then? Or for the key growth drivers, such as HPC, can TSMC provide a more quantitative forecast? For example, like what is the addressable market for ARM-based CPU in 2025 or 2030? Okay. Bruce, let me summarize your first question. So Bruce is saying we have talked about a $1 trillion foundry market by 2030. So he wants to know what can be the key drivers here, and also the role of HPC, including ARM-based in this outlook. Okay. Bruce, this is Mark. We don't have a very specific forecast for 2030 to share with you. $1 trillion is our model and so has been quoted by general industrial comments.
However, we do believe that high growth approach to the number is happening. We believe the semiconductor industry growth will continue, fueled by the -- C.C. just mentioned, structural megatrend 5G and high-performance computing. And also, our leading-edge technology provide the most energy-efficient technology for computation and accelerate the digital transformation for the next several years.
So -- but if you look at the -- if we -- want me to comment, the foundry industry is pretty clear. The foundry industry growth will be higher because, in addition to fabless company, IDM outsourcing will continue increasing in a fast growth rate. And most importantly, system companies will grow, particularly faster during this period of time.
So in that sense, we believe the foundry growth -- foundry industry growth will have a good year better than other sectors. And then Bruce also asking about the role of HPC in this growth outlook, including the ARM. Well, ARM is a new phenomenon. I think the CPU architecture no longer been dominated by one architecture, multiple architecture provided their better integration with software, provide a much wider application of CPUs. And that no matter what the CPU, which architecture they are, currently, we are engaging to all CPU architecture customers. Okay. Bruce, does that answer your first question? Yes, but I try to ask a follow-up for the -- addressing for the HPC. I mean within that HPC, we understand that this is the fastest growing segment. Can you provide some more like different, like growth magnitude within the HPC? Which part of the HPC is growing faster? And how big would that be in 3 to 5 years? Well, Bruce, this is C.C. Wei again. No, we cannot disclose all the detail on each segment. For example, CPU, GPU and AI accelerator, which one is more -- what kind of percentage. In fact, they are all growing, but for the specific percentage, we don't comment right now. Okay, Bruce? Understand. Okay. Do you have a second question? Yes. The second question is regarding to the 28-nanometer. We know the 28-nanometer is the biggest node among all the -- process node within TSMC, and which is suffering low utilization rate in 2018 and '19. So with the recent announcement in Nanjing or Japan or even in Kaohsiung, it suggest another [ 15% ] of capacity growth in 28-nanometer alone in TSMC. Not to mention like your industry peer are all aggressively in expanding the 28-nanometer.
Can you provide like more like growth driver? And how can you feel comfortable to expand the capacity in this magnitude in the coming years when a lot of like financial industry were talking about like downside or a cycle peak, oversupply in 2023? Okay. Bruce's second question is on 28-nanometer. He notes that we are, as C.C. said, expanding our capacity in 28-nanometer in various locations, but he also notes that other foundry peers in the industry are also expanding as well. So he wants to know the risk, I guess, of oversupply. Well, good question. As you pointed out in 2018, 2019, we have a low utilization rate. It's just a little bit above 80%. But right now, we do observe that our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer was to be well supported by multiple specialty technologies such as CMOS image sensor for multi-camera trend and better nonvolatile memory application and other specialty technologies. To be -- in one word, actually, the enrichment in the silicon content in many end devices that developed in recent years helped to support this demand. Okay, Bruce? Great. Thank you. Next one to ask a question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Charlie, are you on the line? Yes, yes. Hello? Can you hear me okay? We can hear you now. Please go ahead. Okay. Congratulations for good results. So to management, my first question is about the macroeconomic risk, right? For example, inflationary pressure on the consumer tech demand. And also, work from home demand has been strong for 2 years. Will the management will consider that could fade away and impact your PC, TV or the semis.
And also lastly, the crypto mining demand has been very volatile, right? And now it seems like crypto price also falls down. So we'd like to know, management, whether you consider those kind of macro risks into your full year revenue growth forecast? Okay. So Charlie's first question is related to the macro outlook, looking at concerns of inflation, work from home setting, consumer demand and also crypto volatility. What impact could this have on end demand for PC, TV and semiconductors? And have we considered this into our outlook? Maybe C.C. can address this. Yes. Well, Charlie, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory for longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure the supply security. But then we also observed the end market momentum in certain segment may slow down or adjust in terms of units. But the increasing silicon content in many end devices is a more important factor in supporting the strong semiconductor demand and will continue.
So even if there's a correction were to occur, we believe it could be less volatile for TSMC due to our technology leadership position and structural megatrend demand of 5G-related and HPC application, the substantial increase in silicon content, that will make sure we expect our capacity to remain very tight throughout 2022. You also mentioned about cryptocurrency. Yes, we have factored that one in. Okay. Great. Charlie, do you have a second question? Yes, if I may. So a second question is maybe to Wendell that first quarter revenue see a great sequential growth, right? So may I know that are those price hike benefit mostly reflected in 1Q? Or there will be still some price hike benefits in the second quarter? And also, can you please repeat the depreciation growth guidance year-on-year for 2022? Okay. Charlie, let me summarize your second question. So his question is directed to Wendell. In terms of the first quarter revenue sequential growth, how much of the -- a price hike is reflected in this? And will a price hike be reflected in subsequent quarters? Charlie, we're not able to break down those numbers for you. But we continue to work closely with our customers, meet their demand and also sell our value. That's what we are focusing on. Yes. And the depreciation guidance, Charlie, this year is low to mid-teens year-on-year increase. Thank you. Next one to ask questions, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. First of all, could you give us an update on how we think about CapEx going into next couple of years as well, given the growth expectation is also now higher in the 15% to 20% range. Do we expect CapEx to peak out this year? Or should it continue to grow into next year? And maybe, Wendell, could you also talk a little bit about how we think about capital intensity? When do we expect that to peak? And what is more like the steady-state as we get to the end of this particular growth period 2020, 2025? That's my first question. Okay, Gokul, let me summarize -- allow me to summarize your first question. Gokul was asking about our CapEx outlook. He notes that we -- our growth is now higher at 15% to 20% CAGR for the next several years. So his question is, how should he think about the CapEx. Is 2022 the peak? How does CapEx look for the next few years, and also in terms of the long-term capital intensity? Okay. Gokul, this is Wendell. Regarding CapEx number, this year, we guided $40 billion to $44 billion. Now remember that we spent CapEx in the given year for the growth prospect in the next several years. So whenever there is -- we think the growth outlook is good, we will continue our discipline investment going forward. We're not able to give a guidance on CapEx beyond 2022 today.
And also the capital intensity. Whenever we enter into a higher period of growth like today, the capital intensity will be high and which is appropriate. Now if the growth were to slow down, the capital intensity will decline accordingly. From what we can see at this moment, longer term, maybe mid-30s remains appropriate level. Okay. Thank you. Does that answer your first question, Gokul? Hello, Gokul? Are you on mute? Yes. Sorry. My second question is about one of your IDM customer, which has been a top 10 customer for TSMC, but now they are also reentering the foundry market aggressively and wanting to compete head to head with TSMC.
How does TSMC navigate this situation given the market is also expecting this customer to be a bigger revenue contributor for TSMC in the HPC area over the next couple of years? Just wanted to understand how management thinks about this business relationship, given that for some of the other IDM customers who are foundry competitors, TSMC doesn't do much direct business with them. Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your second question. Gokul's second question is in terms of a specific IDM customer of TSMC, but this customer is also entering foundry and also -- so his question is, how do we navigate the relationship given that in the past, we do not really work with IDMs who compete with us? Okay. Gokul, this is C.C. Wei. Let me emphasize that we always operate in a good faith and support all our customer openly and fairly. And the IDM customer has been the same. That's -- also that’s TSMC's good customer. We also understand that the IDM customer has their own plans for future insourcing, and we already have taken this into our capacity planning consideration. Did I answer your question? Is there any way for you to protect your longer-term growth when you deal with this kind of a customer? Just wanted to understand how it differs from your traditional fabless customers where I think that insourcing question is not really on the table? Well, as I said, we have already taken into -- this into our capacity planning consideration. And our capacity planning is based on the long-term market demand profile, underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC and the semiconductor content enrichment in [ varied ] end devices. And we do not depend on any one single customer or product. Okay? Okay, Gokul? Yes. Thank you, Gokul. Next one to ask questions Roland Shu from Citigroup. Congrats for your very good results and outlook. First question of me is, C.C. you also mentioned, you always build your capacity according to customers' long-term demand profile. But in the past, from time to time, you overbuilt capacity for some nodes due to customers' focus always change. So how confident you are this time to [ comfortably ] spend a huge CapEx from 2021? And why do you think customers' focus this time are more real than any time before? And also, what's your take of this semiconductor cycle? Will this cycle change or risk your CapEx spending plan going forward? Okay, Roland. So Roland's first question is really C.C. said that we build our capacity according to the long-term demand profile. His question is though, customers' forecasts can change. So how confident can we be? And how do we see this current cycle playing out? Is that correct, Roland? Yes. Okay. Let me answer this question. For the difference, actually, this time, we see a structural increase in long-term market demand due to the multiyear industry megatrend of 5G, HPC and digitalization as well as some of the short-term imbalance that interruption of the supply chain brought about COVID-19 and geopolitical tension.
Let me say that how confident we are, very confident because, as I said, long-term structural increase in the content and in the unit. This time, we add the content increase as one of the important factor which we never reported before, and it was driven that semiconductor industry to -- at a higher utilization rate because we have a very good technology leadership. Yes, I have also a question, part of the question is for the cycle. What's your take of the semiconductor cycle now? Well, we cannot predict the cycle, right? But even if there is a cycle coming, we do believe that TSMC with its technology leadership and excellent manufacturing and the customers' trust will be a better position in the upturn or downturn cycle. Okay. Understood. Now for my second question. With your faster revenue growth and better margin going forward. For TSMC, apparently [ needs both ] capable and experienced management and employees are for continuous growth going forward.
However, some of your senior management are approaching legitimately retired age. So how are you going to retain the experience and the valuable management going forward? And also, by the way, what's the progress of your talent recruiting for your R&D and the manufacturing [ fab ] worldwide? Okay. So Roland's second question is that -- his question really is around our talent. Part of it is our senior management. How do we keep our experienced and senior executives? And also as we expand our global manufacturing footprint, what is the progress of our talent recruitment of engineers and R&D? Roland, this is Mark. You're right. Our capable executives are our treasurers and they will bring the company forward. And as long as they are energetic, and they will want to contribute for this company, there's no forced retirement. For those top-notch executives, we will work with them if they want to stay. Yes. And then also, how about our talent recruitment globally as we expand. Oh, yes. Talent recruitment, it is currently our focus as the company deal with this fast-paced expansion, and we recruit particularly emphasized on the overseas recruiting. And as you can see, our expansion into U.S. manufacturing and also in Japan manufacturing and -- are the vehicle that we will be able to reach for more global talents through those operation, and may extend to local R&D. So that is a part of our strategy. Thank you, Roland. Next one, we have Brett Simpson from Arete Research. My first question is for Wendell. Wendell, can you share with us how much prepayments and government subsidies TSMC received in 2021? And how we should think about prepayments and subsidies in 2022? And also, how do you account for this, particularly the subsidies, how do we account for this in the P&L going forward? Okay. Okay. Oh, sorry... Yes, go ahead. Sorry. Just to summarize Brett's question. So his first question, he wants to know how much prepayments and government subsidies that we received in 2021. How many -- how much do we expect in 2022? And how do we account for these in our financial statements? Okay, Brett. Let me talk about the prepayment first. At the end of last year, we have received a total of USD 6.7 billion in prepayment, and you can -- those are included in the financial statement as temporary receipts from the customers. So going forward, you can look at our quarterly financial statement and find that numbers.
As to subsidies, different country have different incentives and they come in different forms. So they are -- some of them are related to asset reduction, some of them offset expenses and some of them tax reductions. And we follow that -- we use different accounting treatment to record that in the financial statements. Okay, Wendell. I guess the prepayments this year will be higher than '21. Is that a fair statement? Well, I cannot share with you the details, but we expect that there are more. Okay. And my second question, looking at the smartphone segment of your business, it grew 8% in 2021, which is well below some of your big customers. Can you talk about silicon content drivers? 5G has been a really big silicon content driver in 2021, and it will continue to -- in 2022. So I'm just wondering, can you maybe just share with us your perspective on what happened in 2021 in smartphones? Why only 8% growth? And how should we think about smartphones and the positive silicon content drivers from 5G this year? Okay. So Brett's question is focused on the smartphone. He notes that our smartphone platform grew 8% in NT dollar terms year-on-year in 2021. So his question, I guess, Brett, if I'm hearing you correctly, your question is sort of what is driving the slower growth in the smartphone, despite the higher silicon content? Well, let me answer the question. I mean that's -- in terms of NT dollars, of course, it's only 8%, but in terms of the U.S. dollar, it's much higher. All right? And then the silicon content has continued to increase every year. So we expect that will be one of the major contributor to TSMC's growth continuously. Yes, I think -- let me add. The global smartphone unit growth last year is about 6%. So some of the -- you see some of the company smartphone revenue may grow, it could be due to the pricing. But we -- our pricing strategy, as you understand, is strategic, not optimistic. So we'll grow with the smartphone units in our business. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Next one is Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Just a very quick clarification. C.C., I think you mentioned about the N3 number of tape-outs in the first year, you expect that to exceed the number of N5 tape-outs in the first year. Since now you have both N3 and N3E, is that a comment on the original N3 alone or N3E family, which includes both N3 and N3E? Okay. So Charles' first question is that he wants to clarify in terms of tape-outs. When we say N3 tape-outs are greater than N5 in its first year. Is this N3E alone or N3 plus N3E? Well, it's N3 for right now because N3E we are -- technology will be ready soon, and the mass production will be 1 year later. So now most of the tape-out, all of them, are N3. So now I want to ask my question on potentially the gross margin profile for the N3. I know it's going to start to meaningfully contribute to revenue next year. You've said in the past that the newest process node will take about 7 to 8 quarters to reach the corporate average. But now this time, I think one difference about N3 is that you have both smartphone and HPC being supported at the right -- at the beginning of the launch of the N3 node.
So my guess is that the revenue for smartphone and HPC ramp could really go parallel instead of one after another and which could really help your volume, your revenue. And could you comment on whether that 7 to 8 quarter of the margin dilution of the newest process node, maybe starting from N3, it will become shorter. That's my question. Thank you, Charles. Please allow me to summarize your second question.
So Charles' second question is looking at the N3 profitability and gross margin. He observes in the past, and you know typically it takes 7 to 8 quarters to reach the corporate average, but at N3, we have both -- developed both smartphone and HPC platform. So if these ramp in parallel, could N3 actually reach the corporate average in a shorter duration of time? Okay. Charles, this is Wendell. It is too early to say when N3 can reach the corporate average gross margin at this stage as the volume production has not started yet. However, the initial outlook for every new node always looks challenging, and the increasing process complexity of leading nodes, such as N3, brings even greater challenges. We will continue to work on selling our value and cost improvement to ensure that we earn the right profitability and returns. Okay, Charles? Does that answer your second question? Yes, indeed. Okay. Thank you. Next one to ask question, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. The first one actually is a follow-up on the gross margin. For the March quarter, you're guiding to 53% to 55%, but your longer-term gross margin is around 63%.
So does that mean that, as we look beyond the Q1, there is a downward trend in gross margin? And also, how should we think about the long-term operating margin? And I have a follow-up. Okay. So Mehdi's first question is around gross margin. He notes our first quarter gross margin guidance is 53% to 55%. But Mehdi, let me clarify, our long-term gross margin guidance is 53% and higher gross margin. But nonetheless, Mehdi is asking, therefore, are we implying saying the margin outlook for the rest of the year will come down or decline? Okay. Mehdi, this is Wendell. We're not prepared to talk about gross margin outlook for the subsequent quarters of the year. But please be reminded that there are 6 factors affecting our profitability. Those factors include the ramp and development of our advanced technology, price, cost, mix, utilization and foreign exchange rate. The foreign exchange rate is something that we cannot control and hard to predict. So you -- these -- summarizing all those factors together, we're saying that long term, we expect our gross margin to be 53% and higher. As to operating margin, we're not giving out the operating margin guidance as of now. Okay. And quick follow-up. Can you also help us understand how the mix of revenue by process technology like 7, 5 and 3 would change in '22 versus '21? Okay. Mehdi's second question is asking revenue contribution by node. He is asking that N7, N5 and N3, how -- what contribution will that be in 2022? And how is that different versus 2021? Okay. Mehdi, we're not prepared to give the breakdown for the revenue contribution by node today. But the N5 will continue to ramp, so we expect the revenue contribution to continue to rise throughout the year. Yes. And I think we have said before, Mehdi, that N3 will begin the volume production in second half '22, and you will start to see the revenue contribution in 2023. Okay. Great. Congratulation on great execution. Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. The next one to ask question is Sunny Lin from UBS. So my first question is on N3. So you mentioned that the number of tape-outs for N3 is higher than N5 in the first year. So now that we are getting pretty close to the mass production, I want to get your sense on the overall capacity outlook for N3 compared with N5. And also, if we could -- if you could give us any sense of N3 revenue contribution in the first year of mass production? Okay, Sunny. So let me -- please allow me to summarize your question. Her first question is on N3. Will N3 have a higher capacity than -- or scale than N5? Well, this is C.C. Wei. I would like to say, I'm not able to comment on the specific capacity by node. But with a strong level of customer interest and engagement, N3 will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC just like our N5 and N7. And then Sunny is also asking about the revenue contribution of N3. It's still too early to talk about. Sure. Yes. No problem. So a follow-up will be that if we think about the N5 ramp-up, I think the second wave customer adoption seems to only occur in 2022, which is about 2 years after mass production. Looking at N3, with higher contribution and faster adoption of HPC, could you help us think about what the ramp-up could be like? Would the scale pick up a bit faster because of HPC? Okay. Sunny's second question is also on N3. And she notes -- her question is that in N5, the second wave of adoption occurred 2 years after the initial production, but with N3 and the higher and greater interest from HPC customers, would N3 see a faster ramp-up? Well, all I can say right now is our customers are engaged with N3. N3E are quite more than what we observed in the N5. However, how to quantify that ramp up, it's too early to say. The engagement is very strong. All I can say that. Sure. Maybe a very quick follow-up at the equipment supply. Are you seeing any potential bottleneck for you to ramp up a larger capacity for N3 next [ few ] years, especially considering potential disruptions for ASML's EUV tools? Okay. So last question from Sunny is that, in terms of our capacity expansion, are we seeing any bottlenecks or potential bottlenecks in our capacity plans, particularly in terms of ASML's EUV tools? Sunny, this is a very good question. All I can say right now is that 2022, we are okay. And now we are working on 2023 so that we can ramp up capacity to meet customers' demand. Thank you, Sunny. Next one, we have Sebastian Hou from Neuberger Berman. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I only have one. This is more of a mathematic question. So if I look past on TSMC, your -- how long did you translate your CapEx to your revenue? It looks around like 1.7x, which means that you use -- double your CapEx in 3 years. You'll probably double your revenue in 5 years -- or triple -- or more similar to that kind of equation.
So I'm curious about, this time around, whether that kind of relationship or translation time you'll hold. And then if I look at your CapEx numbers in 2018, is where -- 2019 is where you start to move your CapEx aggressively. And in 3 years, you triple CapEx. In 4 years, you quadruple your CapEx.
So if that equation continue to hold, then does that mean that you're -- by 2023 or '24 your revenue will be exceeded USD 100 billion? And by 2025, your revenue will be around USD 130 billion to USD 140 billion, which means that your long term over the next 3, 4 years' revenue CAGR, not just 15% to 20%, but actually 25% to 30%. Okay, Sebastian. His question really is about the relationship between CapEx and revenue. He's asking on his calculations, of course, how long does it take CapEx to translate into revenue? He observed in the past that the CapEx doubling in 3 years led to revenue doubling in about 5 years. So now he wants to apply it to this time to say, well, if CapEx has tripled from 2018, then can he expect TSMC revenue to be $100 billion. Sebastian, you said in 2024? 2023 to 2024. Oh, 2023 to 2024. Yes, around this level. And -- yes... So $100 billion level in kind of 2024, $130 billion to $140 billion in 2025. Okay. Sebastian, this is Wendell. Well, frankly speaking, we didn't do that kind of math ourselves. But what our guidance is, as C.C. mentioned earlier today, it's 15% to 20% CAGR in the next several years.
So with CAGR, doesn't mean that every year will grow that kind of a numbers. And also, it's next several years is a longer-term numbers. So I would not try to use the mathematics that you just used. It's -- things are not that simple, I think. Yes. Definitely not that simple. But maybe let me simplify the question a bit or put another way is that the CapEx to revenue translation time, do you see any change on that now versus 5 or 10 years ago? If it is slower or faster or the same kind of the pace? Yes, go ahead. Yes. So I think Sebastian is asking, so to try to simplify it in terms of CapEx to revenue. Are we seeing it at the same pace as in the past? Is it getting longer? Is it getting shorter? I think Chairman can address this. Let me answer this. I think because of the equipment lead time is much longer and also the technology complexity is longer. So that might increase a little bit in terms of the lead time leading to revenue. Okay. Thank you, Sebastian. Next one, we have Laura Chen from KGI. I have a questions on your overseas expansion. Just wondering, would TSMC consider joint venture in Europe, like what you announced in Japan? And what's your current preference? Do you prefer 100% owned? Or you would be more open for potential joint venture, like what TSMC did a long time ago in WaferTech and Singapore with NXP before? That's my first question. Okay. So Laura, let me summarize your first question. It is about our overseas fabs, and she's wondering will we consider joint venture as a future model going forward, whether it's in Europe or elsewhere?
Is this something that we have done with WaferTech in the past and also recently with Japan. Is JV, the new model going forward? Yes, Laura, this is Mark. To answer your first question about Europe, this is still very early stage. We are assessing. To start the overseas fab, there are many, many considerations. Among them, the top few is -- first is the -- our customers' needs. And so in this current planning in the Japan fab, indeed, it was a joint venture. We haven't done joint venture for many years. And we think this joint venture is a -- also a special case.
Typically, every TSMC fab, no matter where it's located we’ll serve all the customer from around the world. And this Japan joint venture were also the same. However, with -- in Japan, we have a very large customer who is a -- have a single technology, and we can also leverage their operating and manufacturing experience in Japan, which help us ramp in the learning curve. So that made us make the decision of a joint venture fab with Sony, where we have a majority share. So this is a special case. And we -- typically, we are considered to proceed a solely-owned fab with 100% ownership. Yes. That's very clear. And also, my second question is specifically on the N6-based RF transceiver. I recall that in your symposium back in June last year, you mentioned that the N6-based RF transceiver for 5G.
Can you give us more update, as we know that there's not much expansion on 16- or 12-nanometer, which are the major technology node for 5G, the RF transceiver? And with the limited supply, just curious about the N6-based 5G RF transceiver, would that become the mainstream? Or what TSMS's capacity plan in this area? And also the client engagement for the N6-based RFs? Okay, Laura, let me try to summarize. Her questions about RF transceivers for 5G. She wants to know, there doesn't seem to be any major capacity expansion. So what is TSMC's strategy for RF transceivers for 5G and also N6? You're talking in N16 or N6, sorry, Laura? The N6 because right now, most of the RF transceiver are in 16, from my understanding. Yes. Yes. But there is not much difference. So she wants to update on N6 RF transceiver strategy. Okay, Laura. We always are working with our customers closely, right? And the customer makes their decision to choose which technology node and to match their product design best. And you are right. Right now, transceiver is start moving from 28-nanometer to 16, and now moving to N6. We are expanding our capacity to meet the demand. That's all I can say. Did that answer your question? Okay. Yes. I think -- can I follow up that will we expect that N6-based RF will be the majority sometime, say, in 2023 or '24? So Laura's follow-up is, can we expect N6 RF to be the majority in -- by 2023 or '24? Well, Laura, I should not comment on that. This is between TSMC and the TSMC's customers. Okay. Thank you. Operator, in the interest of time, I think we'll take the final 2 questions. Next one to ask question, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Congrats on the really strong results. My first question is on gross margins. Wendell, you said long-term gross margin about 53%. The last couple of quarters, you said it will be over 50%. So is it safe to assume that the price increases are the big reason for this increase in gross margin? And are these structural? Or are they cyclical?
And is there some other variable in play given in gross margin improvement, since it's interesting that CapEx is going up, but the depreciation is not having an impact longer term on the gross margins? That's my first question. Okay. Krish, let me summarize your first question. So Krish notes that Wendell is -- and C.C. said our long-term gross margin target -- last time we said 50% and higher. Now today, we said 53% and higher.
So is this because of price? And is this a cyclical element only? Or is this something structural in terms of a higher 53% and higher long-term gross margin target? Yes. Well, let me share with you that. We're talking about long term. So several years down the road. I think that shouldn't be a cyclical issue. So previously, it's long term, 50% and higher. Now it's long term, 53% and higher, okay? So that's the difference. And we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to both sell our value and drive our cost improvements. So those are the -- this is the result of all these efforts together. Got it. Got it. All right. And then my second question is kind of a 2-part question. It's a CapEx and the OpEx question, you spoke about $40 billion to $45 billion in CapEx. Can you just tell us how much of the CapEx is going to be split between Taiwan and U.S. and Japan, like a geographic breakdown of the $40 billion to $44 billion? And the OpEx side, I understand you don't want to comment on long-term OpEx. But I'm just kind of curious, it's rising global inflation and your interest in recruiting talent in Arizona, how to think about OpEx growth relative to inflation growth? Okay. So Krish’s second question. First is in terms of the CapEx guidance that we gave this year, $40 billion to $44 billion. He wants to know what portion is for overseas capacity as compared to Taiwan? Okay. For this year, out of the $40 billion and $44 billion, we really don't -- cannot comment on the split between overseas and Taiwan. We normally split or give the breakdown guidance between advanced and mature specialty nodes. And then the second part is on OpEx. What is the impact? Although we're not giving an operating margin guidance, but rising global inflation, we're trying to recruit talent overseas. What is the -- sorry, outlook for our OpEx? Well, we try very hard, work very hard to control our operating expenses and to achieve operating leverage. You can probably see from the track records in the past few years and past few quarters that we're always able to achieve operating leverage, and that's something that we will continue to work very hard on. Okay. Thank you, Krish. Operator, in the interest of time, we will take the last participant's questions. Last one to ask questions, Frank Lee from HSBC. Just had a question, maybe if I can follow up on the CapEx. I think a year ago, you guys gave a longer-term 3-year CapEx target. I understand at this time, your CapEx is only given for 2022.
Just wanted to understand, are there any -- is there more uncertainties about giving the longer-term CapEx that [ it is why you're not seeing ] in the longer-term target being given? And I think last quarter, you guys have also talked about your CapEx intensity -- and it's going to be [ more than ] 50% in 2021. But long-term target, you said in the 30s.
But last quarter, I think it was implied that it was not going to come down to the 30s in the next 2 or 3 years. Is that still the case? That's the first one. Okay. So Frank's first question is on CapEx. He said we had talked about $100 billion CapEx in the next 3 years. His question is why are we not guiding for next 3 years CapEx now? Is there some concern we have? Okay. Frank, we will not comment on the CapEx outlook beyond 2022 to date. Please be reminded that every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow. So as long as our growth outlook looks good, then we will continue our investment approach, the disciplined investment approach, to support our customers and capture the growth opportunities.
And as regarding to the... Okay. And then I guess... Yes, the capital intensity. Yes. As I've said earlier that in the period of high growth, like today, it is quite normal or it is appropriate for the capital intensity to be high. And if our growth were to slow down, then the capital intensity is expected to decline accordingly. So from what we can see at this moment, you're asking several years from now or probably if a normal situation will probably in the mid-30s. Okay. But is that likely in the next 2 or 3 years? Or it's going to be further out until we get to that level? Long term, several years. I think we'll give you a year-by-year updates. Yes. Okay? Okay. Great. And then I guess my second question is, I think, a consistent message on this call was really about the semi content -- structural semi content growth. I think you guys have mentioned this a couple of times in this call.
Over the past year though, I guess, just wanted to get your sense of -- semi content growth something that seems like it's been well understood. But has there been an incremental surprise in terms of the semi content for you guys over the past year that has a more positive structural long-term growth? And if so, can you share what application? Or are we seeing content growth [ in mature nodes ] as well? Okay. So Frank's second question is on the semiconductor enrichment. His question is what are we seeing? Have we seen upside in the last year? And in terms of what specific applications are driving the semiconductor content enrichment. Maybe C.C. can address this last question. Yes, sure. I will give you a live example. If you look at the new car being introduced in the market, you all found out that the semiconductor content has been dramatically increased and the same happened to data centers, server and et cetera, et cetera. Okay? Okay. Sorry, I just have to pop in. Is it fair to say then that the semi content growth is something that is structured across all nodes, including advanced as well as some of the specialty... So Frank's question then with the semiconductor enrichment, is this only for the leading nodes? Or this also hold true at the mature nodes as well? Well, it's across all the technologies that I can say. I'll give you one example, again. If you look at the ADAS that the leading-edge technology, if we look at the power management, that's a mature technology. Okay. All right, Frank? Thank you. Thank you, C.C. Thank you, Frank.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TSMC’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This is Jeff Su, TSMC’s Director of Investor Relations and your host for today. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company’s website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. [Operator Instructions]
The format for today’s event will be as follows: first, TSMC’s Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2022, followed by our guidance for the second quarter 2022. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC’s CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company’s key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today’s discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC’s CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter.
First quarter revenue increased 12.1% sequentially at NT terms or 11.6% in U.S. dollar terms as our first quarter business was supported by strong HPC and automotive-related demand. First quarter gross margin increased 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 55.6%, mainly as we continue to sell our value and improve cost. Operating margin increased 3.9 percentage points sequentially to 45.6%, primarily due to lower vaccine donation expense as compared to the fourth quarter. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.82, and ROE was 36.2%.
Now let’s move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 30%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 50% of wafer revenue.
Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. All 6 platforms increased in the first quarter. Smartphone increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to account for 40% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 26% to account for 41%. IoT increased 5% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 26% to account for 5%. And DCE increased 8% to account for 3%.
Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.3 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 83 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 63 billion in accrued liabilities and others and the increase of TWD 30 billion in short-term loans, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 21 billion in accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 19 billion as we raised TWD 20 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 38 days, while days of inventory remained at 88 days.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 372 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 262 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for second quarter ‘21 cash dividend. Bonds payable increased by TWD 20 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 87 billion to TWD 1.2 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.38 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let’s turn now to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 17.6 billion and USD 18.2 billion, which represents a 1.9% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.8, gross margin is expected to be between 56% and 58%, operating margin between 45% and 47%. In addition, we maintain our 2022 capital budget to be between USD 40 million and USD 44 billion. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our first quarter and second quarter profitability. As a reminder, 6 factors determine TSMC’s profitability: leadership, technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. As we discussed earlier, our first quarter gross margin increased by 290 basis points sequentially to 55.6%, mainly due to cost improvement and value-selling efforts and a more favorable foreign exchange rate.
Our gross margin guidance provided 3 months ago was based on exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 27.6, whereas the actual first quarter exchange rate was USD 1 to TWD 27.95. This created about 50 basis point difference in our actual first quarter gross margin versus our original guidance. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to further increase by 140 basis points sequentially to 57% at the midpoint primarily due to a more favorable exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.8, which brings more than 100 basis points gross margin tailwind and continued cost improvement and value-selling efforts.
Looking ahead on our profitability, we continue to face challenges from rising inflationary costs, increasing process complexity of leading nodes, new investments in mature nodes and overseas fab expansions. Despite the manufacturing cost challenges and excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, taking the other 5 factors into consideration, we continue to believe a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 491.1 billion or USD 17.6 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance, mainly due to better demand from smartphone and automotive-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago and customer’s continuing need to ensure supply security with the emergency of COVID-related uncertainties.
Moving into second quarter 2022. We expect our business to be supported by HPC and automotive-related demand, partially offset by smartphone seasonality. On the inventory front, we expect the supply chain to continue to maintain a higher level of inventory as compared to the historical seasonal level for a longer period of time, prolonged by recent COVID-related supply chain disruptions and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tension.
On the demand side, despite the recent macro-related uncertainties, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand, underpinned by the industry makeup trend of 5G and HPC-related applications. This multiyear megatrend will support [markets], the device unit volume growth, and much more importantly, drive substantial semiconductor content enrichment in many young devices across HPC, smartphone, automotive and IoT applications. With our technology leadership, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong structural demand with our advanced and specialty technologies. And we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022.
2022 will be another strong growth year for TSMC. And we expect our full year growth to likely be at or exceed the high end of our guidance range of mid- to high 20s percent in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, given the recent constraint in the tool supply chain, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC worked closely with all our tool suppliers to plan our CapEx and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers are facing great challenges in their supply chain from the continued impact of COVID-19, which are creating labor component and chip constraint in their supply chains and extending towards delivery lead time for both advanced and mature nodes. TSMC is working closely with our suppliers and taking several actions to do our part to [indiscernible] the supply chain challenges. We have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress.
We have sent several teams on-site to support our suppliers and are working closely with them to identify critical chips that are gauging the tool delivery. We are working with our customers to prioritize our wafer capacity to support those critical chips to help mitigate the chip constraint issue. By taking such actions, we do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan, and we continue to work closely with our suppliers on 2023 and beyond so that we can ramp-up our capacity to meet customers’ demand.
Now I will talk about the materials supply update. TSMC operates a well-established enterprise risk management system to identify and access all relevant risk and proactively implement risk mitigation strategies. In terms of material supply, TSMC’s strategy is to continuously develop multi-source supply solutions to build a well-diversified global supplier base and to improve the local supply chain. For specialty chemicals and gases, including neon and geon we source from multiple suppliers in different regions, and we have prepared a certain level of inventory stock on hand. We are also working closely with our suppliers to further strengthen the resilience and the sustainability of our supply chain. Thus, we do not expect any impact on our operations from materials supply.
Finally, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 schedule is unchanged, and we’re on track for volume production in second half of 2022 with good year. We expect the ramp of N3 to be driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tape-outs for N3 for the [first] year as compared with N5 and N7. N3E will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield. We also observed a high level of customer engagement at N3E, and volume production is scheduled for 1 year after N3.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. In terms of profitability, the initial outlook for new node is always challenging. And the increasing process complexity of leading nodes such as the N3 bring even greater challenges to achieving the corporate average gross margin in 7 to 8 quarters, particularly as our corporate profitability has improved with long-term gross margin target of 53% and higher. As we have done at prior nodes, we will continue to work diligently with our cost improvement and reducing our effort to ensure that we earn the right profitability and return on N3. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] Now let’s begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? Yes. The first one to ask question is Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Congratulations for the great result. I think the first one is still focused on the macro and inflation concern. How does TSMC evaluate the impact from the inflation and the geopolitical tension? We understand that TSMC worked with customers closely, but most of your customers probably don’t have the full picture of end demand fluctuation. At the same time, TSMC has beared the risk to build capacity a couple of years ahead to make the decision earlier, so how can TSMC provide more color to strengthen the investor confidence? Do we have any changes on our multiyear capacity expansion plan? Okay. Bruce, please allow me to summarize your first question. I think Bruce’s question is related to the macro environment and inflationary concerns. He wants to know how do we evaluate the impact from inflation and macro environment. And also in terms of our capacity, our customers may not have the full clear picture of end demand but TSMC has to bear the risk of building the capacity multiple years ahead of time. And will the CapEx amplify our volatility, so he wants to know, if there’s any color on what keeps basically management confident for the CapEx plan and color to strengthen investors’ confidence in our CapEx. Bruce, this is C.C. Wei. Let me answer your question. As you said, TSMC works closely with our customers to plain capacity. And our CapEx and capacity expansion plan are actually based on customers’ long-term demand profile, underpinned by the industry megatrend. We do not build capacity based on speculation. In advanced technology node, we have a leading position. In our mature node, our capacity is built to support customer demand for our differentiated specialty technologies. And we focus on building effective capacity, which is capacity that products and produce the specialized technology with high yield rather than just plain capacity. Thus, we are confident our capacity is built to support our customers’ growth, and our utilization and profitability will be sustained. And then also, how do we -- I think the impact of inflation. Well, the inflation definitely impact the consumers’ buying pattern. But let me stress then on overall demand, under the inflation environment, while the momentum in certain end market segment may slow down or adjust in terms of device units, other end market segment remains strong. In fact, we expect our HPC platform to be TSMC’s strongest growing platform in 2022 and the largest contributor to our growth, fueled by the structural megatrend driving increasing need for greater computation power and energy-efficient computing. But then more importantly, the increasing silicon content in end devices such as 5G smartphones, PCs, servers, networking and automotive applications are a much more important factor in supporting our strong semiconductor demand. And with our industry-leading technology, we are well positioned to capture all the opportunities. Okay. Bruce, does that answer your first question? Yes. Okay. I want to go for the second question. I think in the prepared remarks, I noticed that there was no mentioning about the N2 schedule. Both of your competitors accelerated their schedule for the next-generation transistor. Can you comment on TSMC’s status for the [indiscernible] especially in performance and the ramp-up schedule? Okay. So I think Bruce’s second question -- Bruce, please allow me to make sure we got it is on the N2 schedule. He said that our competitors have commented on their N2 schedule, and Bruce wants to know what is our N2 plan? Our N2 development is on track, including new transistor structure and progressing to our expectation. We expect our N2 delivery to be the best technology, maturity, performance and cost for our customers. And we are confident that N2 will continue our technology leadership to support our customer growth. And we still plan the production in 2025. So the 2-year cadence remain unchanged for the N2? It won’t. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? The next one to ask question is Gokul Hariharan from JP Morgan. My first question is on N3. Given we are less than 1 year from N3 mass production start, could we talk a little bit about how should we expect N3 revenues to be ramping up next year? Would it be similar to what we have seen with N5 and N7 with roughly about 10% of next year’s revenues being N3? And also, could you talk -- I think you highlighted that there would be a little bit more challenge to get N3 to profitability closer to corporate average given some of the moving parts. Could we elaborate a little bit more on that as well? That’s my first question. Okay. Gokul, please allow me to summarize your question. So Gokul’s question is really related to N3. He wants to know with the ramp-up of N3 what kind of revenue contribution can we expect. Will it be similar to the past patterns of N5 and N7 for about 10% of wafer revenue in the first year. And also, he would like to ask given C.C.’s comment about process complexity challenges, what is the profitability outlook for N3. Is that correct, Gokul? Okay. Yes. Okay. Maybe Wendell can address. Yes. Gokul, this is Wendell. It’s too early to talk about the revenue contribution as N3 will not begin volume production until second half of 2022 with revenue contribution starting 2023. In addition, as the structural demand underpinned by the industry megatrends is driving growth across all our nodes, the specific percentage of the new nodes as compared to the historical pattern may be less meaningful in the future. But overall, we are confident that our 3-nanometer will be the most advanced foundry technology when it is introduced. And with the strong customer engagement and tape-out activity, our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC, just like N5 and N7 families.
Now about the gross margin, as C.C. said, the initial outlook for new node is always challenging. And the increasing process complexity of leading nodes such as N3 brings even greater challenges to achieving the corporate average gross margin in 7 to 8 quarters, and partially also because our corporate profitability has increased and our new long-term gross margin target of 53% and higher. Now it is a bit early to say when N3 can reach the corporate average gross margin at this stage because the volume production hasn’t started yet. However, we will continue to work diligently on selling our value and cost improvement to ensure that we earn the right profitability and return. Now even considering the increasing process complexity of advanced nodes such as N3, we believe our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and ability to earn our customers’ trust will enable us to earn a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher. Got it. My second question is on the more mature process technologies, could TSMC give us some view on the industry growth for specialty and mature technologies? I think based on the data we look at, historically, that has only grown at maybe low to mid-single digit. But right now, we see a lot of capacity being announced from many foundries in these older specialty and mature process technologies, let’s say, defined as 28-nanometer and above. So could TSMC talk a little bit about growth rate for these mature process technologies going forward? Is it going to be materially higher than the 3% to 5% that we have seen in the past? In most cases, we have seen older nodes grow for 4 to 5 years and then kind of stagnate. Do we see that pattern changing because of some of the content per box or content per device dynamics that you talked about? Yes. Okay. Gokul, let me summarize your second question. I think your second question is -- Gokul’s second question is on the mature node and the outlook -- growth outlook for mature notes. His question is, how do we see the growth outlook at mature nodes? In the past, it has grown, in his words, about 3% to 5%. Do we think it can be materially higher than that on the mature nodes, which he defines as 20-nanometer and above? Okay. Gokul, we forecast the growth rate of the overall semiconductor ex memory industry to accelerate to high single-digit percentage level in the next 5 years as compared to around 4% CAGR in the past 10 years. The higher demand at mature nodes will be driven by structural factors, such as an increase in long-term demand for certain specialty technologies due to the multiyear industry megatrends of 5G and HPC and increasing silicon content in many end devices as well as the acceleration of digitalization. TSMC’s strategy at mature nodes is to work closely with our customers to develop specialty technology solutions to meet their requirements and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. We believe our differentiated specialty technologies will enable us to capture the structural demand generated from the industry megatrends and continue to support our customers’ growth. Gokul, does that answer your second question? Yes. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please? Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Congratulations for the great results, management. My first question is about the semi inventory debate. So may I clarify with C.C. that the company still believe that supply chain need to keep high inventory for several reasons. But in fact, we are seeing that PC, smartphone OEMs, they’re working down channel inventory even, as you know, that the [graphic] they are working down the channel inventory. So do you think that the high inventory is actually a signal of a weaker demand? Or anything that we miss here because, in fact, we are seeing consumer tech inventory, we are seeing a correction? Okay. Charlie, let me summarize your first question. So Charlie’s question is on inventory and end demand. He wants to know or he notes that the consumers -- parts of the consumer end demand seem to be weaker or softer than expected. And so how does this also affect our view on the higher level of inventory, sort of our view? I guess, Charlie, your question is really what is our view on the end demand given potential weakness in consumer end market segments? And then what is our view on inventory. Is that correct? Yes. Yes. And if the demand is indeed deteriorating, do you think the actual inventory level should come down? Charlie, this is C.C. Wei. You are right, some of the end market segment, actually, we start to see a little bit soft in these days for those smartphone, PC or tablets, load. But as I indicated, other end market segment remain very strong, all right? And so if you look at some of the imbalance in the supply chain, particularly in the MCU or the power managed IT side, we still see very strong demand. And also because of those kind of supply chain disruption by the emerging COVID-19 uncertainty, so we are continuing to observe that our customer will maintain a higher level of inventory for a longer period of time. We continue to observe that. And as a result, actually for TSMC, we -- our capacity remain very tight throughout the whole year of 2022. I see. Okay. So is it more specific to those industrial automotive industry inset for consumer tech? Am I right about your comments about inventory level? Yes, you are right. In fact, the very important thing is a structural megatrend. So for the great -- you know that my customer require a greater computation power and energy-efficient computing and which is actually the strong point of TSMC’s technology. I see. And my second question is about your N3 progress. So we continue to hear a lot of good news and anecdotes about your N3E is actually progressing very, very well. So do you think there is a possibility that you could actually pull in your N3E for maybe 1 or 2 quarters to address the customers’ demand, right? So I think it could be a win-win for both TSMC and your customers. Do you see that kind of a possibility and maybe convert some N3 projects to N3E earlier? Okay. So Charlie’s second question is on N3E. He notes the progress is going very well. So his question is, is there a possibility to bring in the timing of N3 to earlier? And will we convert N3 capacity to N3E? Exactly. Okay. Charlie, you are right again. I mean that our N3E result is quite good. And the progress is actually -- is ahead of our schedule. And pull in, yes, we are considering that. So far, I still did not have a very solid data to share with you that how many months we can pull in. But yes, it’s in our plan. And also the capacity, since we have a very strong demand on the N3 and N3E, we are still planning to have enough capacity to support our customer. All right. Thank you, Charlie. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one to ask question is Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse. My first question, I wanted to follow up on your changed outlook where you took up from mid- to high 20s to now high 20s or above. Could you discuss because it is in light of the macro and the softening you’ve seen on consumer? Could you discuss the factors for the change if -- how much might be attributed to market share technology or how much to a certain platform? If you could give an update on your view of the different platforms if certain platform drove it? And did you see any downward change on any of the 4 platforms? Okay. Thank you, Randy. So let me summarize Randy’s first question is about our full year outlook, which as C.C. mentioned in his key messages that we expect to be at -- likely to be at or exceed the high end of our guidance of mid- to high 20s. So Randy’s question is, what is driving the higher or better full year outlook given the macro environment looks a bit more shaky. Is it technology? Is it market share, et cetera? And what is the outlook by platform? Randy, we expect our HPC platform to be TSMC’s strongest growing platform this year and the following years. And it will be the largest contributor to our growth. And this is all because of a structural megatrend driving increasing need for greater computation power and energy-efficient computing. As I said, these kind of technologies happen to be TSMC’s strong point. So that all I can share with you is that we have confidence that it will be exceed or at on the high end of our guidance. Okay. And a follow-up just on the first. Did you change your view on...? Yes, and then also... . Yes, so I wanted to know the other platforms, and if you take your view on [indiscernible]. Now for this year, Randy, we can share with you that we expect HPC and automotive to grow faster than the corporate average. IoT, similar. And smartphone, approaching the corporate average. For the full year. For the full year. Yes. Okay. So it sounds like not much change. My second question is more tied to -- there’s a lot of fear about do we head into the downturn or a slowdown. If you can give the other way in terms of flexibility on expansion plans, if hopefully we don’t, but if we go into a more of a recession, how much flexibility with your fab plants across U.S., Taiwan, Japan and Nanjing? And on the other side, with the prepayment in deposits, is there flexibility on timing of shipments, full flexibility for customers if they need to respond to a slowing demand? Okay. So Randy’s second question is about if there’s a downturn or a slowdown, will this change? Or how flexible is the timeline for our new fab and capacity expansion plans whether in Taiwan, Japan and overseas if the outlook changes for the worse? And what is the flexibility of our prepayments with customers if there was a downturn or slowdown? Randy, this is C.C. Wei. Our CapEx and capacity expansion plan are always based on our customers’ long-term demand profile. This is underpinned by an industry megatrend. As long as the mega trend continues, which we believe it will, we will continue to invest to capture the growth that will follow. So even a short term with the possibility of downturn, which we don’t think it will impact too much to TSMC, if even it happens, we will continue our plan and we have confidence to invest to capture the growth that will follow. Okay. And on the customer side for their -- the deposits and capacity they’re locking in? Randy, actually, we believe signing contracts to guarantee the loading in the future is not a common practice. We focus really on technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and earning customer trust as a more effective way to secure customer commitments. Now we work closely with our customers to plan the capacity, including receiving their prepayments for capacity support. And we will continue to work with them to determine the best way to support them. Yes, Randy. So I think the answer for customer side and capacity side is pretty aligned or similar. Does that answer your second question? Yes. I mean, I guess, just like in the past, it was the flexibility like we saw the slowdown in utilization. So I mean I would think it’s still work with customers on their plans if they need to reschedule because we’ve seen in the past like if they have to adjust their utilization. Like I don’t know if anything’s changed in the model on that element? No, no, nothing changed in the model. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please? Next one is Sunny Lin, UBS. Congratulations on the strong performance. So my first question is on the pricing strategy for you going forward. I mean if we look at this up-cycle, the tight supply and the strong restocking demand has supported pretty meaningful price increase for foundry industry and TSMC throughout 2021. So from here, would you look to further raise price for some of the technologies to justify rising cost of expansion? And on the other hand, if the supply demand start to normalize, do you think there could be any risk to pricing? Okay. So Sunny, let me -- please allow me to summarize your first question. Her question is on pricing on both sides sort of in an up-cycle. But as we face cost challenges, will TSMC consider to further raise the price. And then on the flip side, on the other hand, if demand were to soften, I think, Sunny, you -- on the other hand, was will there be any risk to pricing to lower price. Is that correct? That’s right. Okay. Sunny, this is C.C. Wei. We do not comment on our pricing detail. But let me assure you that our pricing strategy is strategic, not opportunistic or short term. And customer understands our effort to support their growth. As you said that if there is a downturn coming and on the flip side, the TSMC going to drop our price, the answer is no. Did I answer your question? That’s very helpful. So my second question is to follow up on the N3 ramp-up. So just trying to get a bit of a color on 2023. I understand the demand is pretty robust. But when we think about the potential revenue contribution for 2023, with the less equipment supply and delivery time, would that be a capping factor for 3-nanometer to exceed the typical 10% revenue contribution for next year? Or do you think there’s still some time for you to try to accelerate the equipment expansion? Okay. So, Sunny’s second question is on N3 and the ramp-up. Her question once again is sort of around the revenue contribution of N3. And specifically, she is asking whether the equipment supply or some of the tool delivery issues would affect the ramp-up of N3 in next 2023 and, thus, the revenue contribution. Well, we did see some of the issues on the tool delivery and we are still working on it. As I said in the statement, we are working on 2023 right now, and we hope that we won’t have any big issue. But right now, we are not ready yet to share with you that how much we can resolve the issue. But we have strong demand. We try to build enough capacity for our customers. And we are working with our equipment supplier to get enough tool to expand our capacity. Okay. Thank you, Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one to ask questions, Rick Hsu from Daiwa. Yes. My first question is regarding [about] your revenue guidance for this year. I think you think that it should be at or even exceed your mid- to high 20s guidance in U.S. dollar terms. So in that case, are you revising your forecast for the global semiconductor ex memory for this year and also the global foundry market forecast for this year? Okay. Rick’s first question is about our 2022 outlook. Sorry, Rick, let me try to summarize. So Rick notes that C.C. said, our 2022 growth will likely be at or exceed the high end of our revenue guidance of mid- to high 20s. So he wants to know what does this mean for our forecast or expectation for the semiconductor ex memory and foundry markets. So let me answer your question. So far, we are confident on TSMC’s performance. But the whole industry, semiconductor’s foundry industry remain that it will be around 20% year-over-year as a growth. All others, we are still trying to understand the status and not very ready to share with you yet. Okay. So basically, the strength is more TSMC company specific, right? That’s because our dealership in the technology, and you are right. Okay, great. C.C., and second question, I think your customers have been waiting in the long queue since last year. And I know this year, there’s some macro issues, there’s some change and you mentioned some demand slowdown. But some others still very strong. So I assume for any customers releasing capacity will be quickly filled up by others. But are you saying the queue is shortening? Or if that’s the case, when do you think the queue -- there’s no more queue? When do you think that will happen? Okay. So Rick’s second question is about the -- C.C. mentioned that our capacity will remain tight throughout 2022. But C.C.’s -- sorry, Rick’s question is more about the queue or the line to wait because, as we said, certain end market segments may slow down or adjust, but others remain strong. Rick’s question is really is that wait or list line shortening, or when do we expect that to shorten? Rick, so far, as I said, TSMC’s capacity will be very tight, not enough to support our customers. So if you ask whether the list in the queue will be longer was smaller, it doesn’t matter. It’s still just not enough to support our customers. And we are working very hard to support them. That’s what I can share with you. Okay. Thank you, Rick. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one online Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Yes. I had a question on your overseas fab expansion plans. I guess today, if we look at your wafer capacity, it’s 100% in Taiwan. Are you seeing any pressure from your strategic customers to accelerate your overseas plans for fab expansion? And can you also share with us if you have a target for what portion of your wafer capacity long term might come from your overseas fabs? And in what time period might that happen? Okay. So Brett’s first question is about our overseas expansion and global manufacturing footprint. His question is that, are we seeing any pressure from strategic customers to expand overseas? And he wants to know what proportion or percentage of our capacity will be overseas by what time frame? Okay. Let me answer the question. In fact, talking about the overseas supply or the capacity we are building, our responsibility as TSMC’s management is to make the best decision for our customers and in the best interest of TSMC. And we are in close and constant communication with all of our customers. And so far, actually, their priority are securing capacity, enough capacity to support their business and also working with TSMC on technology development. That’s TSMC to focus on.
And for the how much of the capacity to build out site, let me share with you, right now, we have fab in Arizona with 5-nanometer, a fab in Japan which are 28 and 16 FinFET technology and expanding our capacity in China with 16 FinFET and 28. Also, we’re building in Taiwan for 28 nanometers more capacity. We definitely have some future plan, but while increase in the next several years, but not enough to share with you say how many percentage in total were compared with TSMC’s technology. Does that answer your question? Yes, that’s great. And maybe just a second question. On -- you mentioned N3E is coming 1 year after N3. But you can give us an update around timing of 2-nanometer, which I believe is going to have a new transistor architecture gate all around. I guess the move from N5 to N3 was more than 2 years, which is what you’ve typically been -- that cadence you’ve typically been running at. Are we going to get back to 2 years with N2, between N3 and N2, so that we’ll see an end of 2024 introduction for N2? Or will it take longer? Okay. So Brett’s second question is really on N2 and the cadence. He wants to know that N5 to N3 is about more than 2 years cadence between those 2 nodes. For N3 to N2, will it be back on a 2-year cadence? And what’s the time frame for N2? Brett, our progress so far today for the N2 is on track. And all I want to say is, yes, at the end of 2024, you will enter the risk production. 2025, it will be in production, probably close to the second half or the -- or the end of 2025. That’s our schedule. All right. Thank you, Brett. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one, we have Laura Chen, KGI. My first question is about the advanced packaging development. Can you share with us your view on TSMC’s current progress in advanced packaging in terms of the revenue contribution and the growth trend? And since we know that there are a lot of high computing PC clients relied on TSMC advanced packaging or 3D packaging service, so can we expect your advanced packaging revenue will be kind of part of your high computing PC growth outlook? That’s my first question. Okay. So Laura’s first question is on our 3D IC or advanced packaging progress. She wants to know the progress in terms of the revenue contribution, the growth outlook for the packaging business and how correlated is it to the high HPC platform. Right. Lauren, let me answer the first part. In 2021, the advanced packaging generated $4.1 billion of revenue. Now we expect that this year, the growth will be similar to the corporate growth. And during the 5-year -- in the next 5 years, we expect its growth in CAGR will be slightly higher than the corporate. And the correlation with HPC? Well, let me answer that correlation. Actually, very advanced SoICs technology actually serve for the HPC high-end applications. So that required high bandwidth and very low power and very high performance. And so far, we just entered a small volume of the production in 2022 and we expect this one will continue to grow. That’s what we have today. Okay. That’s very clear. And my second question is more like a follow-up. I think C.C. already mentioned a lot about the strategy of the CapEx expansion in longer term. But we know that the equipment lead timeline has been quite longer. So I’m just wondering any specific area or process you are seeing the biggest impact? And what’s your action accordingly? Or do you have any priorities for various technology nodes? Okay. So Laura’s second question is about capacity expansion and equipment lead time. Given the tool delivery that C.C. talked about, she wants to know what areas or nodes are we seeing the biggest impact? And are we prioritizing -- how are we prioritizing this? Laura, I mean that’s -- we see this kind of tool delivery problem unexpectedly from beginning of this year. And we are working very hard with our tool suppliers to resolve all the issues. And so as for which technology node or which technology or what are being impacted, all the leading-edge technology and mature node technologies capacity expansion are being impacted. And certainly, in order to support our customers’ strong demand, we’re working very hard for the tool suppliers to resolve all the issues. And so far, 2022, no problem. We’re working on 2023 and beyond. I hope a few months later that we can report that the issue will be resolved. But we’re still working very hard with our suppliers and to resolve all the issue. That’s all I can say right now. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one to ask questions, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Yes. My first one has to do with better understanding demand dynamics. You highlighted better than average growth from HPC. And in that context, I’m just wondering how I should think about the mix of 5 and 7-nanometer node by year-end ‘22 or second half of ‘22? Okay. So Mehdi’s first question is looking at the demand and also by node, he wants to know how should he expect the contribution or the mix from N5 and N7 in the second half of this year. It will be greater than we just reported of 50%, right? I mean for the second half of this year, the contribution to TSMC’s revenue were greater than 50%, combining 7 and 5 together. Okay. I was just trying to better understand how that increase would look like compared to prior years where in the second half, usually the advanced node contribution increases and with the leap in [indiscernible] mix. I was just trying to better understand how the second half of ‘22 will look like in the past prior years. Yes. Mehdi, I think that the second half revenue is normally higher partially because of seasonality of some of the products. Okay. Great. And one more follow-up. And thank you so much for the color on the next technology migration of 2-nanometer. You highlighted the transistor change. But I also want to understand what is underlying assumption, especially as it relates to lithography. We also have another change coming up as going from EUV to high NA. And I’m just curious to know if you are assuming if you will be using EUV, or you would need high NA as you go into HBM for 2-nanometer in the second half of ‘25? Okay. So Mehdi’s second question is on N2, a very specific question. He wants to know with N2, there’s a change in transistor structure. He also wants to know on the lithography side, will we be using EUV or high NA, correct, Mehdi? Yes. Well, let me answer the question. We are the largest user of EUV tool today in the industry. And so we have intensively evaluated and are very familiar with those high-end EUV tools for wire. And we will continue to evaluate and adopt the high-end tool whenever we think is necessary and is ready and cost effective. Whether it is a N2 or not, I have not yet to be able to share with you. Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. Operator, can we move on to the next participant? Next one to ask questions, Charles Shi from Needham & Company. I want to ask my first question a little bit longer term. One of your IDM customers, well, I don’t want to call the name. But their CEO, I believe, revisited you twice over the last 6 months. They think they can both buy wafers from you and, at the same time, compete with your technology. And they are hoping in 2025 and beyond, we’ll compete with you in the foundry business. So there has been concerns that you may not really get a fair deal out of this a little bit of complex relationship. One concern, very specifically, I heard this that you may end up basically teaching this competitor, enabling their accelerated road map. But in the end, they will break away from you and compete against you, especially in the foundry business. So maybe can you address this concern and provide us some high-level thinking to the investor community and the public? Okay. Charles, let me summarize your first question. His first question is on the IDM customer that wants to buy wafers or outsource to TSMC, but also said that they would like to compete in the foundry industry. So Charles, your question is really, I guess, 2 parts in the sense that how will TSMC end up teaching this IDM and enabling the road map? And how will we compete on the foundry side? Well, Charles, let me answer the question first on the competition. As a leading pure-play foundry, TSMC have never been short on competition in our 35-year history. And we know how to compete, all right? And you asked about how to protect the TSMC’s IP or technology detail. In fact, we have a well-established process and design enablement system to ensure a productive engagement with all our customers and while we can protect our own IP as well as customers’ IP. We do not anticipate any issues at all. And for the future, actually, these are IDM -- I take back, they are business back into their own house. We have already taken this into our capacity planning consideration already. Did I answer your question, Charles? Yes. C.C., so maybe really just to follow up, the second question and then actually is a follow-up to my first question. There has been some press reports, I believe, over the last 2, 3 months saying TSMC is building -- potentially building a dedicated fab for this particular customer. I’m not sure if dedicated fab or production line for specific customers is really TSMC’s standard practice. However, can you kind of provide your thinking? Would the answer be no, even if like this customer is going to bring you a significant volume? Okay. So Charles’ second question is there’s been certain media reports saying that we will build a decade fab or production for certain IDM. Is this our practice? Or -- and would the answer still be no even if there is large volume behind such a dedicated capacity? Well, Charles, to be frank with you, our capacity planning, as we said many times, is based on the long-term market demand profile, underpinned by the industry’s megatrend of 5G and SPC and the semiconductor content enrichment in many young devices. We are not dependent on any single customer or product. Did I answer your question? Yes. Okay. Thank you, Charles. Operator, in the interest of time, I think we’ll take the last 2 participants’ questions, please. Okay. And the next one to ask question is Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. I had 2 of them. The first one is for Wendell. In the March quarter, there’s quite a big difference between the revenue growth and the shipment growth. So I’m kind of curious on your full year guidance of high 20s or even beyond that for revenue growth, how much is coming from pricing? Any color there would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up for C.C. Okay. So, Krish’s first question is in looking at our full year outlook. He wants to know how much of our growth this year, how much of it is coming from price versus volume, I guess? Yes. Krish, volume, price and product mix are important contributing factors in driving our growth. But we do not have a specific breakdown to share with you. All right. No worries. And then I had a follow-up for C.C. Clearly, investors seem to be worried about a recession or a slowdown. So C.C. from your experience, when you look at price cyclical slowdowns or even macro corrections, what are the leading indicators TSMC looks for specifically? Is it a pricing slowdown? Is it pushed out of capacity? Is it customers breaking LTAs? What do you think is the first shoe to drop? Any color there would be helpful. Okay. Krish’s second question is in terms of looking at, again, the demand environment. He wants to ask C.C. and based on past recessions or slowdowns, what are some of the leading indicators that we watch for to -- as a signal? Do we look at pricing slowdown? Do we look at slowdown in capacity and CapEx? What are the indicators that we look at? Krish, this is a tough question to be asked because we always in close working with our customers. So we know that each customer’s demand and their forecast and we plan our capacity, we plan our technology by working with them. So if there is a downturn, sure, we’ve got the firsthand information from our customers. And we collect them together, and we do get it. And we decide our long-term CapEx and capacity. But which one is a leading indicator, that, I don’t have a specific answer for your questions. Okay. Thank you. Operator, we’ll take the questions from the last participant, please then. Thank you. Yes. The last one to ask question is Rolf Bulk from New Street Research. At the beginning of the year, you guided for advanced processes to account for 70% to 80% of CapEx and specialty nodes for 20%. Now with the year now underway and you’re having better visibility on the demand in your different end markets, can you share with us if you’re thinking on capacity additions of advanced versus specialty have changed? Or whether those ratios that you gave originally still hold? Okay. Rolf’s first question is about our CapEx and CapEx spending. His question is with the -- in the past 3 months, has the allocation or breakdown between events and specialty technologies in terms of our CapEx, has that changed? No, no, it has not. That’s helpful. Now as a follow-up, you mentioned that you’re working with suppliers to secure and further diversify your material supply. Can you discuss whether you expect your material input cost increase in the second half of the year? And how we should think about gross margin in the second half of 2022 in that context? Okay. So Rolf’s second question is a little bit on materials cost. We have said that we’re diversifying our material supplier. So are we seeing the input cost increase? And then what does this mean for the margin outlook in the second half? Yes. Well, let me answer that. Yes, we do face manufacturing cost challenges, partially due to the rising materials inflationary cost. But we always work closely with our customers to provide our value. And we will continue to ensure that the pricing strategy reflects the value creation. We will also work diligently in our fab operations and with our suppliers to deliver on cost improvements. So by taking such actions, we believe we can achieve the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and earn greater than 25% ROE through the cycle. That will enable us to invest to support our customers’ growth and to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. Okay. Rolf, does that answer? Very helpful. Yes. Thank you, Rolf. Okay. So thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today’s conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 1 hour from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC’s website at www.tsmc.com.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode.
The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2022, followed by our guidance for the third quarter 2022. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will host the Q&A session, where all three executives will entertain your questions.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter.
Second quarter revenue increased 8.8% sequentially in NT or 3.4% in U.S. dollars, as our second quarter business was supported by strong HPC, IoT and automotive-related demand. Second quarter gross margin increased 3.5 percentage points sequentially to 59.1%, slightly ahead of our guidance, as we enjoyed a more favorable foreign exchange rate, cost improvement and value selling.
Likewise, operating margin increased 3.5 percentage points sequentially to 49.1%, in line with our gross margin increase. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 9.14 and ROE was 39.4%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 21% of wafer revenue in the second quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 30%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. All six platforms increased in the second quarter. Smartphone increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 38% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 13% to account for 43%. IoT increased 14% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 14% to account for 5%. And digital consumer electronics increased 5% to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.4 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 22 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 47 billion in accounts payable, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 29 billion in short-term loans. Long-term interest-bearing debts increased by TWD 124 billion, mainly as we raised TWD 109 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased one day to 37 days while days of inventory increased seven days to 95 days as we prebuild M5 wafers and increased raw materials inventory.
Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 339 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 218 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for third quarter '21 cash dividend. Bonds payable increased by TWD 109 billion as a result of this quarter's bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased by TWD 102 billion to TWD 1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled $7.34 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between $19.8 billion and $20.6 billion, which represents a 11.2% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 29.7, gross margin is expected to be between 57.5% and 59.5%, operating margin between 47% and 49%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our second quarter and third quarter profitability. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp up, pricing, cost, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate.
Compared to first quarter, our second quarter gross margin increased by 350 basis points sequentially to 59.1%, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate, cost improvement and value selling. Compared to our second quarter guidance, our actual gross margins exceeded the high end of the range provided 3-month ago as our guidance was based on exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 28.8 whereas the actual second quarter exchange rate was $1 to TWD 29.42. This created about 90 basis point difference in our actual second quarter gross margin versus our original guidance.
We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline 60 basis points sequentially to 58.5% at the midpoint, as a slightly more favorable exchange rate assumption will be more than offset by higher inflationary costs, including higher raw material and electricity costs.
Looking ahead on our profitability, we will face challenges from rising inflationary costs from raw materials, utilities and tools, increasing process complexity of leading nodes, new investments in mature nodes and overseas fab expansions. Despite the manufacturing cost challenges, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, taking the other 5 factors into consideration, we continue to believe a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our effective tax rate. For 2022, we expect our tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. Starting in 2023, we will see the expiration of certain tax exemptions in Taiwan, and our effective tax rate will increase. However, Taiwan government is in the process of drafting certain new tax exemption regulations and is currently in the common period. Therefore, we will provide a further update on the outlook of our tax rate in 2023 and beyond when more details become available.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
First, let me start with our near-term growth outlook. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of TWD 534 billion or $18.2 billion, supported by HPC, IoT and automotive-related demand. Moving into third quarter 2022, we expect our business to be supported by continued demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies.
On the inventory side, due to the softening device momentum in smartphone, PC and consumer end market segments, we observe the supply chain is already taking action and expect inventory level to reduce throughout the second half 2022. After two years of pandemic-driven stay to home demand, and this type of adjustment is reasonable, in our view. Our expectation is for the excess inventory in the semiconductor supply chain to take a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level. We believe the current semiconductor cycle will be more similar to a typical cycle, with a few quarters of inventory adjustment likely through first half 2023. We have also internally modeled and prepared ourselves for various different scenarios in case it is necessary.
On the demand side, while we observe softness in consumer end market segment, the end market segments such as data center and automotive-related remains steady. And we are able to reallocate our capacity to support these areas. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continues to exceed our ability to supply. We expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 and our full year growth to be mid-30% in U.S. dollar terms.
Three key factor in supporting TSMC's strong structural demand are our technology leadership and differentiation, our strong portfolio in high-performance computing and our strategic relationship with customers. All of these factors are TSMC's strength in the foundry industry.
First, on technology leadership and differentiation, TSMC's technology position is much stronger today as compared to previous years. Looking ahead to 2023, we are working diligently to provide the industry most advanced technologies and making it available to all the product innovators with the successful ramp of N5, N4P, N4X and the upcoming ramp-up of N3, we will expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. The macroeconomic uncertainty may persist into 2023. Our technology leadership will continue to advance and support our growth.
Secondly, the massive structural increase in the demand of computation, underpinned by the industry megatrend, continues to fill greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require use of leading-edge technologies. Through our comprehensive IP ecosystem and optimized process technology, we are able to address and capture the structural demand and build a strong portfolio in high-performance computing. We expect HPC to be the main engine of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth in the next several years.
Third, our strategic relationship with our customers are long-term in nature, developed and built through many years of collaboration and investment to enable customers' success in the high-end market. We continue to work closely with our customer and technology development, capacity planning and pricing to support their long-term demand and growth.
With all these three differentiating factors, we expect our capacity utilization to remain healthy in 2023. And our business to be less volatile and more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies.
Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe silicon content increase across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing.
5G smartphone carries substantially higher silicon content as compared to 4G smartphone. The amount of silicon content in today's car continue to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics device may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range, in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand.
TSMC's CapEx and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors. We are working closely with our customer to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook.
With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support and customers trust, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong multiyear growth from the favorable structural megatrend of 5G and HPC related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC work closely with all our tool supplier to plan our CapEx and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes. As a result, we expect some of our CapEx this year to be pushed out into 2023.
TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery. We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues.
While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity. We have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand.
Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year, fiscal year. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications.
We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, let me talk about the N2 status. Our N2 technology development is on track and progressing well to our expectation, with risk production schedule in 2024 and volume production in 2025. After careful evaluation and extensive period of development, our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the narrow sea transistor structure to provide our customers with the best performance, cost and technology maturity.
N2 deliver full node performance and power benefited to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing, with 10 to 15 speed improvement at the same power or 20% to 30% power improvement at the same speed and larger density of more than 20% increase as compared with N3E. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy-efficient when it is introduced and will further extend our leadership position well into the future.
This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Now let's begin the Q&A session. Our Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will be the host. Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming to this conference. I wish you all healthy and well. I think the -- we hope the above reports already answered some of your question, but it definitely shows we -- this company stands on firm ground. And we will be prepared prudently going through this near-term uncertainty. In the meantime, we will be also confident and well prepared for our next growth period.
So now the floor is open for your question. Thank you, Chairman. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line. The first one to ask question, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. Thank you. Congratulations on the good outlook. My first question, I wanted to ask on your view on the business cycle. You raised your outlook to 35% in the strong third quarter. Could -- with that strong outlook, I wanted to see what is driving your expectation for inventory drawdown in second half? And how broad you're seeing the inventory drawdown? And the follow-up question I wanted to ask to that is, what is your view on the first half? With your view customers will be drawing down through the first half, do you see underutilization? And how severe do you expect that correction? Okay. Randy, please allow me to summarize your first question. So I think, Randy, the first part -- his first question is in looking at TSMC's third quarter guidance and also looking at our full year growth to be mid-30s. He's wondering, I believe, Randy, how to reconcile this with our expectation of the inventory adjustment in the second half and also into the first half next year. So how do we reconcile our view on the inventory cycle against our own business? Is that correct, Randy? Yes. That's correct. Just an initial view on first half. How much correction you're aiming for in your business? Randy, this is C.C. Wei. Let me answer your question. Yes, we do have mid-30s growth in this year. But we also expect our customers start to take action to decrease their inventory level. How far? We expect that a few quarters, at least into the first half of 2023, they will continue to do the inventory correction. And the awarded to TSMC's evaluation, let me say that despite ongoing inventory adjustment and macro uncertainties, the structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remained firm. With our leading and differentiated advance and specialty technologies and a strong HPC portfolio and strategic customer relationships, we expect our capacity remain tight and our business to be more resilient. And we are confident in both our near-term and long-term growth outlook. Did that answer your question? Yes. I mean, to clarify, do you expect even through first half to remain tight, factoring in your tech position and some of the projects you have? Yes. You remain. So I think Randy wants to ask, in the first half of next year, do we expect -- how do we see our capacity utilization given the ongoing inventory adjustment? I cannot give you exactly the number that we are talking about, but let me say, it's hearsay. Okay. Okay. Great. My second question, on the CapEx, two parts. Just want to understand the push-outs, a little more what it's affecting the 3-nanometer. How much ramp the 5-nanometer or mature nodes? And if you could also discuss the framework for next year's CapEx. I think you've made comments about we could be above TWD 40 billion. If you could give a framework for how you're thinking about next year CapEx. Okay. So Randy's second question is on the CapEx. He wants to know, with some of the tool delivery issues, the CapEx pushout, is this more for 3-nanometer? Is this for 5-nanometer? Or is this more on the mature node side? And he also wants to know how does this impact our CapEx for 2023. As we said before, that 2023 could be TWD 40 billion or higher. Okay. Randy, this is Wendell. The first question, as C.C. said in his prepared remarks that the schedule, the tool delivery schedule changes currently as in both the advance and the mature nodes. Okay. And your second question is about next year's CapEx. It's too early to talk about next year's CapEx. But as we always said, we invest the CapEx in the year for the future opportunities. So as long as the outlook, the future outlook is good, we will continue to invest, but of course, in a disciplined manner. Okay. And just for this year, with the pushout, what's your expectation for how much this year would be? And that's my final question. Thank you. I think next year will be too early. But I can tell you that this year, it will be closer to the lower end of our previous guidance. So closer to the lower end of the guidance of TWD 40 billion to TWD 44 billion, Randy.
Okay. Great, thank you. Operator can we move onto the next participant please. Next one to ask questions is Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the great result. I think I may say that the next few years, the revenue growth will still at the 15% to 20% growth, and it is driven by the compound -- dollar content growth. Can you -- this is actually the most difficult part for the investor or the biggest discrepancy when we talk to the investor, how much is driven by the dollar content growth? Because investors do not really see the die fab side [ph]. So for example, by 50% to 20% growth for the next few years, how much is driven by dollar content growth? How much is driven by shipment? Or how much driven by the ASP or product mix improvement? Okay. Let me -- Bruce, thank you. Let me summarize your first question. So Bruce is really looking at our long-term growth. We said that between -- we will grow between 15% to 20% CAGR in the next several years. He wants to know, out of this 15% to 20%, how much is driven by silicon content? How much is driven by, Bruce, I think you said shipment? How much is driven by ASP? Bruce, let me answer the question. But exactly the number, I cannot share with you because it's confidential. But let me say that. The content increase actually is at least mid- to high single digit for our edge devices. And then even all the electronics devices, even the growth is flattish or some kind of a low single-digit. It's still growing. It’s still growing. And combined with all these and our value selling with our customer, so we are confident to say 15% to 20% CAGR is achievable. Okay. Okay, thank you. So to my next question is for the mature node and the specialty capacity expansion. I think Chairman recently commented that you will expand your mature node that specialized capacity by 50%, 50, in the next three years. I mean, this number looks a bit big. I mean can you tell us how do you achieve this 50% capacity expansion by the new capacity or conversion? And where are those demand? How do you see the mature node supply and the demand in the coming few years? Okay. Bruce, let me summarize your second question, please. All right. So Bruce's second question is on mature node and specialty capacity expansion. He is looking to say TSMC expanding our mature node specialty capacity by 50%. That looks very big. Is that all new capacity expansion? Is some of this also coming from logic conversion to specialty? And then also, what applications are driving this? Well, let me answer the question. 50% increase, we mean that 50% is in specialty technologies capacity. It doesn't mean the overall capacity increase. Okay. We did this because of our customers' need, and we work closely to support the growth. So it's not a 50% increase in the logic capacity, no. it's specialties. And if I may add a little bit. The expansion also includes both the new capacity and conversion of existing capacity. So how confident you are, I mean, in terms of this kind of capacity expansion, what kind of application which will keep you confident for this kind of increase? So because in the past like 20 years, your capacity expansion is mostly in the advanced node? So Bruce wants to know what is keeping TSMC confident to have such expansion on the specialty technologies as most of our expansion in the past has been focused on the advanced nodes. Bruce, you are right. In the past years, TSMC always increased the leading-edge capacity. We did not increase any specialties in the past few years, except a few upgrade from logical to specialty. But this time, it's different. First, because we can see the silicon content continue to increase on all the edge devices. It's not -- it's included on the demand on the leading-edge capacity. It also requires the specialties content inside. And so at the urge of our customers' request, TSMC closely work with our customer and to expand our specialty capacities. Okay.
How confident? Very, very confident. I believe. So, thank you. Thank you, Bruce. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask question, Sunny Lin from UBS. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results. So my first question is on the semi cycle earlier, that you have done some scenario analysis on the semi cycle for 2023. So I just wonder what your current base case for semi growth for 2023. Do you think it will be like a typical down cycle like in 2015, 2019? Or would it be a more meaningful correction? Thank you. Okay. Sunny, thank you. Sunny's first question is on the semiconductor cycle. She wants to know what is TSMC's base case for 2023. Do we think it will be more of a typical cycle such as in 2015 or 2019? Or it will be more of a meaningful correction, I believe, are her words. Yes. Sunny, yes, our base case is a typical -- more of a typical down cycle. The inventory correction maybe go for a few quarters, through the first half of 2023. It's not like a big down cycle back in 2008 or something like that. Got it. Thank you. And so my second question is on 3-nanometer. As we are ramping up the technology in second half, how should we think about the revenue contribution into 2023? In terms of profitability, will the 3-nanometer ramp-up have any impact into Q4 or if the impact will be mostly from Q1 next year? Okay. And so thank you, Sunny. So Sunny's second question is on 3-nanometer. With the ramp, she wants to know what type of revenue contribution from N3 in 2023. And also, with the ramp of N3, what would be the impact to profitability? When should we see it? And what type of impact from N3. Thank you. That's correct. Right, Sunny? That's right. Thank you, Jeff. Sure. Okay, Sunny. In terms of revenue contribution from N3, I have to say that nowadays, it's less meaningful to talk about the revenue contribution of a leading node at the very beginning when we start to ramp it compared to the -- in the past because the total pie is increasing and we believe it will continue to increase. Dollar amount-wise, it's certainly bigger than the previous nodes at the very beginning stage. This is your first question. In terms of profitability dilution, we expect that it will impact between 2 to 3 percentage points in gross margins in 20 -- in the first year, 2023. Thank you. Got it. Thank you. That’s very clear. Thank you very much. Thank you, Sunny. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please. Now let's turn for Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Gokul, are you on the line. You might have to unmute. Sorry. My first question is on the... Gokul, sorry, you're breaking up. Can you try again? Repeat your question, please. Yes. Sure. My first question, inventory cycle. Gokul, so sorry. Okay. Let's try one more time because you continue to break up. Let's try one more time. If not, I will have to ask you to dial back in. Sorry. Please repeat your question again. Sure. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. My first is investor's impact. Could you talk to what is your expectation? Okay. Gokul, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your line is very unstable. So I will ask you to please try to get back into the queue, and we'll address your question. Okay? Operator can we move on to the next caller please. Apologize for that. Next one to ask question, Brett Simpson, Arete Research. Yes, thanks very much. I had a question on the inventory burden off that you were signaling potentially for first half '23. Can you talk more broadly about fabless days of inventory today and how you see this trending in the second half of the year? And then in terms of your outlook for the overall semi industry, what is your current view for 2022 growth and 2023 growth? And has your view changed in the last three months? Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Brett. So Brett's first question is looking at inventory and the overall industry. So his first question is about the inventory adjustment. We have said that it will likely be through first half 2023. So what do we see for the fabless DOI trending in second half of this year? Yes. Yes, Brett. We expect the fabless DOI to come down in the second half of the year gradually. And your second question? Come down throughout second half of this year. Correct. Yes, yes. And then the second part of this question is -- Brett, sorry, again, your second part is looking at the industry, what is our current view on the semiconductor industry for 2022 and 2023? And how has our forecast changed or not? That's right. Well, let me answer the question. Our forecast for the semiconductor exclude memory and the forecast on the foundry growth in 2022 remain the same as we projected earlier. For 2023, it's too early to forecast. But as we said, the inventory correction will continue to go on. And for TSMC, because our technology position is much stronger today and we also have a very strong portfolio in HPC and we have a long-term strategic relationship with customer, so we see 2023, even just inventory correction, is still a growth year for TSMC. Okay. Jeff, can I just have a second question? Is that possible? Sure. One more second question. Yes. So we've been hearing from some other leading-edge chip manufacturers that they are looking at the opportunity to work with project financing companies when it comes to new fab builds. I think companies like Brookfield has been mentioned. How does TSMC view this trend? And is there a fab rental model or a way to reduce the free cash flow burden in this industry as you bring on new fabs? Thank you. All right. So Brett second question is, he wants to know what is TSMC's view. His observation is other companies in the industry are using project financing to build new fabs, this new fab rental model. So what is TSMC's view on this? Brett, we are not considering project financing now. Normally, project financing entails stringent, stricter terms and higher costs. We will finance the expansion mainly from our operating cash flow and borrowing using our strong balance sheet. That's our current policy. Right. Thank you. Alright operator, let’s move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley Hello, good afternoon. And also, congratulations for great results. So my first question is about your HPC and smartphone demand, because our view is that the macro slowdown or recession should impact the core CapEx and the consumption. So management, do you think that the so-called inventory digestion will sooner later apply to your data center same customers and the high-end smartphone customers order in the coming quarters? Thank you. Okay. So Charlie's first question is looking at the inventory adjustment in light of the macro slowdown. He wants to know, do we believe or see impact to cloud service provider CapEx or high-end smartphone sort of to have inventory adjustment next? Is that correct, Charlie? Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Charlie, this is C.C. Wei. I think to answer your question, you might think they have too much of inventory in the HPC area. But as we said, that in our life, there are so many edge devices continue to create data. And those data need to be processed. And with sufficient speed and efficient power consumption, and that require our leading-edge technology to provide the solution. So even the inventory correction or something like that, we expect our business to be less volatile and more resilience through the near-term uncertainties. And also, we are highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. Yes, yes. So how about the high-end smartphone inventory correction? Do you expect that top brand inventory -- smartphone inventory to see correction as well on the semiconductor demand? Thank you. So Charlie also wants to know, do we expect high-end smartphone inventory correction on the semi demand? To be frank with you, we did not see too much of inventory on the high-end smartphone buildup. So no. Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And my second question is about your future technology demand installment. So either Mark or C.C., can you please help me. So this is the first time you've disclosed the N2 DAA large density improvement. I think more than 20% large density increase still better than market share. But compared to the previous node, there's a significant slowdown. So do you think -- first of all, N2 is a full node migration.
And do you think that there is a kind of a significant slowdown of more slow? And what does that mean to your CapEx per k for N2 versus N3? And lastly, backside power via. So I'm very interested in your kind of N2, what it means to your long-term technology and also CapEx. Thank you. Okay. Maybe I'll summarize Charlie's second question into through different parts. His first question is on N2 Technology. And he notes that the logic density gain is more than 20%. But does this represent a significant slowdown, especially in the context of Moore's Law? And what does this mean for technology as a whole? Maybe Chairman can address. Let me answer your question. First of all, C.C. just mentioned, our N2 will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry when it is introduced, because this technology, we work closely with our customers, and about -- regarding the scaling factor included. But Charlie, we -- from now on, we have to look at the technology in a platform fashion. The N2 technology is not just the wafer scaling.
The N2 technology include transistor scaling, but also include the new power line structure and also include a new chiplet technology to allow the more architectural innovation in our customers. So this is a whole set of technology offering composed to be N2 nanometer. The scaling factor is smaller, but we really know the customers' needs is -- today is really about the power efficiency. And this will be a full node power efficiency migration. And to control the cost, that is the reason we control the scaling factor while maintain the same value for the new generation of technology. So that's my report, yes. Great. And also Charlie is asking about the backside power on N2. Okay. Let me add some viewpoint. On the backside power delivery, actually, we call the super power rail is part of our N2 platform offering. And at the proper time, who are introduced to the market whenever our customer need it. Yes. So if you put that together, right, it seems like lower -- you have this power via -- what does that mean to your CapEx burden in the coming years? Thank you very much. Yes. Okay, thank you, Charlie. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Laura Chen [ph 0:51:09] from KGI Group. Thank you for taking my questions. And congrats for the good result. My first question is about your view on the key applications. Actually, starting from the last quarter, we already see that high computing PC has been the key categories for TSMC. So I'm just wondering your view from various architecture, like on base or X86, can we share with our view that what will be the key driver for TSMC for the next few years?
Do you see that will more from the on-base CPU or more upside from the X86? And also, on the smartphone space, I recall that in the previous analyst call, you mentioned that penetration rate for the on 5G, you expect there will be about like 50%. But given the weak demand growth, well, what's your latest view on the 5G smartphone penetration? That's my first question. Thanks. Okay. So Laura's first question. First, she wants to know on HPC. She notes HPC has become the largest contributor by platform to our revenue. So she wants to know what -- when we look out over the next several years, how do we see HPC? Is this driven by ARM-based or versus x86. I think that's the first part of her first question. Laura, our HPC definitely is growing here. And since TSMC, everybody's foundry. So we support both X86 and ARM based for what you say for the high-performance computing, both. And both are significantly growing in TSMC. And then she also wants to -- sorry? Yes. It seems like TSMC already has a very high exposure on the ARM base. So can we expect the next few years still a growth driver to more come from the X86? Can I answer this question? We have very high exposure to X86 also. But Laura, I think we have said numerous times and it still remains holds true that HPC will be the largest contributor and increasingly the main driver of TSMC's growth over the next several years. Yes. And Laura, your second question is the 5G smartphone penetration rate. We're still working at about 50% at this moment. Okay, thank you. And if I can add the second question about the gross margin outlook. I think 59% is really amazing. And considering your CapEx discipline and the consistent delivery in advanced node or maybe price hike as well, can we expect that will have more upside to your current 53% gross margin target? So Laura’s, second question is on the gross margin. She notes that gross margin for second quarter, 59.1%, is very high. So is there an upside to our long-term gross margin target of 53% and higher? Laura, as we mentioned before, there are 6 factors that affect our profitability every year. Excluding the foreign exchange rate, of which we do not have any control on, the other factors taking into consideration, we are confident that a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. And we certainly -- we'll try to work hard to deliver better than that. Okay, thank you very much. That’s very helpful. Okay, thank you. Operator can we move on the next participant please. Next one, we have Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Thanks. Let me try again. My first question is on the U.S. expansion. There's been a lot of commentary around very high cost for U.S. expansion. I think Founder Chairman -- the U.S. perhaps compared to Taiwan. Could you talk a little bit about the U.S. expansion and how they are going? What kind of cost differential is TSMC seeing? And what is your negotiations with the Arizona government solar customers in terms of filling up the cost differential? That's my first. Okay. Gokul, I have to say again, you're breaking in and out. Let me try to summarize your question, make sure I -- we got it right. So Gokul's first question is about our U.S. fab. He notes that the cost is higher. Our founder has recently said this as well. So Gokul, I think your question, again, you broke up, but I think your question is about how do we manage the -- how will we manage the cost gap and close the cost gap? Is that your question? Yes. What is your discussions and negotiation with customers and governments regarding higher cost as well as subsidies? So okay. Thank you, Gokul. So Gokul wants to know, with the higher cost, how our negotiations and discussions with governments? How our negotiations and discussions with customers about this cost differential? Okay. Gokul, yes. Yes, I did mention that the cost in the fab in the U.S. is higher than we expected. We are still in the construction stage of the fab. And during this past two years, we found that the labor cost in the States is higher than we planned. And also, some of the COVID supply chain interruption also was an unexpected. And we did confer this information to the government at the location, give them a full perspective of the cost gap.
But Gokul, is indeed the -- our customer in U.S., they all want to load that fab. I mean, this is the needs from our customers. And we also believe there is ample -- amplify our business opportunity at there. So the cost is increasing, but cost is not the only factors. And we are still working on the government subsidy and we'll continue working on the cost reduction. And every company have different ways to reduce the cost. So that is the work in the process. Thank you, thank you very much. My second question, would the TSMC consider any kind of a joint venture fab in the U.S. with potential large customers? Historically, TSMC has done this with some of the customers like Altera and NXP long back. Would you consider any kind of joint venture fabs potentially with any of the customers in the U.S. if the outsourcing opportunity big enough? Thank you. Okay. So Gokul's second question is, again, would TSMC consider any type of joint venture fab in the U.S. for outsourcing? He notes we have done certain JVs in the past. So is this something we will consider in the U.S. for outsourcing opportunities? Yes. Let me answer this question again. This -- our -- yes, TSMC indeed has some joint venture arrangement maybe 20 years ago within U.S. But right now, we understand -- with that experience, we understand, our customers' demand will go up and down. And we don't -- and also, we don't want to limit this fab into a specific set of customers. It's open to the RO customer base to utilize. So no, at this point, we do not plan to have a joint venture arrangement in the U.S. Okay, Gokul. Operator -- okay, thank you Gokul. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask question, Charles Shi from Needham and Company. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to go back, a quick clarification about N3 gross margin. You kind of mentioned probably first time quantified how much dilution that you're expecting, 2% to 3%. Can you let us know dilution relative to which number because there is one long-term gross margin number to see, 3% and higher, and there is another one which is where your gross margin is tracking? That's a few points above your long-term target. This is kind of a little bit moving target here. So can you clarify with us? Thank you. So Charles is asking if we can clarify our gross margin target. His question, well, I think, again, when we talk about N3 diluting 2% to 3%, it is for the first year, by which is 2023. And so he's wondering I think, Charles, your question is, does this dilution continue? Does this change our long-term gross margin target? And more -- maybe more, I think he is thinking about what are the gross -- yes, sorry, let me stop there. Is that your question, Charles? No, no, no. The 2% to 3% dilution relative to what, is my question. Is it relative to your long-term growth target, 2% to 3% and higher, or where you're tracking, which is 59%, 58%, yes, that's my question? Thank you, Charles. So Charles is asking, when we talk about 2% to 3% dilution, are we looking at 53% diluting from there? Or are we looking at 59% diluting from here? Charles, it's diluting from next year's gross margin as we forecast. It's neither 53% nor 59%. Bear in mind that when we talk about 53% and higher, it already included the dilution effects from the N3 dilutions. Okay, Charles? Do you have a second question? I do. I have a more long-term question. Thank you, Chairman, for mentioning N2 package, which that includes chiplets. I want to specifically ask you about chiplets. I think you recently talked about expanding SOIC capacity by 20 times through 2026. That's quite a big amount of capacity application. I think one year ago, you sort of mentioned SOIC is something you're targeting for high-performance computing application. But given the amount of capacity increases you're planning, any updated thoughts on whether that can be a technology possibly at N2 to use for smartphone platform? Any other color you can give us would be great. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Charles. So Charles second question is on 3D IC. He notes that, in particular, we have talking about SOIC and also expanding the capacity there. We have said in the past, this is primarily adopted by HPC applications. His question is, with such capacity expansion, do we also expect smartphone customers to adopt 3D IC solutions like SOIC at some point in the future? Is that correct, Charles? Yes. Thank you very much. Okay. Let me answer this question, Charles. So far, the SOIC is primarily adopted by the HPC applications. Okay. Because of that it's very fit for their high-speed and power efficient. But for mobile adoption, it will depend on their chiplet's architecture, interconnect density requirement, thermal or other requirement. And we will have other solution to address the mobile requirement. Okay, alright. Thank you, Charles. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Yes, thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to the CapEx. I think the Chairman has guided back in 2021, the shipment guide to worth TWD 100 billion of CapEx during the 2021 through 2023 period. And now this morning, you're highlighting the fact that CapEx this year could be TWD 40 billion. So if I was to use the TWD 100 million, the both suggests to me that your CapEx could be down by as much as 8% to 10% in 2023, unless you are really that TWD 100 billion guide. I just want to get some color on this, and I have a follow-up. Okay. So Mehdi’s first question is on our CapEx. He notes back in April of 2021, we had guided for TWD 100 billion CapEx in the next three years. And so now he's adding the math up for last year and this year, and wondering, does that apply -- sorry, imply a decline in our CapEx for 2023? Or do we have a new revised guidance for the CapEx spend? Mehdi, let me answer this. We're not going to talk about the TWD 100 billion today. We're not going to comment CapEx beyond 2022. We've already given the guidance range of 2022. Now as we mentioned before, every year, when we invest in CapEx, it is for the future growth opportunities. So as long as there -- we believe the future outlook is good, we will continue to invest in a disciplined manner. Got it. And just a quick follow-up here. Despite the fact that CapEx was up 76% last year, 2021, the depreciation so far has been tracking flattish. It was flat in Q1, down 2% in Q2. Should I expect a big step-up in depreciation going forward? Okay. So Mehdi also wants to follow up to ask about depreciation. Despite the increase in CapEx, why is the depreciation growth pretty flattish or low so far this year? And then should we expect a step-up in depreciation for 2023? Mehdi, every year, there are new depreciation coming in. But at the same time, there are depreciation getting out of the depreciation table. So some comes in, some goes out. This year, we expect that depreciation will grow above mid-single-digits from last year. It is slower -- lower than when we guided at the beginning of the year because of some two delivery schedule change, as C.C. mentioned earlier. Now for next year, the -- it's too early to give a specific number, but the depreciation will be much higher than this year. Okay. And just since everyone had most second question, may I squeeze one quick follow-up? Well, you have 1.5. I'll let you another half question, please, Mehdi, because we still have a few people on the line. Yes. Sure. I'll make it very quick. When I look at your customers, their inventories are at a 25-year high. And I think everyone is going to take a look at the seasonality in the second half. And I'm just curious, what are the key variables? What are the key metrics? Or what are the key strategies that you have in place that could mitigate the gross margin balance by this if your customers become more aggressive in inventory correction into next year? Okay. So Mehdi's question is noting customer inventory at customers are very high. So what would be the key variables or metrics for TSMC to mitigate our gross margin downside or risk if customers were to adjust their inventory further? Is that correct, Mehdi? Yes. If they become more aggressive in inventory correction into first half next year. If they were customers were to become more aggressive on their inventory correction into first half next year. Well, let me answer the question. As I stated in the remark, our customer are doing the inventory correction. But I said that customers demand still exceeds the TSMC's capability to support for this year. So even they do the inventory adjustment, what I say that they decrease their demand versus their original number, TSMC's capacity is still very tight and will remain very healthy in the utilization. So that's why we can keep our gross margin intact. Did I answer your question? Thank you, Mehdi. Operator, let’s move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Brad Lin from Bank of America. Hello, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my question. So firstly, our congratulations once again on the strong earnings. And my first question is about advanced packaging. We learned the advanced packaging is very, very important for TSMC's long-term growth and TSMC has a great variety of offering to provide higher value to customers.
So would you please share your insights on what are the key barriers are for wider adoption by plants? And would you expect the contribution mix to increase gradually? Or if there is a point to see an explosive growth from the advanced packaging? And by the way, we saw the news about the DDIC in Japan and how will that can accelerate their progress. Thank you very much. Okay. So Brad's question is on advanced packaging. I believe if I heard you correctly, what are the key barriers for wider adoption of our packaging solutions by customers? What is the long-term revenue growth outlook of advanced packaging? Is it going to be explosive growth or growth similar to the corporate average and also the role of our 3DIC center in Japan in developing advanced packaging solutions? Okay. That's a very long question, but let me answer one by one. First, we developed a very advanced packaging technology to meet the customers' demand. So far today, 3DIC or SOIC, we develop for the high-speed performance, HPC applications first. And the other one, mostly starting to be adopted by all HPC customers starting from today.
So we expect is gradually will ramp up. And until that's 2-nanometer, I think I have much more demand in that technology node for the 3DIC. That's what we expect. And we expect the growth of these 3DIC business will be healthy, probably a little bit ahead of TSMC's growth forecast.
Now let me turn to the 3DIC center in Japan. We established 3DIC center because of Japan has a fundamental advantage on the raw material also under packaging area. For example, the substrate, they are the number 1 in the world. And we need that one technology to complement the TSMC's 3DIC technology so we can serve our customer better. And that's why we established a 3DIC center technology development center over there. Did I answer your question? Yes, yes. Very clear. Thank you, sir. So maybe another follow-up, that's also about the IC substrate. So ABF actually substrate currently plays a very important role in advance packaging, of course, especially for coax and the substrate demand potentially in largest with the increasing advanced packaging penetration. So with the rising integration level of a chip, do you expect new material to potentially replace ABF? And any plan to secure substrate supply or upgrade the designs for TSMC for future requirements? And maybe one last follow-up is that, if we compare 2.5D and 3D, would you need more substrate for 3D? Thank you. Okay. Well, Brad's second question is on substrates. He wants to know, with the development of substrates and the adoption, do we see further developments in terms of new materials? Will we see more substrates used in 3DIC versus 2.5D? And will we -- how do we secure the substrate supply? Well, this one we are working with the substrate partner. And your question is the 2D, 2.5D or 3D, both, both are important. But let me tell you one further step. We're only interested in the very advance technology. We are not going to develop any commodity of the substrate technology to compete in the market. No. We are developing for the very high performance computing or very large substrate to support TSMC's customer. That's our purpose. Okay. Thank you, C.C. Operator, can we move on to the next participant. Next one to ask question, Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them. The first one is, when I look at your full year guidance of 35% revenue growth, it looks like calendar 4Q or the December quarter is going to be sequentially down more than 10%. And that hasn't happened in a long time. So I'm kind of curious, how much of that is driven by demand versus FX?
And then the second question, a follow-up is, if I look at your CapEx run rate, the first half is running at about TWD 17 billion, which is below the lower end of your full year guidance. So I'm kind of curious, what are the tool delays that's causing the pushout of CapEx into next year? Is it like EUV? Is it like depth edge tools? Any color on that would be super helpful. Thank you very much. Okay. So Krish has two questions. First is looking at our full year guidance to grow mid-30s, and he says this implies a decline in the fourth quarter? No, I don't think so. We did the calculation. Maybe you can do that again. It's at least up. Yes. Krish, I would note that when we talk about mid-30s guidance, as C.C. said, that is in U.S. dollar terms. Okay. And then his second question is on CapEx and sort of looking at the CapEx. His question is we have already said it will be closer to the lower end of the range. He wants to know what is driving the CapEx. Is it tool delays? Is it EUV? What types of equipment? No. I don't think we can go into that kind of details. But some of them got pushed out to next year, as C.C. mentioned. And every year, the CapEx profile can be difference quarter-by-quarter. Okay, thank you. Operator, in the interest of time, I think we’ll take questions from the last two participants, please. So, let’s move on to the next. The next one to ask questions, Frank Lee from HSBC. Thank you. I wanted to just ask a question on, I guess, the overall profitability and also pricing. It seems like this year, we start to see a foundry price increase and a bit unusual for TSMC. And going into next year, it looks like there's some manifestation of further price increases. But at the same time, we're also seeing potentially inventory correction. So just trying to understand the pricing strategy itself, is this more of a reflection of perhaps the structural profitability for this cycle being different than the past? Or are there any kind of cost that we're seeing this time that we haven't seen in past cycles. Okay. So Frank's first question is on pricing. He wants to know what is driving our pricing strategy. How do the cost inflation or factors play into it? And really what drives TSMC's pricing? Yes. We do not comment on our pricing details. These are the private discussion between us and our customers. Having said that, our pricing is strategic and value-driven, not opportunistic or cost plus. We work closely with our customers to provide our value. And we will continue to ensure that our pricing reflects our value creations, including technology, ecosystem, and services and capacity support. By taking all these actions, we believe we can achieve a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher. We do face manufacturing cost challenges. As we mentioned, rising raw materials, utilities and tool costs, et cetera. But having said that, we still think that the 53% long-term gross margin is achievable, and 53% and higher. Okay. Frank, do you have a second question? My second question is, I understand the overall view on that. But given what you guys just talked about the overall cycle, I know you still have some -- the leadership in the event side and everything else. But is there a potential bill effect where customers could see a stronger second half this year in anticipation of price increases? And with the adjustment going into next year, that we see some more weakness in the first half more than anticipated in the first half? Okay. Well, Frank's second question is with pricing, will -- could there be a situation where customers, I guess, will pull in more of their business to second half of this year, and thus, we would see a weaker first half next year. No, we did not see that. We are actually -- we are working with our customers and we try our best to support our customers. As I said, even right now, our capacity remains very tight. So the switching between the next year's first quarter and this year's second half, no, we did not see that, just simply put it. Great. Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we take questions from the last participant, please. The last one to ask questions, Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two. The first one is just if you could just discuss how much of next year's revenue is under LTA. The reason I'm asking is because there are some people in the market thinking that customers may be fearful of pushing our wafers because they may be jeopardizing agreements for next year. And then the second question would be just to on the chiplet question. I was just wondering what percentage of the 2-nanometer HPC designs will be using a chiplet architecture. Is it the majority? What's the adoption rate? Thanks. Okay. So Robert's first question is he wants to know how much percentage of revenue to long-term agreements with customers represent for TSMC. Maybe Wendell can address this question. Yes. Robert, we don't discuss the details like that. We work very diligently and closely with the customers to plan the capacity including receiving the prepayments for capacity support. And we will continue to work with them to decide to determine the best way to support them going forward. Okay. And then his second question is on N2. He wants to know, for HPC applications on N2, what is the percentage or that may adopt a chiplet architecture approach? I cannot release the number. But let me assure you that the number of the customers using the chiplet in the N2 or the 2-nanometer technology will start to increase and that will become a major approach in the 2-nanometer and the following technologies. Okay. Thank you, C.C. Thank you, Robert. And thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within one hour from now and the transcript will become available 24 hours from now. Both of which you can find available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. So thank you for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay healthy and safe. And we hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a good day.","TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast . the format for today's event will be as follows . tsmc's vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2022 .",1.0

TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the Company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode.
The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2022, followed by our guidance for the fourth quarter 2022. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter.
The third quarter revenue increased 14.8% sequentially in NT dollar, or 11.4% in US dollars, as our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry leading 5-nanometer technology.
Third quarter gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 60.4%. Slightly ahead of our guidance, as we enjoyed a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts. Total operating expenses accounted for 9.8% of net revenue as compared to 10% in the previous quarter. Operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 50.6%, mainly due to better operating leverage. Overall, our third quarter EPS was NT$10.83, and ROE was 42.9%.
Now, let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 28% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometre accounted for 26%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below accounted for 54% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 25% quarter-over-quarter to account for 41% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 4% to account for 39%, IoT increased 33% to account for 10%. Automotive increased 15%, to account for 5% and DCE decreased 2% to account for 2%.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT$1.5 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by NT$38 billion, mainly due to the decrease of NT$116 billion in short term loans, partially offset by the increase of NT$70 billion in accrual liabilities and others.
Long-term interest bearing debt increased by NT$88 billion mainly as we raise NT$60 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. Our financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 36 days. Inventory decrease -- inventory days decreased five days to 90 days, primarily due to higher wafer shipment during the quarter.
Now, let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about NT$413 billion in cash from operations spent NT$266 billion in CapEx, distributed NT$71 billion in fourth quarter '21 cash dividends and raise NT$60 billion from corporate bond issuances.
Overall, our cash balance increased by NT$43 billion to NT$1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures total NT$8.75 billion.
I have finished my financial summary, now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $19.9 billion and $20.7 billion US, which represents 0.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to NT$31.5 gross margin is expected to be between 59.5% and 61.5%, operating margin between 49% and 51%.
This concludes my financial presentation. Now, let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our third quarter and fourth quarter profitability. Compared to the second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 130 basis points sequentially to 60.4% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, despite continue inflationary cost pressures.
Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago, as our guide was based on exchange rate assumption of $1 to NT$29.7, whereas the actual third quarter exchange rate was $1 to NT$30.32. This created about 80 basis point difference in our actual third quarter gross margin versus our original guidance.
We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to be flattish sequentially to 60.5% at the midpoint, as a more favorable exchange rate assumption will be offset by a lower capacity utilization rates. As a reminder, six factors determined TSMC's profitability, leadership technology development and ramp up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate.
Looking ahead to 2023, we face challenges from entry ramp dilution, higher year-over-year increase in depreciation cost, rising inflationary cost semiconductor cyclicality and overseas fab expansions.
To manage our profitability in 2023, we are working closely with our customers to support their growth and continue to strategically and consistently sell our value. We are also working diligently on our internal cost improvement.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates of which we have no control over and taking the other five factors into consideration, we believe a long term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our 2022 CapEx. As I have stated before, every year our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Three months ago, we said our 2022 CapEx will be closer to the lower end of our NT$40 to NT$44 billion range. Now, we are further tightening up this year's capital spending and expect our 2022 CapEx to be around $36 billion.
About half of the change is due to capacity optimization based on the current medium term outlook. And the other half is still to continue to delivery challenges. Out of the around $36 billion CapEx for 2022, between 70% to 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making and 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Looking ahead, we will continue to manage our business prudently given the near term uncertainties and adjust and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customer’s growth remains unchanged. And our discipline CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term structure and market demand profile.
We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.
Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Good afternoon everyone. First, let me start with TSMC's more resilient near term demand outlook. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of NT$613.1 billion or US dollar $20.2 billion, supported by strong demand for our industry leading 5-nanometer technologies.
Moving into fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as customers are ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continue ramp up of our 5-nanometer technologies supported by smartphone and HPC applications. We expect our full year gross in 2022 to be mid 30% in US dollar terms.
On the demand side, we continue to observe softness in consumer end market segment. Other end market segments such as data center and automotive related remain steady for now for TSMC. But we start to see the possibility of adjustment unrolled.
On the inventory side, our customers and the supply chain continue to take action to adjust their inventory. We expect the semiconductor supply chain inventory to pick in third quarter this year and start to reduce in fourth quarter this year. We also expect it will take a few quarters, so first half 2023 to rebalance to a healthier level.
While the ongoing inventory correction will also affect TSMC, we expect our business to be less volatile and more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry during this period. Supported by three key factors that are TSMC's cost raise in the foundry industry. First, our technology leadership and differentiation is much stronger today as compared to previous years. This enable TSMC to win business and enables our customer doing business in high end markets, despite the semiconductor cyclicality.
Secondary, through our comprehensive design ecosystem and optimize the process technologies, we are able to address and capture the structure increase in demand for computation and build a strong portfolio in high performance computing.
Third, our strategical relationships with our customers are long term in nature, and we continue to work closely with our customer and technology development, capacity planning and pricing to support their long term demand and growth. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our leading node except N7 and steady demand for our differentiated specialty technologies and mature node.
Looking ahead to 2023 with a successful ramp up of N5 N4P, N4X and the upcoming ramp of N3, we're continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. There's one other ongoing semiconductor inventory correction will affect the first half 2023 utilization rate. We expect our business to be supported by stronger demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies, and for 2023 to be a growth year for TSMC.
Next, let me talk about the N7 and 6 demand outlook. Due to end market weakness in smartphone and PCs and customer’s products scheduled delay starting 4Q this year, our N7, N6 capacity utilization, will not be as high as it has been in the past three years. We expect this to persist for a few quarters through first half 2023 as the semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level, and we have adjusted our N7, N6 CapEx accordingly.
We believe the N7, N6 demand is more a cyclical issue rather than structural and we expect our N7 N6 demand to pick up in second half 2023.
Longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technology and are confident to drive additional wave of structural demand to backfill our N7 N6 capacity over the next several years. The 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our N3 is on track for volume production later this quarter with good year. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. Our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply partially due to the ongoing tool delivery issues, and we expect entry to be fully utilized in 2023.
We expect N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its first year in 2020 and for N3E to contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our wafer revenue in 2023, as our overall revenue base is much larger today than in 2020. N3E will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance power and yield, and offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. N3E development is progressing ahead of plan, and volume production is now scheduled for second half 2023.
Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we observe a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x than that of N5 in its first and second year. Thus, we are working closely with our tool supplier to address towards delivery challenges and prepare more 3-nanometer capacity to support our customers with strong demand in 2023, 2024 and beyond.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. We are confident that N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, let me talk about the future driver of leading node adoption. TSMC's ambition is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. Our job is to help our customers unleash their innovations and enable them to capture greater value and win in their end markets. As the industry continues to pursue scaling, it is true that damage shrink is slowing down and becoming more challenging for everyone due to rising process complexity.
However, it is also true that demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world as technology is becoming more pervasive and essential in people's lives.
The semiconductor industry value in the supply chain is increasing, and the value of technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and increasingly toward greater power efficiency. As a result, our customers value much more than simply transistor cost. System performance and power efficiency has become key motivation for customers who adopt our leading node technologies.
By working closely with our customer and technology development, our N3 and N2 will deliver full node stride in performance and power benefits while offering the industry's most advanced transistor scaling. We expect strong demand for our leading node technologies, driven by both smartphone and HPC applications to fuel our long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms.
With our leadership in both leading-edge process technology and 3D solutions, TSMC's technology cadence remain constant to deliver the value of our technology platform. We will continue to extend our overall competitiveness and technology leadership while delivering a predictable technology cadence that help our customers to enhance their product competitiveness and grow their market well into the future.
This concluding our key message, and thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask questions. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our Management answers your question.
[Operator Instructions]. Now let's begin the Q&A session, operator can we please proceed with the first participant on the line. Yes, Jeff. The first one to ask questions Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results, especially on the margins. So the first question is on N7 and N6, this utilization slack that we are observing. Could we give a little bit more detail on why that is happening and why we think this is short-lived, a couple of quarters issue and we get a pick back in the utilization in the second half of the year?
And I think last time we saw, this was for 28-nanometer, but that lasted for a much longer period of time. So could you also give us some kind of comparison with what happened back in 28-nanometer and why this is going to be very different? And maybe a little bit more color on what are the areas of backfill demand for N7 and N6 as the high-end smartphone processors and HPC start to move on to N5 and then N3. That's my first question. Okay, Gokul, let me please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is on N7 and N6. He wants to understand what is driving the utilization slack. Why do we believe it is short-lived and that the demand for N7 and N6 can pick up in the second half? And then also on the little bit longer-term outlook, why we believe that N7 can be backfilled, and it will not be like N28 a few years ago with a few years of underutilization. Well, Gokul, maybe answer your question first on the why demand dropped. Demand dropped because of market becomes soft. As we said, in the weakness in the smartphone and PCs. And also a big factor is our customers' product schedule delay. And all in all, put all together, so we think that our utilization has been affected in fourth quarter this year and all the way to the first half of 2023.
For the longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers. And actually, let me also say that this is a cyclical issue. So it will pick up anyway. And we believe we will pick up in the second half of 2023. And for the longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technology to drive additional wave of structural demand from consumer, RF, connectivity, et cetera, and other application to backfill our N7, N6 capacity and so for the next several years. That’s all I… Does that answer your first question, Gokul? Yes. My second question would be on the CapEx outlook. Now that we bring down the CapEx slightly for 2022, could you talk a little bit about what is the outlook direction for 2023 at least, if not absolute numbers, but just direction? Are we going to be flattish or it's likely to be going down?
Second is, also, could you also give us an update on the schedule for the new fabs, Cauchon, Kumamoto, Nanjing and Arizona? Is there any change in the schedules in terms of these fabs coming into production? Thank you. Okay, thank you, Gokul. So Gokul's second question is on CapEx and capacity. So first, he wants to hear, of course, he says that we have tightened up our CapEx in 2022. So he is asking for 2023 directionally, is there an indication of 2023 CapEx? And then he would also like an update on our expansion plans in Guosheng, Nanjing, Arizona and Kumamoto. Okay, Gokul, let me answer you the first part. For 2023 CapEx, it is too early to comment. We will provide you with a specific guidance in January. However, as we said, we have tightened up our 2022 CapEx to reflect the current medium outlook, as well as two delivery issues.
Looking ahead to 2023, we will continue to be careful and manage our business prudently given the near-term uncertainties. We will adjust and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate, but we will continue to work closely with our customers to invest for the long-term structural market demand profile to support their growth. Well, let me answer the second part of Gokul's question. Gokul, you asked about the progress of our Arizona fab, Nanjing fab and the Gaozong. And let me say that Arizona fab work will continue and on schedule. There's no doubt about it because this is a N5 family which still have a very strong demand.
And for Nanjing we just get our one-year authorization for 28-nanometer expansion. So it is on schedule also. For Gaozong, initially, we planned 2 fab at the beginning of 28-nanometer expansion and the N7. Now N7 has been adjusted. And so but 28-nanometer expansion is continued and on schedule. And also Kumamoto. Okay. Also the Japan fab is on schedule to meet the customer's demand. Got it. Thank you very much. Alright, thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next participant please. The next one to ask questions is Bruce from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is regarding to the HPC, which is a key growth driver for TSMC for the coming years. However, with the reason U.S. new restriction to China, what do you think about the HPC demand moving forward. What kind of impact is going to see a slowdown from China? Or are you going to see the collaboration from the non-China side? Okay, so Bruce's first question is on HPC. He notes HPC, we have said repeatedly, will be TSMC's key growth driver and main engine in the next few years. He wants to know, I believe, Bruce, the impact of the recent U.S. regulations, does that affect the overall HPC demand or the overall profile. Is that correct? Yes, what's the impact from this new restriction to TSMC and overall industry? Okay, let me answer that. Bruce, it's based on our initial reading and feedback from our customers. The new regulation set the control was called at very high-end specification, which is primarily used for AI or supercomputing applications. Therefore, our initial assessment is the impact to TSMC is limited and manageable. We will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that we are all in full compliance with all the rules and regulation.
And for the longer term, it's too early to really assess all the true impact or influence, but we will give you the update in the following earnings call. Okay, understand that. Thank you. So my next question is regarding to the cyclical nature for the 7-nanometer. But we also noticed that most of your other nodes, the capacity utilization rate is still at a very, very high level or at least much better than 7-nanometers as management mentioned. Why is 7-nanometer so cyclical? Because maybe because you guys are too big, you have to industry or what is the difference between your 7-nanometers and your other nodes? Okay, so Bruce's second question is looking at N7 specifically. He wants to know our other nodes seem -- the utilization still seems to be holding up well. So why specifically N7 is more cyclical and utilization is not as high as it has been. Is that correct, Bruce? Yes. Okay. It just happened that most of my smartphone and PCs customer are using N7 and N6 node. And it just happened, the market weakness in the smartphone and PC happening at the same time. And also other customers or product schedule delay, all in all, that's why it becomes lower utilization rate as compared with other node. If you want to compare with the N5 or compare with the 28-nanometer, our orders are very -- is still at a very high demand, and we will continue to enjoy the higher market share. I want to dig in a bit because we get used to like TSMC will manage your customers' product and overall outlook even with some tape-out you can make it out with someone else. But anything different with this time that 7-nanometer, you cannot have as good as your other nodes? So Bruce wants to still understand why the 7-nanometer utilization cannot be as high as the other nodes if we work closely with customers, and is well planned. Well, again, Bruce, we work closely with our customers, but our customers get caught in this inventory correction and the market downturn. They didn't know this one, probably two quarters before. And at the beginning of this year, they will still give us a very high number of their forecast. And it just happened, it just happened. But as we said, we believe this is a cyclical issue. And it will pick up. But before that, it probably will take a few quarters. I see, understand. Thank you. We just get too used to it to be like -- to expect TSMC always deliver a much better result. I understand. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next caller please. Next, we have Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse. Yes, okay. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a two-part first question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about HPC and auto continue to be stable, but seem to signal it may change. If you could give your view how you see inventory levels and some of the forward demand outlook from those areas.
And the second part, I just want to see if we could get a bit better visibility on first half first quarter, how do you see it versus normal seasonal? And then for the trough, do you expect first quarter could be the bottom, or do you see the trend that we could be towards the second quarter? Okay, so Randy's question is really looking at again from the end demand segment. Data center and automotive, we say are remaining steady at TSMC for now. He wants to understand though, what is the outlook down the road, and what does that mean for inventory levels? And then secondly is also he wants to see if we can provide some more granularity about first quarter outlook versus seasonality and whether we think the first quarter can be the bottom for the industry. Is that correct, Randy? Yes, that's correct. Okay, let me answer this one. Of course, we say that so far, our customers give us their demand forecast -- so the data center and automotive related are still steady. But now the market becomes solved and will take a more conservative way in our planning for 2023. And that's why we say that we don't rule out the possibility. They might have some correction also, but we did not see it right now, to be frank with you.
And for the inventory correction in 2023, all we want to say is like that. We expect probably 2023, the semiconductor industry were likely to decline. But TSMC also is not immune, we believe our technology position, strong portfolio in HPC and longer-term strategic relationship with customers will enable our business to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry. And that's why we say in 2023 still a growth year for TSMC and the overall industry probably will decline. Okay. Again, and I'll ask a quick follow-up, and then the second question. I guess just a sense because it's still very firm in fourth quarter, if you're seeing a pretty meaningful falloff into first quarter, like some years 10%. 2019 declined over 20%. So just trying to get a rough feel of the type of decline factoring you're gaining some content and share. That's fell to the first.
And then the second question, actually, just on gross margin because of a lot of headwinds, I think, Wendell, you talked about. If you could give -- just on a couple of these depreciation factoring the recent CapEx, how much up and whether it's also front end or more back half loaded given the 3-nanometer ramp. And then for the start-up costs for N3 if you expect similar to N5, given smaller percent of revenue, how much dilution from N3? Thank you. Okay, Randy. So let me summarize. So Randy, quick, I think we will not comment on the first quarter, but I think we can make some comment just sort of in terms of the overall inventory picture in looking into next year. Well, actually, if you ask my opinion on the inventory picture and the inventory correction, it's too early to provide a specific number. However, the inventory correction were likely see its biggest impact sometimes in the first half 2023. Okay, and then the second part related to the gross margin, maybe Wendell can address what is the outlook for depreciation next year, some of the -- and then is it front or back-end loaded? And also what type of dilution we expect from 3-nanometer as it ramps in 2023. Okay, Randy. For full year depreciation for next year, it's too early to talk about that. But this year is mid-single-digit increase year-on-year. But next year, we expect it will likely to be meaningfully higher. We will give you the guidance in January.
As to the dilution from N3, it will be between 2 to 3 percentage points on a whole year basis on our gross margins. Okay, and actually, one follow-up. Do you think on a single quarter with the inventory correction, do you expect to keep the 53 and above factoring were coming from a very high level even through that first half inventory correction? Right. It is too early to talk about 2023, gross margin including quarter-over-quarter. But even with all these cost challenges, we believe our structural profitability can be maintained, and we are confident to deliver a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher. Okay. Okay, great, thanks. Thank you, Randy. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So my first question to management is about whether the company consider a share buyback because the company seems to suggest recent inventory correction is just a cyclical, you're still very positive on the long term. And I think the share price really revealed comes long-term value, right, also shareholders' value. So I'm not sure if a company wants to do share buyback or cash returns? Okay. So Charlie's first question is that although there's cyclicality, the long-term outlook appears good. Would the company consider doing a share buyback? Yes, Charlie, we constantly review all the different options of returning cash to shareholders. For share buyback, at this moment, we are not considering it. We think our cash on hand will be better kept to invest in our capital expenditure to make a better return for our shareholders. Okay, understood. Thank you. And also, my second question is also about the U.S. sanction impact? I know the company said that NPAs limited and the long-term impact remains to be seen, right, but my question is about your -- the China market to TSMC, is that as strategic as before after these events? Okay, so Charlie, second question, he wants to know with the recent U.S. regulations and the impact, how do we see the China market? Is it still a strategic market for TSMC? Is that correct, Charlie? Yes, meaning whether -- how this company think about China for TSMC's long-term picture, how important it is to China going forward? Charlie, I would like to say that every region is important to TSMC. However, let me say that, under the condition of work compliance with all the rules and regulations, TSMC will continue to serve all the customer all over the world. That's our position. Okay, including China? All the customers. Okay, got it. Thank you. Those are my questions. Thank you. Thank you, Charlie. Operator can we move onto the next participant please. Next one to ask questions, Sunny Lin from UBS. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the steady performance. My first question is on the geopolitical tensions. I wonder, given some of the considerations regarding the geopolitical issues, how would you evaluate a longer-term impact from customers potentially diversifying from Asian foundries? And how are you managing the risk? Thank you. Okay, so Sunny's first question is that given the geopolitical tensions, how do we evaluate the long-term impact and the risk of customers using other foundries? Is that correct, Sunny? Correct. Thank you. Sunny, we still believe the most important is in is a technology leadership, manufacturing and our customer trust. And so in different locations, manufacturing or whatever, we still think that technology leadership is the most important thing. And so that's our strategy. We make it simple, the technology, manufacturing and customer trust. Got it. And so a quick follow-up. Is that going forward, should we assume an acceleration of your overseas expansions just to diversify the production site, i.e., if there could be a fab built in Europe? Okay, so Sunny's second question then, does that -- can we assume that we will continue to increase the overseas global footprint expansion and also particularly in Europe? Well, we will continue to increase our overseas portion in manufacturing based on customers' need, in fact, based on the business opportunity and also based on the operations efficiency and economics. And so whether we are going to be in Europe, we are in preliminary evaluation and to not rule out any possibility.
Again, I would like to say the decision were based on customers' need, business opportunities, operational efficiency and the cost economics. Got it, thank you. I actually have a second question on HPC. So with the increasing usage of chiplets, how would you manage the risk in the case that some dies are made at the other foundries and that have production issues and therefore, impacting the production at TSMC as well? Thank you very much. So Sunny, second question is with increasing usage and adoption of shipments -- sorry, chiplets in HPC, how would we manage the risk in case I think Sunny you're saying it dies at other companies or places have production issues, would how do we manage the risk of that impacting TSMC? Sunny, in fact, we would like our customer manufacturing every chip inside TSMC for sure. But if there is a case that they have to use other companies' dies, we will work with our customers closely and minimize all the risk that some goes by. That's what we are doing right now. Got it. Thank you, that's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant please. Right now, we have Laura Chen from Citi. Thank you, for taking my question. I appreciate that if you can share with your latest plan in your Nanjing fab. Like C.C. already mentioned, you got the license for the 28-nanometer in Nanjing. So I'm just wondering that do you also need a license for the 16-nanometer in the Nanjing fab? And also going forward, what's your trend of your operation in China? That's my first question. Thank you. Okay, so Laura's first question is about Nanjing fab and our plans. She notes that we have received the one-year authorization. So our 28-nanometer expansion continues as planned. Her question is, do we also need a license for the 16-nanometer that we have in Nanjing? And then also her -- also what is our long-term future expansion plans in China. Sunny, let me answer the first part. Laura. Sorry, it's Laura. Let me answer the first part. The one-year authorization that we received cover the Nanjing facility. So it's both the 28 and 16. Okay, great. Thank you. And then the second part is what is our long-term expansion plans for China? Okay. As C.C. said, we will be operating -- serving all the customers under the condition that we will fully follow in compliance with all the rules and regulations. Okay, that's very clear. My second question is also about the fab globally in the longer term. We know that in overseas operation, usually, they will have a much higher operational cost. So how would that impact the TSMC's long-term margin trend in our view, or maybe you can give us some information about your estimate of the percentage of the margin in different region or the cost difference comparing to Taiwan? Okay, so Laura's second question is around our expansion of our global manufacturing footprint. She wants to know that overseas fabs, are the costs higher? Do we have a breakdown how much the cost difference is in Japan, U.S. versus Taiwan? And then overall, with overseas expansion and if there are higher costs, how does this impact our long-term profitability and margin? Okay, Laura, let me answer this question. The initial cost of overseas fabs are indeed higher than TSMC's fab in Taiwan. And it's mainly because of higher labor costs in different layers of the supply chain. We continue to work closely with the U.S. government, as well as with our customers and supply chain partner to manage and minimize the cost gap. Now through these efforts, we believe we can continue to earn the proper return and deliver the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher. Okay, that's very clear. Thank you very much. Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions is Rolf Bulk from New Street Research. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could give some more context around the 3-nanometer tool shortages that you mentioned. Is that primarily lithography, and then specifically EUV related, or do you also see shortages in other tool segments? Thank you. Okay. So Rolf's first question is around 3-nanometer and the tool shortages. He wants to know if this is very -- just specific to lithography tools and EUV specifically, or is it more I guess, broad-based? Let me answer the question. Actually, it's more broad based because of our demand is high -- and certainly, the photo lithography tool is included and one of the most important one. Thank you. That's reasonable. As my follow-up question, it would be great to get an update on your N2 notes, which your current visibility is now it's still on track timing-wise and is there anything you can share on how you think about yields of N2 versus N5 and N3 at the same stage of development? Okay, so Rolf's second question is on N2. He would like an update. Are we still on track? What is the timing for N2? And also if there's any update on yields as compared to N3 and N5 at similar stage. Okay, I said before, N2 is a very deep quarter one, but our progress so far, so good. Actually, it's a little bit ahead. And we are going to have a mass production introduced in 2025. And our customers' engagement so far are very -- let me say that, comparable with the N3, N5. And the status today is very comparable to the N5 and also N3. So we are happy to see that our progress so far. Does that answer your question, Rolf? Thank you very much. Thank you, Rolf. Okay, operator let’s move on to the next participant please. Next one, we have Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, both on CapEx. The first question is really -- and I understand you're not here to guide 2023 CapEx. But I think a few years ago, you did provide some long-term CapEx, a range of CapEx when your long-term CAGR guidance was 5% to 10%. And you think 10 to 12 billion CapEx is going to support that long-term CAGR. I think you just reiterated your long-term CAGR to be 15% to 20%. Do you kind of have a similar range of CapEx for us to think about over long term? Again, I'm not asking you about '23 CapEx year. Okay, so Charles' first question is about -- really, I think, Charles, you're asking about CapEx correlation with growth. So he notes that. In the past, we have said our long-term growth would be 5% to 10%. So during that period, we said we would spend between NT$10 billion to NT$12 billion.
So without asking about 2023 specifically, Charles wants to know, now we believe we will grow between 15% to 20% CAGR in the next few years. What type of CapEx range does that imply or should he assume? Is that correct, Charles? Yes, correct. Okay, Charles, I think it will be -- let me try to answer this question from the capital intensity point of view. When we invest heavily to capture the future growth, the capital intensity will be high like last year and this year. But if the growth slows down, the capital intensity may become lower.
Now longer term wise, we think that a normal reasonable capital intensity may be somewhere between mid to high 30 percentages longer-term-wise. The second question is about very near term into the next quarter basically because you just slashed your 2022 CapEx, I mean from what you guided one quarter ago by about 4 billion. If I hear correctly, half of that is can be attributed to the tool delivery issues. But the other half, can you clarify a little bit, because you kind of said it's about capacity optimization. Is that the kind of like a 2 billion reduction in CapEx, mostly a reduction of the equipment spending, or is it something else you are reducing here and trying to improve the capital capacity optimization here? Thank you. Okay, so Charles' second question is on the CapEx and he is asking we have now guided to around 36 billion versus close to 40 billion last time. We have said half of it is related to tool delivery and the other half is capacity optimization for the midterm demand outlook. So his question is with the capacity optimization is this mainly also a reduction in tools, or is there some other issue right? Is that correct, Charles? Yes, correct. Thank you. Okay. Charles, I think the -- you're right that the half of that difference comes from tool delivery issue. The other half is the capacity optimization by that, and that's because of the current uncertainty in market conditions. So we're tightening up our capital budget. And it relates to the whole capacity. It's including tools, including the other stuff within the CapEx. Yes, and it's mainly N7. Thank you very much. Yes, it's tools and also as C.C. and Wendell mentioned, some of the adjustments we have made to our N7 and N6 capacity and CapEx due to the aforementioned reasons. Thanks.
Okay, thank you Charles. Operator can we move on to the next participant. Next one, we have Brad Lin from BoA Securities. Go ahead please. Thank you very much for taking my questions. First of all, congratulations on the strong earnings, and my first question is about, well, if we look at the loan pages of the new regulations from the U.S. on China, it can be really broad and with the -- of course, with the key on the supercomputing. But however, given the wide variety and also wider application of chips that TSMC makes, isn't it, in theory, difficult to identify and make sure the chipset is business compliant with the regulation, or will there be some extra costs and overhead costs by that which wish you notice in the future? Thank you. That's my first question. Okay. So Brad's first question is with the new U.S. regulations, he knows it's very long and very wide in scope. So he is wondering if it's very hard to interpret and therefore, will this result in greater overhead cost for TSMC to ensure that we are and continue to be fully compliant with all the regulations. Well, actually, although it's rule is about more than 100 pages, but initial region and feedback from our customer, actually, the regulation is very simple to be understood like control switch hold at a very high-end specification. For example, like 600 bit per second bandwidth or those kind of things, it's very easily to be understood, and we continue to work with our customers to make sure that we fully comply with the regulation. And so Brad would also like to know, Wendell, from a financial standpoint, will we incur more overhead cost as a result? At this moment, we don't think so. I see, thank you very much. Just a slight follow-up because the regulation is just aiming at the first supercomputing, but I know in a supercomputer, definitely, there are some -- still some low-end chips used inside. So if we happen to make those, and we are not sure that it is going there when we produce them with that, will that cause some confusion or bring some trouble to us? So Brad's second question is in a super computer, there may be very specific high-end restrictions, but there's also companion chips, other chips used. Would that cause us an issue? The company achieved, there is no restriction or no regulation at all. So we reran on our customer to work with their own customer for that kind of a product. Got it. Thank you very much. And then maybe, if I may, second question will be clearly, many countries would like to build their own foundry or their own domestic supply chain. We have learned that the cost will be a major downside. So my question would be can we charge different pricing that's basically demanded by our clients, right? So with higher costs, if they want to buy from U.S. or buy from Europe, can we charge a higher pricing if that's based on the node? And also, if we think about the bright side, would you please share how TSMC could well utilize these kind of opportunities to strengthen our competitiveness in the long run? That will be my all questions. So Brad's second question is about he notes that many countries would like to have domestic semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC, we are, as C.C. said, also increasing and expanding our global manufacturing footprint. So with higher cost, will we be able to charge a higher price? I guess that is essentially his question. Actually, TSMC's pricing is strategic and consistent, and we -- all I can say is we will continue to see our value. The values come from the technology manufacturing, and also that our relationship with our customers, whether it is in a different country or a different place, it's not in our consideration. Again, I would like to say we'll continue to see our value and our pricing is strategic. Okay? Okay. Thank you, Brad. Operator can we move on to the next participant please. Next one, we have Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I also have my first multipart question. I'm just looking at your customers' inventories that are on a days of inventory are at a 25-year high. And it seems based on your commentary that the demand forecast, especially looking at the first half, has weakened. So it seems to me that the inventory correction is going to sustain to Q2 and more slightly, your shipment would be declining sequentially in Q1 and Q2.
Just looking at your customers' inventory, is that a realistic view of the first half? Because you also highlighted the fact that inventory correction is going to sustain throughout the first half. And we're not asking for a guide, I'm just trying to better reconcile your customers' inventory with your comment. And I have a follow-up. Okay, so Mehdi's first question is on inventory. He notes customers' inventory levels are very high. We have talked about our observation from an industry level that demand is softening in consumer segment. And so his question is what is the outlook and do we expect the inventory correction, I guess, to be more notable as we go into first half '23. Is that correct, Mehdi? Yes, and particularly, you've always had your wafer shipment up in Q2, but I think '23 could be an exception, and it could probably decline. And that's how I explained my question. So the question is could wafer shipment decline in Q2 for the first time in many, many years. Well, Mehdi, our current forecast, actually, our supply chain inventory will peak in third quarter this year. And we observed that the inventory will start to reduce in the fourth quarter -- last quarter of this year. And we expect we will see the biggest impact in the first half, actually, first half of 2023. The detail of the first quarter, second quarter or something like that, we are not ready to share with you yet because of -- we continue to work with our customer and to understand their demand. And if I may have a quick follow-up to that? Does that imply that your customer focus changing so rapidly that we have to wait for January pulse to get the final read on the first half? No, Mehdi. I think we have always in the past, we will guide for 2023 and talk about 2023 outlook in first quarter during the January conference, right? But I think C.C. has already said that with the inventory correction, we expect our business to be more resilient during both the down and upturn given our technology leadership, and that 2023 is a growth year for TSMC, okay? We will not comment further on first quarter or second quarter. And my second question has to do with depreciation that was down in Q3, down year-over-year and Q-over-Q. And this is despite the fact that CapEx was up 65% in 2021. Does that have anything to do with tool optimization? And to that extent, as the second part of the question, would you consider converting 7-nanometer to 5 and 3? So, Mehdi’s, second question first is depreciation, why it is down Q-on-Q and year-on-year. And then also, would we consider converting capacity? Okay. Mehdi, the depreciation, we look at it from a whole year point of view. For this year, as I mentioned, we expect it to be up year-on-year by mid-single digits of -- and for next year, it will be meaningfully higher, meaningfully higher, but we will share with you more in January. Please understand that every year, there are depreciation newly going into the depreciation table and also there are depreciation coming off of the depreciation table. So what you're looking at is the net result.
As to converting N7 capacity to N5, as we mentioned earlier, N7 demand issue is cyclical rather than structural. So at this moment, I don't think we have that kind of plan. Thank you, Mehdi. In the interest of time, operator, maybe we can take the last -- the questions from the last two participants, please? Yes, sir. Next one to ask a question, Patrick Chen from CLSA. Go ahead, please. Thank you for taking my questions. You talked about 2023 to be still a growth year. Would you say that growth is pretty much the same compared to what you expected a quarter ago or it is lower? And if so, what's driving this lower growth expectation? Okay, so Patrick's first question is about 2023. Is the growth that we see for 2023, how does it compare versus our expectation for 3 months ago for 2023? And what is driving this? Yes, well, I think it's too early to talk too much about the 2023, but we maintain our statement that 2023, we still expect as a growth year, okay? Do you have a second question, Patrick? Okay. Yes, that’s very helpful. And maybe a follow-up. If I may, any leading indicators that you are monitoring that could help you or help us determine the growth outlook aside from monitoring the clients' wafer orders? Okay, so Patrick's second question is looking with inventory correction. He wants to know if there's any leading indicators that we can look at or he should look at to see when indication that the cycle is bottoming. That's really hard to answer your question. Actually, if you look at the whole industry, that's from the smartphone and PCs, and you read all the quarterly report from our major player, you can change that one to go up and one is the downturn. So we definitely have some information. Internally, we do the analysis, and today, we are taking a very conservative way for our planning. That's all I can share with you. Thank you. And I guess that's what we've been doing as well. But obviously, we don't have a crystal ball. Well I don’t have any further question. Thank you for taking my questions. Okay, thank you. Operator, can we take the last participant, please? Yes, the last one to ask question is Frank Lee from HSBC. Go ahead, please. Thank you. I wanted to ask, I guess, a question on your N3, N3E. Is the ramp for both nodes going to be around the same time, or is there going to be some difference in scheduling? Okay, so Frank's first question is on the ramp for N3 versus N3E, is it at the same time. Okay. Actually, it's not at the same time. Right now, we are ramping up by N3. And N3E is supposed to be one-year apart, but because of the progress so well, so we might pull in a little bit for 2 or 3 months, that's all. So they are still not at the same time. Okay, and my second question is, I know you've related your margin -- long-term gross margin target being unchanged. But I guess given the headwinds you're seeing now through the first half of next year with the currency move already gone up quite a bit, utilization rates dropping. Is this -- are you going to see any potential change in the pricing strategy? I know I can't comment too specifically, but you have seen some price increases in the last 12 months or so. So from going forward, with the pricing strategy still be relatively unchanged given the change in the overall market environment? Okay, so Frank's second question is related to pricing with the inventory correction and with some of the cost challenges, he wants to know, will there be any changes to our pricing strategy during this correction. Is that correct Frank? Yes. Okay, frank, let me answer the question. Again, I want to stress that our pricing actually is a strategic and consistent. So you say that do we have any plan to change it? No, it will be consistent. And not based on any cycle or opportunistic. And we actually -- most importantly, we always work closely with our customers to provide our value and to help them to win their own end markets. Right -- no, I'm not suggesting there's an opportunistic pricing, but I just get a market situation has changed for your clients who are probably going through a more difficult time. Would there be some change to the strides to help align with them as well? Or would they largely still be the same policy that we've seen? We stay the same. We are consistent. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Frank. All right. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within one hour from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. Thank you for joining us today, and we hope you will join us again next quarter.

Please refer to the Safe Harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now, I would like to turn the call over to TSMC’s CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2023.
First quarter revenue decreased 1.5% sequentially in U.S. dollar terms as our business was dampened by the end market demand softness and customers’ inventory adjustment despite the continued ramp up of our industry leading 5-nanometer technologies. It is at the low end of our previous guidance. In NT dollar terms, revenue increased 2% in the fourth quarter due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 62.2% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. Total operating expenses accounted for 10.3% of net revenue. Operating margin was 52%, up 1.4 percentage points from the previous quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD11.41 and ROE was 41.7%.
Now, let’s move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 32% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 22%. Advanced Technologies defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 54% of wafer revenue. On a full year basis, 5-nanometer technology contributed 26% of 2022 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 27%. Advanced Technologies accounted for 53% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2021.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 10% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 4% to account for 38%, IoT decreased 11% to account for 8%, automotive increased 10% to account for 6% and DCE decreased 23% to account for 2%. On a full year basis, all 6 platforms had year-on-year growth. HPC increased 59% year-on-year to account for 41% of our 2022 revenue. Smartphone increased 28% to account for 39%, IoT increased 47% to account for 9%, automotive increased 74% to account for 5%, and DCE increased 1% to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.56 trillion or $51 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD137 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD48 billion in accounts payable, an increase of TWD93 billion in accrued liabilities and others. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remain at 36 days while days of inventory increased 3 days to 93 days.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx, during the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD487 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD337 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD71 billion for first quarter 2022 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD47 billion to TWD1.34 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $10.82 billion.
To recap our performance in 2022, we had a strong growth in 2022 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry’s megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 33.5% in U.S. dollar terms to reach $76 billion and 42.6% in NT terms to reach TWD2.26 trillion. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points to 59.6%, mainly reflecting a more favorable foreign exchange rate, value-selling efforts and cost improvement, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. Thanks to better operating leverage, operating margin increased 8.6 percentage points to 49.5%.
Overall, full year EPS increased 70.4% to TWD39.2 and ROE was 39.8%. On cash flow, we spent $36.3 billion or TWD1.1 trillion in CapEx. We generated TWD1.6 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD528 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD285 billion in cash dividends in 2022, up from TWD266 billion in 2021. I have finished my financial summary.
Now, let’s turn to our current quarter guidance. As overall macroeconomic conditions remain weak, we expect our business to be further impacted by continued end market demand softness and customers’ further inventory adjustment. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion, representing a 14.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD30.7, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 41.5% and 43.5%. Starting in 2023, certain tax exemptions from the Taiwan government have expired. However, the government has recently passed the amendments to the statute for industrial innovations. All things considered, we expect our effective tax rate in 2023 and beyond to be approximately 15%. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our fourth quarter ‘22 and first quarter ‘23 profitability. Compared to third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin increased by 180 basis points sequentially to 62.2%, of which 140 basis points was contributed by a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Meanwhile, cost improvement efforts also helped offset the impact from lower capacity utilization. Compared to our fourth quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high-end of the range provided 3 months ago, mainly due to cost improvement efforts.
We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to be 54.5% at the midpoint mainly due to a lower capacity utilization rate as customers further adjust their inventory levels and a less favorable foreign exchange rate. In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of entry, overseas fab expansion and inflationary cost.
In addition, R&D expenses accounted for 7.2% of our net revenue in 2022. In 2023, we as we increase our focus on technology development and add more resources, we expect R&D expenses to increase by about 20% year-on-year and account for 8% to 8.5% of our net revenue. To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to strategically and consistently sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our 2023 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As I have stated before, given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customers’ structural growth remains unchanged and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile.
In 2022, we spent $36.3 billion to capture the structural demand and support our customers’ growth. In 2023, our capital budget is expected to be between $32 billion and $36 billion. Out of the $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx for 2023, about 70% will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, mass making and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately 30% year-over-year in 2023 mainly as we ramp our 3-nanometer technologies.
With this level of CapEx spending in 2023, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.
Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2023 outlook.
Concluding 2022, the semiconductor industry growth excluding memory, was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 27% year-over-year. TSMC’s revenue grew $33.5 million year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. Our business was supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, even as our semiconductor inventory correction began to dampen the momentum in second half 2022. Entering 2023, we continue to observe softness in consumer end market segment, while other end market segments such as data center related have softened as well.
As customers and the supply chain continue to take action, we forecast a semiconductor supply chain inventory, while reduced sharply through first half 2023, to rebalance to a healthier level. In the first half of 2023, we expect our revenue to decline mid to high single-digit percent over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms. Having said that, we also start to observe some initial signs of demand stabilization and we will watch closely for more signals. We forecast the semiconductor cycle to bottom sometimes in first half 2023 and to see a healthy recovery in second half this year. In the second half of 2023, we expect our revenue to increase over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms.
For the full year of 2023, we forecast the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline approximately 4%, while foundry industry is forecast to decline 3%. For TSMC, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we will continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market and we expect 2023 to be a slight growth year for TSMC in U.S. data terms.
Next, let me talk about the N7, N6 demand outlook. 3 months ago, we set our N7, N6 capacity utilization in first half ‘23 will not be as high as it has been in the past 3 years due to end market weakness in smartphone and PCs and customer’s product schedule delay. Since then, the end market demand for smartphone and PCs has further weakened and the capacity utilization of N7, N6 is lower than our expectation 3 months ago. We expect this to persist through first half ‘23 as our semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level and we expect a mild pickup in our N7, N6 demand in second half 2013 than our prior expectation.
However, we continue to believe N7, N6 demand is more a cyclical issue rather than structural. We are working closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technologies to drive additional wave of structural demand from consumer, RF, connectivity and other applications to backfill our N7, N6 capacity over the next several years. Thus, we are confident our 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now, I will talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our N3 has successfully entered volume production in late fourth quarter last year as planned with good yield. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023 driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. As our customers’ demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect the N3 to be fully utilized in 2023. Sizable N3 revenue contribution, we expect to start in third quarter ‘23 and N3 will contribute mid single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. We expect the N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its fourth year in 2020.
N3E will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. Volume production is scheduled for second half ‘23. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both the N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in its first and second year. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology, thus, we expect customers a strong demand in 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond for our 3-nanometer technologies and are confident that our N3 family will be another large and non-large node for TSMC.
Finally, let me talk about our plans to expand TSMC’s global manufacturing footprint to increase customers’ trust and expand our future growth potential. TSMC submission is to be trusted technology and capacity provider for the global IC, logic IC industry for years to come. Our job is to provide the optimal solutions for our customers to enable their success, this including technology leadership, manufacturing, cost, trust and recently also including more geographic manufacturing flexibility.
Based on customers’ request, we are increasing our capacity outside of Taiwan to continue to provide our customers the optimal solution they need to be successful. TSMC’s decisions are based on our customers’ need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. Our decisions are also based on the talent pool, land, electricity and water needs for TSMC’s long-term growth.
In the U.S., we are in the process of building two advanced semiconductor fabs in Arizona. Our U.S. customers welcome us to build capacity in the U.S. to support their needs and have placed their strong commitment and support. We had an opening ceremony on December 6 last year to celebrate the arrival of the fourth batch of state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment and Fab 1 is on track to begin production of N4 process technology in 2024.
We also announced the construction of a second fab, which is scheduled to begin production of 3-nanometer process technology in 2026. TSMC Arizona will continue to provide the most advanced semiconductor technology commercially available in the U.S., enabling next-generation, high-performance and low-power computing products in the future years. Each of our fab will have a clean-room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logic fab.
We will also consider building additional mature node capacity outside of Taiwan. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab, which will utilize 12 and 16-nanometer and 22, 28-process technologies. Volume production is scheduled for late 2024. We are also considering building a second fab in Japan as long as the demand from customers and the level of government support makes sense.
In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab, focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from customers and level of government support. In China, we expand 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support local customers and we continue to follow all the rules and regulation fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customer’s growth. Our N3 has just entered volume production in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing for N2 volume production starting in 2025, which will be located in Chengdu and Taichung Science Park.
While capacity is not born overnight and takes time to build, we are committed to expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust and expand our future growth potential. Depending on the demand from customers and level of government support, our 28-nanometer and below overseas capacity could be 20% or more of our total 28 and below capacity in 5 years or more time. While initial cost of overseas fab are higher than TSMC software in Taiwan, our goal is – and minimize the cost gap.
Our pricing will remain strategic to reflect our value, which also including the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we are leveraging our competitive advantage of lost volume, economies of scale and manufacturing technology leadership to continuously drive cost down. We will also continue to work closely with our government to secure their support. By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs while remaining the most efficient and cost effective manufacturer, no matter where we operate. Even we increased our capacity outside of Taiwan, we believe long-term gross margin of 53% and higher continue to be achievable and we can earn a sustainable and healthy ROE of greater than 25%, while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. This concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C. C. This concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Now we will begin the Q&A session. Our Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will be the host. Hello, everyone. It’s good to meet every one of you online again. At the beginning of the year, I wish you all stay healthy and have a happy new year. Now, let’s have answer your question. Thank you, Chairman. Operator, let’s begin. Please proceed with the first caller on the line. Thank you. The first question is come from Randy Abrams with Credit Suisse. And Randy, please go ahead. Okay. Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask the first question just about the rising investment costs and also the cost differential with the U.S. Just based on the two press releases, the Taiwan fab, you cited Fab 18, about $60 billion investment for eight phases, which would be, I estimate about 200,000 capacity, that’s about $300 million per thousand wafer. The Arizona fab was $40 billion for about 50,000, $800 million per thousand wafers. So, just two questions on it. If you could maybe discuss a bit more if there is differences in those releases on the investment in calculation and a bit more color on the relative costs since you did the U.S. expansion? And then the second part of the question is, is the cost seeing a significant acceleration? It’s been rising with each new node. But are you seeing an accelerating pace as you move through 3 and 2-nanometer? Okay. Randy, thank you. Please allow me to summarize your question. So Randy’s first question is he wants to understand, I think, he’s referring, I think, to our press release when we – about N3 in Tainan and the total investment there, and how does that compare to our announcement of the investment in Arizona for two phases. Randy, if I got you correctly, basically what Randy is asking is, what is the cost in the U.S. seem much higher in terms of the investment? So what is driving this big difference or a gap, so to speak. That’s the first part of your question, right, Randy. Okay. So that’s the first part. Right. Yes, that’s right. That’s the first part. Okay. Hi, Randy, this is Wendell. Let me share with you this. The Arizona fab, we make the decision based on customers’ request. And so we’re planning on building the two fabs, one N5, actually N4 and the other one N3. We’re not able to share with you a specific cost gap number between Taiwan and U.S., but we can share with you that the major reason for the cost gap is the construction cost of building and facilities, which can be 4 to 5x greater for U.S. fab versus a fab in Taiwan. The high cost of construction includes labor cost, cost of permits, cost of occupational safety and health regulations, inflationary costs in recent years and people and learning curve costs. Therefore, the initial cost of overseas fabs are higher than our fabs in Taiwan. And I think the second part of Randy’s question was about the – how do we see the CapEx per K as we go from, I guess, Randy, you’re asking N5, N3 and 2. Yes, it’s seeing a faster pace of expansion through these next couple of nodes. Right. Randy, we’re not able to disclose the specific CapEx per K for each node, but certainly, the CapEx is, K is more expensive for a new node as the process capacity increases. Okay? Okay. And the second question, just on actually two areas that came up in the remarks. The R&D, the over 20% increase. If you could give a feel like what’s mainly driving that additional step up, is it the development cost for the new nodes, the packaging? Or is it some now expanding R&D into new geographic areas? And if I can fit in the second part, just the tax rate, Taiwan was hyping a pretty big program of CapEx and R&D, but tax breaks, but your tax rate is going up from 11% to 15%. Is that alternative minimum tax or global tax? Just want to understand why not any benefit from that? Okay. So Randy’s second question, I guess, is sort of two parts financial related. First, we – our CFO said, our R&D spending will increase about 20% year-on-year. So Randy wants to know what is driving behind that? Is it customer going overseas? Is it more technology development as a technology leader, etcetera? And then the second part, he wants to understand the guidance of effective tax rate of 15% given the recent legislation passed in Taiwan. Why is it not lower? Okay. Randy, for the first question, we’re the technology leader, and we intend to continue to maintain the leadership. Therefore, we are devoting more and more resources in R&D, including people and other kind of resource. That’s the reason why our R&D expense will increase in 2023 and probably beyond. The other thing about tax in 2023, part of the tax exemptions – or incentives in Taiwan have expired. Without the new amendments to this industrial innovation, the statute of industrial innovation, our tax rate would have become between 18% to 19%. With this new amendment, our tax rates will drop to about 15%. Okay. Does that answer your question, Randy? Yes, that does, I mean this mid-term R&D do you think the rate stays at this level or could go up one more? That’s my final one. Thank you. From what we are seeing at this moment, we expect the R&D to revenue ratio to be between 8% to 8.5% in the next several years. Okay, thank you, Wendell. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Sure. And our next question is come from Bruce Lu with Goldman Sachs. Bruce, please go ahead. Okay, thank you for taking my question. The first question is focused on the overseas capacity expansion. So I think you just mentioned that even though we cannot disclose it, but the cost is definitely higher for the overseas capacity, but the management believes that the margin will stay the same. So I mean – I think I asked this question back to 2019, the manager was talking about the pricing will be the same across the board regardless of geographical locations. So what has changed now? So with the different pricing, can we say the overseas capacity will generate a similar return on profitability throughout the cycle? So – or what is the benchmark you’re looking for when you set of the different pricing scheme? Okay. So Bruce from Goldman Sachs actually, his question is regarding – first question regarding overseas expansion. His question is we said overseas costs are higher, yet that – so his question is in regards to our pricing. Are we a higher price overseas? Or if it’s overall? And what is the benchmark that we use when we go overseas in terms of financial returns and price? Is that roughly correct, Bruce? Yes, that’s correct. Okay, Bruce, this is Wendell, we’re not able to comment on pricing details, but our pricing is always strategic and consistent to reflect our value. Now value to our customers as C. C. said in this statement includes technology leadership, manufacturing efficiency and quality, cost, trust and recently also includes more geographic manufacturing facilities. Therefore, our overall pricing will remain strategic to reflect our value, which includes the value of geographic flexibilities. Does that answer your question? Well, to some extent. Let me ask the question in different ways is that we do understand it will reflect TSMC’s value, i.e., geographical location is a bad, but at the end of the day, it’s a cost plus for everybody across the board. I mean, how confident that TSMC feels that the customers can swallow all the cost and the end customer with one of the costs, i.e., without triggering the potential wafer price inflation or semiconductor inflation at the end of the day with more and more global capacity for TSMC. Yes. Okay. Bruce, let me add that in C. C.’s statement, he also mentioned that we will – aside from selling our value, we will continue to drive down our cost, but also to leverage our competitive advantages of large volume, economy of scale and manufacturing technology leadership. And with all these actions plus the government support, we are able to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs and maintain our long-term financial goals, gross margin of 53% and higher. Let me add some color. this is C. C. Wei. Actually, in our view, the semiconductor becomes more essential and more pervasive in people’s life. And the semiconductor industry value in the supply chain is increasing. And if we look at our customers’ performance, they are rising structural gross margin over the past 5 to 6 years, it continued to improve. That reflects what I just said, the semiconductor value has been recognized and also very important in our daily life. And so we set up our pricing strategy to reflect all the values we share to customer and customer also in the value from the end market. Thank you, C. C. Bruce? Do you have a second question? Yes, please. The second question is for the N7. I think we spent some time for 7-nanometer, which is more cyclical. I think after 3 months, I think the correction is even bigger. So how – can you share us the full year outlook for 7-nanometer? When we can expect the customer or the 7-nanometer capacity return to normal back to like fully utilized? Or can we avoid the same cyclical symptom in 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer in 2, 3 years from now? Okay. So Bruce’s second question was on 7-nanometer. So his question is 7-nanometer seems to have deteriorated versus 3 months ago. So what is our view? Can it fully recover in this year? And then I think, Bruce, the second part of your question is also how can we avoid the same cyclical systems at other nodes in the future. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. So I answer this one? First, N7 most of business for TSMC in the last 2 years is from the PC and smartphone. And that happened to correct – or let me say that inventory correct happened to be the most severe one. And so the end market dropped most severely generally thought. In fact, the unit will not increase, but the content will be increased, so is demand be more softened than we thought 3 months ago? Why be repeated at 5 or 3? Cyclicality of the semiconductor always exist, but it’s unlikely this time the scenario was to be repeated because our current downturn actually, it’s kind of being enhanced or being degraded by the pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the digital transformation progress have been enhanced. And so the demand being increased dramatically. But then due to the pandemic, the supply chain disruption happened. And people during this time, probably changed their strategy or their thoughts on the inventory buildup. So artificially, the inventory has been built up quickly and dramatically. And then the response to the each industry are different. And so they manage the inventory correction also differently. This kind of phenomenon all because of – largely because of pandemic, and we don’t think that it will happen again. And in the next 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer, I believe TSMC and TSMC’s customer will be more prudent on planning that what is the demand and also the supply. Okay. Bruce, does that answer your second question? Yes, let me follow-up a little bit. I mean C. C. just mentioned external factors, right? So what did TSMC do to avoid the same thing for 5 and 3 in the future for someone like if you are cutting your capacity plan into a more conservative way or something like that? Is that something we should expect in future nodes? So Bruce is asking sort of a follow-on. So then with 7-nanometer, how do we avoid the same thing happening at 5 or 3 in the future? Will we cut our capacity? How do we change our capacity planning and build to avoid a similar situation? Bruce, this is a very good question. Actually, let me share with you how we deal with it. In fact, between the N5, N3, the technology node our capacity buildup and with a lot of tools that can be company used by these two nodes. So in fact, for TSMC to build capacity, we put N5, N3 and maybe in the future N2 as a total picture to look at it. And we will keep our flexibility to create or to adjust for the future. So we will be better prepared. That’s what I can tell you. That’s good to hear. Thank you. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Sure. And our next question is come from Gokul Hariharan with JPMorgan. And Gokul, please go ahead. Hey, thanks. Happy new year. And let me take my first question on the near-term 2023. So you mentioned first half, we have seen a worse kind of environment compared to 3 months back. Is it mainly HPC data center that has seen further reduction? Or are we seeing it across the board, including smartphone for first half? And also on second half, just putting in rough numbers on your guidance, looks like we are looking for a pretty sharp rebound in second half of 2023, something like 25% to 30% second half versus first half of this year. Could we have some more color on what is that gives you the confidence for such a strong rebound in the second half of the year to get us back to like a flattish revenue growth for the year? Okay. So Gokul’s first question is on the near-term outlook. He wants to understand first half, we said the inventory correction in sharper. So he wants to understand what are we seeing in different end market segments? Is the sharper correction driven by data center? Is it smartphone PC? What are we seeing across the different segments first? Well, let me answer the question. The inventory correction actually began last year. And at the peak of the third quarter, and we think the inventory has been picked in third quarter last year and gradually reduced in the fourth quarter, and we did see some inventory reduced sharply recently, and it will continue to be so to first half of this year. So that’s why we say we have confidence that in the second half, the business will rebound. But is that a very strong V shape? We didn’t know yet, but certainly, it’s not a U shape for the business to recover in the second half. Okay. I think N3 is clearly one part of that ramp. But is there anything else that is – that you are already seeing that strong confidence for the second half rebound in addition to the N3 ramp-up? Sorry. So Gokul is asking sort of in terms of second half, why can TSMC’s business be better than the overall industry besides N3. Are there any other factors when you think about technology leadership? Gokul, you are right. enters a ramp-up here of the business to rebound, and also actually, let me share with you some of the HPC customer. Also, I have a new product launch in the second half, especially in the AI area or in computing area. Did that answer your question? Understood. Okay, thank you. That’s my first question. Jeff, can I move on to the second one? Yes, please. Yes, thank you. My second question is on CapEx and capital intensity. CapEx, we are taking it down a notch for this year given the downturn, I guess, and some conservatism. Are we already seeing the peak in CapEx intensity in the cycle? Or we are likely to given the plans in Europe plans to expand more capacity in U.S.? Are we likely to see higher CapEx intensity in the out years as well? Okay. Sorry. Is that your okay, Gokul. I think I got the gist of your question. So Gokul’s second question is on CapEx and capital intensity. He notes this year, we have guided 32% to 36% given sort of some tightening up and such. So his question is – does this represent, have we already seen or past the peak in terms of our capital intensity this cycle, or as we may continue to evaluate and expand overseas and such? Will there be another step-up in our capital intensity? Okay. Gokul, this is Wendell. As we said before, we invest the CapEx this year for the growth in the future years. So we also said earlier that we are tightening up the spending where appropriate. But as long as we believe the growth opportunity is there, we will continue to invest. Now we’ve given the guidance for this year, so you can calculate the capital intensity. It will be over 40%. From what we are able to see at this moment, several years down the road, we’re seeing the CapEx intensity to be between mid to high 30s. That’s the current view. Thanks, Wendell. Is that several years like 5 years out or is it like close to like that? Yes. Something like that. Something like that. Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Alright. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next participant. Thank you. And our next question is come from Charlie Chan with Morgan Stanley. And Charlie, please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions, gentlemen. So first of all, a question to C. C. And so thanks for your sharing during the [indiscernible] association, presentation on semiconductor challenge was pretty insightful. So my question is that you mentioned during your speech saying that the biggest change for semiconductor cost is getting higher, better long so-called [indiscernible] supply chain. So I wanted to ask C. C., what’s the true value add of worth low going forward becomes much more expensive and whether you really see that customers can continue to expand our gross margin and create value to this world. So this is my first question. Thank you. Okay. So Charlie’s first question is around technology. He notes that the cost, I guess, and cost per transistor is getting higher and overall global costs are increasing as well. So his question is, what is the value or is there still value in the so-called Moore’s Law going forward? How does TSMC view this issue? Well, Charlie, let me share with you, nowadays, we look at our technologies value not only geometries shrinkage actually. More important actually is the power consumption efficiency. And also, we try to help our customers with our advanced 3D IC Fabric technology to improve the system performance, and that’s where it’s important. In the future, we want the world to be more greener more safer, better. So power consumption needs become very, very important. And while we still improve the system performance and that’s where our customer can get their value. And that’s what we view in the future. Thank you. Thanks for the explanation. So the follow-up to that is that we noticed that for your major smartphone SoC customers, they seem to slow down the migration to the newer nodes, right, or so-called bifurcation for their new SoC adoption. So do you think for mobile computing, particularly do you think a value-add is diminishing based on what you just said. And also another structural trend we are seeing is about the cost of chip by ASIC in HPC segment. So can management talk about that part of business, meaning the ASIC design themselves of total revenue contribution in HPC and the growth rate of the 8-figure business? Thank you. Okay. So Charlie, I’m going to interpret. So he has a follow-up to his first question and then his second question. So the follow-up to his first question is then in terms of going back to cost again, do we see any sign of slowdown in smartphone SoC migration at the leading node. That’s his follow-up. And then his second question is then do we see more companies designing ASICs? And can we disclose the revenue contribution from such customers? Correct, Charlie? Yes, correct, please. Okay. Charlie, let me answer your question. In fact, we do not see any slowdown on our customer to adopt the TSMC’s leading-edge technology. Actually, they might have a different kind of product schedule. They might have a different kind of product plan and etcetera. But the technology adoption, actually, it did not slow down. That’s my answer to your first follow-up question. And the whether that some kind of customer, some of the hyperscale customers want to develop their own chip. Yes, but I cannot give you more information than that. However, I can tell you that they also look at compute for their own business, the positioning for the opportunity actually increase our opportunity. And that requires TSMC is a leading-edge technology. So we do have quite a few hyperscale customers working with TSMC to develop their own chips. Okay, thank you. And would that cannibalize your merchant business, for example, those on change CPU, GPU are they going to be replaced or impacted by those custom design growth? If I may? Okay. Last question, Charlie is asking then his concern is that any hyperscalers are developing will that cannibalize business for other types of companies? I cannot comment, but I don’t think so. They also developed the specific purpose for own I mean it’s not a kind of to replace, generalize the purpose of CPU, GPU, all those kind of things. And I think also for TSMC, we’re happy to work with all types of customers, whatever type they may be. Okay, thank you, Charlie. Let’s move on to the next participant. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question is come from Sunny Lin with UBS. And Sunny, please go ahead. Sure. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is on the SoC ramp up and so if we look at the share revenue could be higher than 5-nanometer for the first year. But if we look at the sales contribution as a percentage of total sales, it’s actually a bit lower. And so I wonder for this year, perhaps there is some market issue. But looking into 2024 and 2025 based on your current customer engagement, should we model a faster ramp up into 2024 or 2025 or its overall ramp-up could be slower because of maybe customer schedule issues or planning? And if we think about the peak revenue contribution for 3-nanometer over time, do you think you will be able to reach 30% range, as N5 and N7. That’s the first question. Thank you. Okay. Sunny’s first question is on 3-nanometer. She notes 3-nanometer revenue is greater than 5-nanometer in its first year, but the revenue percentage contribution of mid-single digit is smaller or lower. So she’s wondering why is that. Is it because the market slowed down? Is it less customer adoption and interest? What is the reason behind that? And does that mean what is our expectation for that ramp to continue? [Technical Difficulty] N3, N3E the number of tape-outs more than double that N5 in the first and the second year. So as a result, we expect the strong demand will continue in 2023, ‘24, ‘25 and beyond, for our N3 technologies driven by both the HPC and smartphone applications. Yes. Okay. Yes, does that answer... Got it. Yes, partially. So any thoughts on the potential peak revenue contribution in the next couple of years? Too early to talk about that N3, but we continue to believe that it will be a large and long-lasting node for us. It will be an important contributor to our 15% to 20% revenue CAGR in the next several years. Got it. Thank you. My second question is a quick one. And so for you to growth for the share, just wonder what kind of industry growth are you assuming for the major end markets, including smartphone, PC, server, automotive? Okay. Sunny, second question is TSMC. We have said we will grow – have slight growth year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms this year. Her question is what are we assuming for the end market growth in areas like smartphones, PCs, automotive and others? Well, let me answer the question, Sunny. What we look at in 2023, actually, we look at the smartphone and PC unit, we think it’s a little bit drop in terms of units. And the content will continue to increase. And for TSMC, actually, we increased our product portfolio. We also extend our market segment – available market segment to TSMC, so that’s why we expect the whole industry to drop slightly and TSMC still grow slightly. Sunny, did that… Sorry. Yes. So, just a quick follow-up on server and automotive. So, any expectations on server units for this year? And for auto, I think October earnings call, you mentioned there could be some slowdown going to first half of the year. Have you started to see the deceleration? That’s all my questions. Thank you very much. Okay. So, Sunny also wants to know what is our forecast for server units, automotive units, and then we said in October, three months ago, we said automotive demand was holding steady. What is the case now? Well, the automotive demand continued to be very tight. I meant that – I mean demand continued to increase actually. And today, we are still probably not 100% supply enough wafers to them. But it’s improving, and we expect the automotive to – the shortage to be relaxed quickly. And the units, for the units to grow, we expect the automotive to grow this year, but that’s OEM stuff. Okay. Thank you, Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant. Thank you very much. Thank you. Operator, can we move on to the next participant. Sure. Our next question is come from Laura Chen with Citigroup. And Laura, please go ahead. Hello. Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first question is also about the overseas expansion. Like C. C. mentioned that the overseas more advanced than 20-nanometer, we account for 20% in the longer term perspective. And also, we are expanding more in the advancement in the U.S. I am just wondering that will you also expand more like second or the advanced packaging, along with your advanced now say like 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer in Arizona as well. Okay. So, Laura’s first question is actually, C. C. said the 20-nanometer below capacity could be 20% and more in several years’ time depending on customer demand and government support. But her question is, would we consider expanding advanced packaging overseas as well? Well, today, we actually don’t have a plan, but we do not rule out the possibility because the back end is a part of the total wafer service for our customer, okay. Okay. Got it. And because we see that a lot of advanced now used for the high-computing PC, so along with that kind of application, we see now TSMC is very to that both 3D IC or the advanced packaging. So, I am just wondering that longer term perspective, whether that is also the direction in the U.S. So, I think what Laura is saying because, of course, that TSMC 3D IC solutions leading and HPC adoption is strong. So, with advanced technologies, will there be a need to build or have packaging in the U.S. as we move advanced technology portion to the U.S.? Alright. Laura, I just answer that we don’t rule out the possibility. But today, we don’t have a plan yet. Sure. Thank you very much. And my second question is about the gain around roadmap. Can you give us more color on the current progress? We know that we have the schedule to ramping up in 2025 versus the EUV, the high-voltage equipment will probably only ready then. Do you think that could be any like potential pushback to like a 2026 onward? Okay. So, Laura’s second question is on the nanosheet transistor structure. She wants to know what is the progress for TSMC as we are adopting nanosheet structure at our N2. Will this be impacted or pushed out by the availability of things such as, I think you are asking high NA, Laura and things like that, correct? Right. Thank you. Okay. Actually, our N2 technology development is on track, actually is better than what we thought. We have very good progress recently, and our risk production will be in 2024 and volume production in 2025. The schedule is not changed if we don’t put it in, but so far so good, let me assure you that. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. Thank you. And our next question has come from Rolf Bulk with New Street Research and please go ahead. Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I had a question on your 2023 CapEx budget and your fab build-out plan. You, earlier on in the conference call, you talked about the build-out cost of hats in the U.S. being 5x higher versus Taiwan. And in that context, I was wondering if you could talk about the share of CapEx spending that you expect to go towards that build-out versus equipment this year versus last year? Will the larger share of CapEx go to those fab build-outs and if so, how much more? Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Rolf, let me try to summarize your first question. His first question is on our CapEx in 2023, and our fab build-out plans. I believe Rolf, you are referring to fab build-out plans overseas, correct? Yes, exactly. What I am trying to understand is if I think about your CapEx such as for this year versus last year, what share will go towards infrastructure of that build-out, what percentage will go to equipment roughly? Okay. So, Rolf wants to know for our CapEx, how much is going to building and facilities, how much is your tools? Rolf, I want to make one correction when our CFO said that the, when you refer to 5x greater, I think our CFO was saying the construction costs are 4x to 5x higher, not the CapEx cost, but nonetheless, Rolf is asking for a breakout, of the CapEx? Well, Rolf, we provide the breakdown of CapEx per year, advanced versus specialty technology, but we do not provide the breakdown between tools and constructions. But as I have said, in the U.S., the construction of building and facilities is probably 5x that of Taiwan. And it lasts for a few years, right. Okay. Rolf, do you have a second question? Sorry. Okay. Thank you very much. Yes, as the second question. Could you talk about the growth that you achieved in your Advanced Packaging segment in 2022? And what growth you are expecting in 2023? And in particular, could you talk about your SoIC products and whether interest in those products is accelerating? Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Rolf. So, Rolf’s second question is on the advanced packaging business. What was the growth in advanced packaging last year? And what do we expect the growth to be this year? And then also more specifically in terms of our SoIC technology, what is the outlook or the momentum there? Okay. Rolf, this is Wendell again. In 2022, our advanced packaging grew at a similar rate to our corporate rate. So, it accounted for about 7% of our total revenue in 2022. And we think that in this year, the growth will be also similar pretty – well, slightly lower than the corporate, it will be probably flattish for the back end. Okay. Thank you, Rolf. Alright, in the interest of… Thank you very much. Thank you. In the interest of time, maybe we will take questions from the last three participants. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. Sure. The next question is come from Charles Shi with Needham. And Charles, please go ahead. Okay. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to ask a little bit about the 20% R&D expense step-up in this year. Can you provide a little bit more detail what the incremental R&D expenses are going to be directed at? Well, for one thing, if I understand correctly, your N3 R&D team are going to move on to the N+2 [ph] node if we are seeing nanometers current end node, or is there any other incremental R&D spending this year you are expecting to be around design enablement of as packaging, specialty technology. Can you kind of give us a sense where the big step-up is coming from? Thank you. Okay. So, Charles first question is on R&D. He wants to understand or actually more details in terms of the 20% approximately year-on-year increase. What is driving – or the R&D spending going to be focused on? Is it N3? Is it N2? Is it design enablement by specific breakdown? Charles, let me answer your question. All your comments are correct. I mean that is because of a newer technology like N2, N1.4 and also a lot of new teams are more expensive than before. And actually, the technology complexity continued to increase exponentially. So, that’s why we spend much more R&D budget. We want to continue to be number one in the world. So, we continue to invest including the geometric shrinkage, including the new transistor architecture, including the design enablement and including buying the new equipment that all is. Okay. Charles, do you have a second question? Yes, I do. Maybe a second question, I want to ask about specialty technology. Obviously, you expect specialty technology to backfill your 7-nanometer fabs. I think this may be a more common knowledge inside the industry, but I recently spoke to some of your customers who are more on the analog mixed signal side. A lot of them are, I mean driving volumes more from 28-nanometer and above, and they could tell me that the benefit of going to 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer for 7-nanometer is there, but it’s not large as in the past, moving node-to-node. And at the same time, the cost is much higher, and I look at your technology roadmap, specialty technology roadmap, it does seems to me that the specialty technology platforms are not as broad at the 7-nanometer if I compare with the 28-nanometer and above. I just want to get some insights from you. How do you think about the progression of specialty technology going forward, as it seems to me that it’s kind of slowing down a little bit more slowing a little bit down faster for the analog mixed signal customers? Thank you. Charles’ second question is on specialty technology. His observation is that the technology, specialty technology portfolio at 7-nanometer seems not as broad as prior nodes and that the – his question is, do we see the slowing scaling of analog and mixed signal areas in terms of the specialty technology development and moving down to lower nodes or more advanced nodes? Charles, your observation is quite good. Actually, you are right. But then let me share with you a little bit more detail inside. Actually, you are right, for the analog portion or mixed signal portion, we do not need to really move into 7-nanometer or more ones now. But as time goes by, now is more and more computing functionality needed to be added into the product. Let me share with you that one thing like the WiFi, you need a really very high speed to move to the next generation and also the RF. For those kind of things, you need a very high-performance of the computing together with low-power consumption. It is important. And if you want to get the lower power consumption, the only the leading-edge node can give you that kind of opportunities, all the footprint stays the same. Then if you want to have a higher functionality with a lower power consumption, that’s where you have to move into the 7-nanometer or more end node even with the analog product. Did that answer your question? Yes. So, I think this is about the reason that you feel so quite comfortable about 7-nanometer utilization will come back. You said it will mildly come back a little bit in ‘23, but you are still confident ‘24 and forward that the 7-nanometer will also be a very, very long-lasting node for you. You are right. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Thank you, Charles. Operator, let’s move on to the last two participants. Thank you. The next question is come from Brad Lin with Bank of America. And Brad, please go ahead. Hi. Happy New Year. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. One is on the globalization challenge and the other on the mature nodes. So, first of all, we know TSMC is excellent in managing the supply chain and the cluster in Taiwan. However, when we now expand Japan and U.S. footprint with the last of the cluster there, would management please share with us why the strategy is to maintain the strong efficiency and the excellence that TSMC has been delivering? Thank you. Okay. Brad’s first question is on our global footprint. He notes that TSMC has done a good job in terms of supply chain and cluster management. But as we go overseas to U.S. and Japan, how will we continue to ensure that we do a good job? Alright. Okay, let me answer. I think Wendell has answered this question earlier, let me summarize a little bit. TSMC is a service business, not in just pure production. The service depends on the trust from the customers. So, in the past, our trust and service depends on our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and the lowest cost and quality. But recently, the geopolitical development is evolving just in front of us. That 100% in one place cannot suffice our customers’ needs. Therefore, we started the overall global footprint planning. Now of course, the cost will be higher. And I think our team has been focused on how do we do this at the same time, keep our minimum gross margin to be 53% and above. And that is the standard that we decide how the pace of our global expansion going to be, and there are other segments in terms of the space, of course. The global expansion increased the value to our customers and the new geopolitical environment. And therefore, the pricing, how the customer can shoulder the increased cost in terms of pricing. And of course, the – geopolitically, the semiconductor in the U.S. and Japan are all new. So, I believe we are working hard on how to reduce the cost by building up the semiconductor supply ecosystem in U.S. and Japan. And I think indeed, both governments echo are – not just us, also rather other major companies to build a similar capacity in this place to reduce the costs. So, that is the general arrangement we are planning. There is no fixed rate. Of course, the government support will be another factor. And so that is, we are cautiously step-by-step to make sure our shareholders’ value still be kept. Thank you, Chairman. Brad, do you have a second question? Yes. Thank you very much for that juncture. So, my second question is on the three node. And there will be no mature node is investing and generates pretty good progress with TSMC technology leadership. So, while we are expanding overseas, what is the strategy for mature node in the long run, especially China expansion baked by – also by the government subsidies? And also R&D is quite valuable for TSMC. And should we continue to allocate the R&D to mature node when maintaining group pace in testing adds [ph] and advanced packaging? Thank you. Okay. So, Brad, second question, I think maybe to summarize this more on the mature nodes. So, he wants to better understand our strategy on the mature nodes. As we expand our manufacturing footprint and increase capacity outside of Taiwan, what is our strategy for mature nodes? Will we bring mature nodes overseas? What is the product status in China? How are we allocating R&D resources to mature nodes already specialty technology strategies, etcetera? Well, actually, our mature node capacity strategy is very simple. We develop differentiated specialty technology for our customer. In fact, we are working with customers and to define what they need and then what kind of technology that we need to develop. We don’t add any commonly used the large technology per se, but we develop specialty and differentiated and for the long-term, structural market demand, and that’s our current strategy. And because of that, of course, we put R&D’s effort and resources to cooperate with our customer. And so we can generate profitability with reasonable utilization. Okay. Thank you, C. C. Got it. Thank you very much C. C. Thank you very much. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Operator, well, can we move on to the last participant, please? Sure. Our last question is come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International Group and please go ahead. Yes. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. I want to go back to gross margin. I am a little bit confused if you could clarify something. Your wafer shipment in Q4 declined and also FX actually strengthened by a little bit, which should be negative on gross margin. So your cost-cutting efforts must have been greatly exceeding these trends and I want to get a better feel for it, and I have a follow-up? Mehdi’s first question is on gross margin. He is – he notes wafer shipments declined sequentially in the fourth quarter. The – but with the foreign exchange movement, he notes it’s a negative for gross margin. So, he wants to – and then he wants to understand what is the magnitude or rate of cost improvement. Maybe our CFO can clarify some of these, particularly the FX. Right. Our fourth quarter gross margin is 180 basis points higher than that in the third quarter. Foreign exchange rate actually went towards our favor. The NT depreciated in the fourth quarter from TWD32 in the third quarter to TWD31, TWD39, so that gave us about 140 basis points of gross margin expansion. Now, the remaining one, there are cost improvement but offset by, as we said, lower wafer utilization. Okay. So, the volume helped. Now, if I just take your comment about the first half, declining 5% to 10% on a year-over-year basis, it does imply that there is a chance that revenues in Q2 would decline on a sequential basis. Would that also drive gross margin down on a sequential basis? Okay. So Mehdi’s second question is then we have noted, we did not say 5% to 10%, but our first half revenue will decline mid to high-single digit year-on-year. So, he wants to know does this mean that second quarter revenue will be down sequentially? And is there – does that mean that the gross margin will go below 53% or decline into…? Okay. Right. We give you the guidance, so you can really calculate yourself on the revenue growth on the second quarter. And it’s too early to talk about the gross margin in the second quarter and beyond. However, we can tell you that we work very diligently to make sure our gross – long-term gross margins of 53% and higher is achievable even in this year. Understood. Sure. Understood. But could it go below 53% and then rebound, so it would average to 53%? It’s too early to talk about that. But as I have said, we work very diligently to make sure this long-term gross margin target of 53% and above can be achievable, including this year. And we will give you the second quarter gross margin outlook in April, Mehdi, in three months, okay? Thank you. Alright. Thank you. Okay. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today’s conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 30 minutes from now. The transcript will be available 24 hours from now, both of which you can find and is available through TSMC’s website at www.tsmc.com. Thank you again for joining us today. We wish everyone a happy Lunar New Year and we hope you will join us again next quarter.

TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. [Operator Instructions]. The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2023, followed by our guidance for the second quarter 2023. Afterwards, Mr. Huang, and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for questions and answers.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2023.
First quarter revenue decreased 18.7% sequentially in NT or 16.1% in U.S. dollar as our first quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, which led customers to adjust their demand accordingly. Gross margin decreased 5.9 percentage points sequentially to 56.3%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and a less favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by a more stringent cost controls.
Total operating expenses accounted for 10.8% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance mainly due to stringent expense control and lower employee profit sharing. Operating margin was 45.5%, down 6.5 percentage points from the previous quarter.
Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.98 and ROE was 27.5%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 31% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 20%. Advanced Technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC declined 14% quarter-over-quarter and accounted for 44% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone declined 27% to account for 34%. IoT declined 19% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 7% and DCE decreased 5% to account for 2%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.59 trillion or USD 52 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 71 billion, mainly due to the decrease of TWD 65 billion in accounts payable. On financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 34 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 96 days.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 385 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 302 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for second quarter 2022 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased CNY 42 billion to CNY 1.39 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.94 billion. I have finished my financial summary.
Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the second quarter to continue to be impacted by customers' further inventory adjustment. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between to USD 15.2 billion and USD 16 billion, which represents a 6.7% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.4, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our first quarter '23 and second quarter '23 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter, our first quarter gross margin decreased by 590 basis points sequentially to 56.3% primarily due to a lower capacity utilization. Compared to our first quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago, by 80 basis points, mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts.
We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to be 53% at the midpoint mainly due to a lower capacity utilization rate and higher electricity costs in Taiwan. After last year's electricity price increase of 15% in the second half of 2022, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 17% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 60 basis points from our second quarter gross margin.
We expect the impact from higher electricity costs to continue throughout the second half of this year and dilute our full year gross margin by about 50 basis points. In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion and inflationary costs, including higher utility costs in Taiwan.
To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, which we have no control over, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about 2023 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As I've stated before, given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. Thus we expect our 2023 capital budget to be between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion.
With this level of CapEx spending in 2023, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading edge, and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. 3 months ago, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to start gradually reducing 4Q 2022 and we forecast a sharper reduction throughout the first half of 2023.
However, due to weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand fabless semiconductor inventory continued to increase in the fourth quarter and exited 2022 at a much higher level than we expected. In addition, the recovery in end market demand from channels reopening is also lower than our expectation. Therefore, the fabless semiconductor inventory adjustment in first half '23 is taking longer than our prior expectation. It may extend into third quarter this year before rebalancing to a healthier level.
For the full year of 2023, we do our forecast for the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single-digit percent while foundry industry is forecast to decline high single-digit percent. We now expect our full year 2023 revenue to decline low to mid-single-digit percent in U.S. dollar terms and our business to do better than both semiconductor ex memory and foundry industries, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 6.7 billion, which is towards the low end of our guidance range, provided in U.S. dollar terms.
Moving into second quarter 2023, we expect our business to continue to be impacted by customers for the inventory adjustment. We now expect our revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms as compared to mid- to high single-digit percent decline previously.
Having said that, we believe we are passing through the bottom of the cycle of TSMC business in the second quarter. While we forecast only a gradual recovery, for the semiconductor ex memory industry in second half 2023, TSMC's business in the second half of this year is expected to be stronger than the first half, supported by customers' new product launches.
Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the first in the semiconductor industry to high-volume production with good yield. As our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect N3 to be fully utilized in 2023 supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. Sizable N3 revenue contribution is expected to start in third quarter and N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3 will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and offer complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3E has passed the qualification and achieve performance and yield targets and volume production is scheduled for second half '23. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in the first and second half year -- in the second year, I'm sorry.
Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. Thus we expect customers a strong multi-yield demand for our N3 technologies and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 top neurosis transistor structure to provide our customers with the best performance, cost and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency and our N2 deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. At N2, we are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement from both HPC and the smartphone applications.
Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced, and will further extend our technology leadership well into the future.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's global footprint and talent development status. As we have said before, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. In Arizona, despite some challenges in obtaining permits our fourth fab is scheduled to begin production of N4 processing technology in late 2024. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab the volume production is scheduled for late 2024.
In Europe, we are engaging with customer and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab focusing on automotive specific technologies based on the demand from customers and level of government support. In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support our customer in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulation fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customers' growth.
In Kaohsiung, our fab construction continues, but we have adjusted our previous 28-nanometer expansion plan to now focus on capacity expansion for more advanced nodes, and we will remain flexible going forward. In terms of talent development, a key to TSMC's success is adherence to our core value of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust and our discipline and spirit of working together as 1 team.
In both the U.S. and Japan, we recruiting from the top local colleges and universities and our progress is well on track. We have hired more than 900 US employees today in Arizona and more than 370 in Japan. We also plan to hire more than 6,000 employees in Taiwan in 2023. All of our hirings are to support our future growth potential.
In addition to providing extensive training program for new overseas employees, many of them are brought to Taiwan for [indiscernible] experience in our fabs so that they can further their technical skills, while being emerged in TSMC's operation, environment and culture. As we expand our global footprint, our priority work continue to be identified, attract and hire talent whose core values and principles are aligned with TSMC's so that we can establish TSMC culture in all our employees, no matter where we operate.
This concludes our key message. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]. Now let's begin the Q&A session.
Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? Yes, Jeff. The first one to ask a question, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. First of all, can I talk -- can I ask a bit about the near-term demand dynamics? Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing by segments? Is the inventory correction trend largely similar across HPC, smartphone, IoT and auto? Or are you seeing any different dynamics in these segments, especially auto, you saw some shortage still in the last quarter.
And maybe also talk a little bit about 7-nanometer. Previously, we had an expectation, 7-nanometer will start recovering in second half of this year. Do we think 7-nanometer will still be recovering in second half? That's my first question. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Let me -- please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is more focusing on the near-term dynamics. He wants to know basically about the inventory trend across different segments and also the end demand status across the different segments, including auto. And then also, what about particularly for TSMC 7-nanometer status in terms of the utilization recovery. Okay. Gokul, let me answer the question. We observed the PC and smartphone market continue to be soft at the present time, while automotive demand is holding steady for TSMC and it is showing signs of soften into second half of 2023. I'm talking about automotive. On the other hand, we have recently observed incremental upside in AI-related demand, which the ongoing inventory digestion. What is the second question? The second part is on 7-nanometer. We had really -- previously said 7-nanometer utilization is lower. Do we expect this to pick up or recover in the second half? It will be recovered but slowly. As I said, most of the N6 and N7's technology loading still in HPC and smartphone. However, looking into the future, some of the specialties such as RF, connectivity, WiFi, all those kind of things will start to build up the loading their demand. And we expect in the long term, 7-nanometers loading will become more healthier. Did I answer the question? Yes. That's very clear. My second question, I just wanted to get TSMC's opinion on competitive landscape. Your IDM competitor is getting into foundry. Intel has been claiming that they will be attaining process parity and then process leadership by 2025 and talking about engaging with several fabless companies. How does TSMC see this competitive threat?
And how do you benchmark TSMC N3 and N2, which is coming in 2025 with Intel's offerings over the next, let's say, 2 to 3 years? And maybe I think TSMC has not commented about foundry market share for quite some time. So could you talk a little bit about what you see, N3 market share, in the next couple of years with TSMC now that you're ramping up that node as well. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Let me summate your second question. A lot of it is related to the competitive landscape. I think Gokul's question is specifically in terms of IDM that has been claimed meaning it will achieve process parity in terms of technology with TSMC and absolute process leadership.
So he wants to know and they're also talking about engaging with several large fabless customers. So Gokul would like to know how do we see or comment on this competitive threat. How do we benchmark our N3 or our N2 process technologies versus this IDMs offerings for the next 2 to 3 years. And lastly, if we have any comment on what market share we believe we can achieve. That's a long question. Gokul, this is C.C. Wei again. Let me say that, as usual, we don't comment on our competitors' status, but then we emphasize again on our 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer. Our 3-nanometer is the first in the semiconductor industry to high-volume production. And I believe it is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology.
And for 2-nanometer technology, that was, again, to be the most elegant semiconductor technology in the industry and when we introduce into mass production. And this one, we're fully confident that we will further extend our leadership position well into the future. I support the market share. We are very confident that we continue to have a very high market share. And I cannot tell you that the real number, but very high percentage. Okay. Maybe if I ask C.C. for that,if I ask, is N3 -- your expectation that N3 market share will be higher than N5 at the same time based on what you see today? Very hard to answer your question, but let me say that it's well very similar in a very high percentage. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. The next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I want to ask about for the machine learning AI, which management has been saying that, that is a key growth driver. Can we have more quantitative implication to TSMC? What is the dollar content per server or how big the addressable market for TSMC in 2025? Is the reason new AI or ChatGPT, the business already embedded in your long-term growth target, which is 15% to 20%? Or can we see some incremental upside? Okay. Bruce, thank you. So Bruce's first question is around, I guess, AI and machine learning. He wants to know if we have any quantitative numbers to give in terms of, for example, dollar content -- sorry, semiconductor content per server, dollar value or in terms of the addressable TAM. How do we see this growth of this market? And have we already embedded this into our forecast. Is that correct, Bruce? That's right. Bruce, let me answer this question. We certainly, we have observed an incremental increase in AI-related demand. It will also help the ongoing inventory digestion. The trend is very positive for TSMC. But today, if you ask me to quantitatively to say that how much of the amount increase or what is the dollar content in the server, it's too early to say. It still continue to be developed. And ChatGPT right now reinforce the already stronger conviction that we have in HPC and AI as a structurally megatrend for TSMC's business growth in the future.
Whether this one has been included in our previous announcement is said that we have a 15% to 20% CAGR, the answer is probably partly yes, because of -- for several, we have accelerated into our consideration. But this ChatGPT is a large language model is a new application.
And we haven't really have a kind of a number that put into our CAGR. But is definitely, as I said, it really reinforced our already strong conviction that HPC and AI will give us a much higher opportunities in the future. Okay, Bruce. Does that answer your first question? Yes, sorry, go ahead. Yes. Yes, I want to move on to the different topic, which is the cash dividend. I mean TSMC distributor like -- dividend policy was 70% of the free cash flow. And we do see the free cash flow is getting stronger, especially CapEx growth rate is slower, especially for next year. Can we expect TSMC to maintain the dividend policy, which is 70% of the free cash flow next year? Or we would like to improve our balance sheet given the current rate hike environment. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question is around our cash dividend policy. He notes that in the past, we have said our cash dividend will be based on 70% of free cash flow distribution. But his question is, as our CapEx is slowing, our free cash flow is going stronger. Do we still adhere to 70% of free cash flow or because of the environment, are we more focused on, I think, Bruce, in terms of maintaining a -- improving our balance sheet strength. Okay, Bruce. This is Wendell. Let me make a few comments on the dividends. TSMC is committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing dividends. During the periods of high capital intensity or high capital investment, more of the focus is on sustainable. But when we start to capture and harvest the capital investment spend, the commitment is -- or the focus is more towards steadily increasing.
The 70% ratio is a guidelines. Let me give you an example. If in the particular year, the free cash flow is much lower because of higher CapEx or lower profit than the -- to maintain a sustainable dividend, the ratio of free cash flow to be dispersed could be higher. And on the other hand, in a year where free cash flow is particularly high, the ratio can be 70%, but it can be lower because we need to look forward into the year behind that specific year, and to make sure it is sustainable. Okay, does that answer your question? Yes. Yes. But if we do see a comfortable range about the free cash flow, we still expect like reasonable high payout ratio, right? Yes. Yes. As I said, the principle is 70%, but it has to be sustainable and steadily increasing. I understand. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse. I wanted to ask a question just on the CapEx in 2 parts. First, as you look at the 3-nanometer where you mentioned supply still short of demand and have a lot of applications coming in. Do you have plans for potential reuse of 5-nanometer in the next 1 to 2 years as you bring up more of the 3-nanometer? And then the second part of the question, I wanted to ask more on that Kaohsiung fab shift. If you could go through why the plan to pull back on 28. And then with the intention for where you would shift that investment. Because I know you did cancel the 7-nanometer for that line. So if you could discuss the change you're making to Kaohsiung and does it affect the timing to ramp that fab? Okay. Thank you, Randy. So Randy's first question is kind of related to our CapEx and capacity plan. His question partly is in terms of C.C. noted that the N3 demand exceeds our ability to supply. So he's asking, will we consider to reuse or convert tools -- N5 tools to N3 in the next few years. And also, he wants to know related to our plans in Kaohsiung. What is the thinking or the reasoning for pulling back on the 28-nanometer expansion in Kaohsiung.. Okay, Randy. You got a very good question about whether we converted some of the N5's capacity to N3 because N3 today, we are short of support to our customer. Instead of saying the convert N5 capacity to N3, let me say that we developed a strategy and a methodology to make some of the N3's tool can be supported by N5. And we take this kind of flexibility into our consideration so that we can fulfill our commitment to support our customer in N3 as much as possible. Although still not enough, but we are doing that. So that answer one of your -- the first part of your question.
You asked about Kaohsiung's TAM. Let me say that we look at the market situation today, and we are going to build -- initially the 28 nanometers that demand is so high so that we have to put Kaohsiung into our consideration. However, the market situation is so dynamic, and we look at our plan.
One of the plan is in Japan, we build a new fab for 28 nanometers of specialty. By the way, TSMC expand the mature node's capacity or for specialties. We don't increase capacity just for pure logic application. The other one, no, we don't do. So in order to avoid some of the overcapacity. So we built 1 in Japan. We're also expanding our capacity, 28-nanometer capacity in Nanjing. That's the second one. And then we are considering of the euro. That might be the third one for automotive application.
Put all 3 together, we don't think today that Kaohsiung's -- if we build 28-nanometer probably, it won't be kind of financially feasible. So we diverted now adjusted to become a more advanced node, which we are still in shortage. And Kaohsiung is so close to Tainan so that we can have more flexibility in between. Randy, did that answer your question? Yes. No, that's helpful. It sounds like it will be very much advanced capacity than like the 5, 3 and below. And just -- maybe I have one follow-up on the first question is on the CapEx framework. With the expectation second half kind of rebound with the share gains comes through considering the new nodes more capital-intensive, should we think of this CapEx having an up direction as we look ahead to next year? Okay. So Randy, I'll allow this to be a follow-up, but Randy's question is basically, well, considering the second half business will be stronger. I think, Randy, basically, you're asking, we have provided the guidance range of between $32 billion to $36 billion. Are you asking could that be upside or revised higher, is that correct? Yes, more the framework into next year since this is more kind of prudent management, a bit recessionary. Randy, let me answer that. As we stated before, every year, our CapEx is spent for the opportunities in the future years. So although there are short-term cyclicality in the industry, but we believe if the structural long-term demand is there, and the future opportunities is there, and we will continue to invest. That will be the framework that we can provide to you. Okay, Randy. You have a quick second question. Yes, I'll do the quick second. So for 2-nanometer, if you could clarify the ramp, do you expect this steep ramp to be in 2025? Or is it more 2026? And do you also view that ramp being much more with the SOIC, the back-end integration throughput? Okay. So Randy, second question is on 2-nanometer. We have said volume production in 2025. Will the large volume be in '25 or '26 as part of this question. And does this mean you will go hand-in-hand, I guess, with SoIC and advanced packaging? Randy, let me answer the question. 2-nanometer technology definitely will start to ramp in 2025. And you asked about the volume. The volume in 2023 certainly is much higher than 2025 because 2025 is the year. But saying that, I mean that we are having HPC customer and the smartphone customer now engaged with N2 and what we'll be ramping up in 2025. Now whether it's related to CHIPS Act or not, it depends on customers' product and their plan. And today, I don't have -- I cannot share with you all those kind of minor details because it's related to customer's product plan. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? The next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. C.C., Wendell and Jeff, so first of all, congrats for the first quarter gross margin and great to hear that N3E continue to improve. So let me stay with the CapEx question for a little bit as my first question.
So first of all, the major equipment supplier ASML, to suggest that EUV orders get pushed out a little bit. And we all know that your company is a major user of EUV. So can anyone answer the question? First of all, whether the CapEx this year will be lower end of your guidance range? And also for next year, whether your CapEx intensity would decline year-on-year given that EUV push out? Okay. So Charlie's first question is related to CapEx. He points out that newspaper talks about EUV orders being pushed out. So his question is really for our CapEx in 2023, do we think it will be towards the lower end of the range? And then also any indication for 2024 in terms of both CapEx and capital intensity. Is that correct, Charlie? Yes. Okay. Maybe Wendell can answer. Charlie, this is Wendell. First of all, we don't comment on specific suppliers or customers or competitors. Regarding this year's CapEx when we gave out the CapEx range, $32 billion to $36 billion, we have already started or tightened up our 2023 capital budget.
At this moment, we believe this range is appropriate and it's prudent under today's economic environment, that range is still valid. Now for next year, it's too early to talk about next year. But as I just stated, if the CapEx spend this year will be for future years, and CapEx spend next year will be for even future years. So if we see the growth opportunities is there, then we will continue to invest. That's the main policy, the principle that we have. Yes. Yes, thanks for the clarification. So I guess the question is if, right, whether those growth drivers still there, meaning because it was outsourcing for 2024, and whether your customers are aggressively adopting your N3 and N2. Yes, I guess that's why we are concerned about whether 2024, you're reducing some CapEx. But anyway, let me shift to the next one. I think a lot of investors also quite interested about the U.S. CHIPS Act. So I remember Chairman showed some concern about those requirements. I'm not sure which one is specifically concerned, for example, I need to disclose customer information, profit sharing, some restrictions for the future China fab investments.
So my question is that how TSMC is going to reconcile your own interest versus the U.S. government's requirement. And if it is hard to reconcile, whether TSMC would consider not to take U.S. government's grants. Okay. So Charlie's second question is regarding the CHIPS Act. He notes we have recently said that some of the terms may be not acceptable. So he wants to understand how will TSMC reconcile its own interest versus some of the guidelines or guardrails around the CHIPS Act. And is there a possibility that we will not accept or participate in the CHIPS Act. Okay, Charlie, let me make a few comments on this one. We are currently in the application process and, therefore, we're not able to comment on specific details. However, we are in close and constant communication with the U.S. government so that we fully understand all the details and provide our feedback and comments to them. At the end, all the decisions that we make will be based on the best interest of TSMC. The next one to ask question, Brett Simpson from Arete Research. Yes. Wendell, I wanted to just talk a bit about Arizona. And now that you're scheduled to move into production next year and you've been hiring a lot of people, how do we think about the cost premium for TSMC operating in the U.S.?
And then when it comes to the pricing for the wafers, would this be something that you charge a premium for, for accessing U.S. capacity? Or would you be sort of offering similar wafer pricing to what you offer in Taiwan? Okay. Thank you, Brett. So Brett's first question is around -- regarding our Arizona fab. He notes that the volume manufacturing schedule is on track, and we've hired lots of people. So his first question is to Wendell around sort of what is the cost premium that we face in Arizona and how will we manage this, including our wafer pricing. Will we charge a different price for a different fab? Or how do we intend to do it? Okay, Brett. The overseas fab is indeed the cost is higher, at least in the first several years. And we stated last time that some of the components like the construction costs may be as high as 5x. Now the way to mitigate that, first of all, it's -- it represents our global expansion represent a value to the customers, then we will be selling that value as well.
And secondly, because of our large base and volume, we'll be able to leverage that big base and volume to lower down the cost. And at the same time, of course, we will need to secure the necessary level of government support.
So putting all these efforts together, we will -- our job is to minimize the cost gap and make appropriate return. For the whole company on a combined basis, the 53% and higher gross margin remains our long-term financial goal and is achievable. Great. And maybe just a follow-up. I wanted to ask about the subsidies that TSMC are getting today, particularly in areas like Japan. How much is this going to be in 2023? And are you expecting a meaningful increase in support in the second half of the year? I'm just trying to understand what's embedded in guidance and how to think about accounting for the support that you're expecting over the medium term. Okay. So Brett has a quick follow-up with regards to Japan. His question in terms of the government support or incentives we may receive. How will we account for it? How much will it be in 2023 and how significant? Is it most of it in the second half? Okay. Brett, let me reply this matter. In Japan, we will -- our total CapEx is about $8 billion, and we expect about 50% to receive from the government. And we will be production -- stop production at the end of next year. So the incentives from the government will be according -- will be based on the progress that we are building our fabs. So that gives you some idea of how much we can receive this year and next year.
How do we account for it? Basically, we will be -- that will be accounted for as an offset of depreciation. Okay? Okay. Thank you, Brett. Operator, can we move on to the next participant then? Next, we have Sunny Lin from UBS. So my first question is on the pricing. So I think, just now, management again reiterated that your supply chain value is increasing and you look to sell that value. And so with that, as you are about to start ramping overseas capacity more significantly into next couple of years, how should we think about your ASP trend? Okay. So Sunny's first question is also related to pricing. She knows that semiconductor industry value in the supply chain TSMC is increasing. Her question is that, Sunny, I believe as we expand our footprint and capacity beyond Taiwan and go overseas, what will be the ASP trend in the next few years. Is that correct? That's right. Okay. Sunny, I answer this question. First, actually, our pricing strategy actually is strategic and long term. We work with our customer. Yes, you are right. I mean, that the inflation or all others, the cost is increasing, especially in the overseas fab.
However, we already put all those kind of things into consideration. And we have a lot of action items to work with internally and also with our partners, our supply partners and to lower down all the costs. And we're also working on the supply chain management. So we hope that we will control that, even with today's very tough situation. Got it. Sorry, if I could have a very quick follow-up. And so how should we think about the mechanism? For you to reflect that supply chain value, would it be an annual pricing negotiation? And I also wonder what's the customer feedbacks under the current situations. All right. So Sunny wants to know how will we do the pricing. Is it on an annual basis? How -- what's the feedback from customers? Sunny, this is very specific, but let me emphasize again. Our pricing is strategic, and we reflect our value. Now our value includes the value of a geographic flexibility. Did that give you some hint? Got it. That's very helpful. My second question is on your CapEx expansion. And so I wonder, if we look at the equipment lead time, are you seeing ongoing improvement? What I'm trying to understand, if you need to tighten up the CapEx. But let's say, if later on, demand start to recover or get better into second half of the year, how much flexibility you have to pull in the equipment? Okay. So Sunny's, second question is around capacity expansion and equipment lead time. She notes that we have said we're tightening up our CapEx this year and being prudent given the economic environment.
But her question is if the demand recovers in the second half, how quickly can we adjust our equipment and capacity? And would the equipment lead time then become a bottleneck? Is that correct, Sunny? That's right. Okay. Sunny, this is a very, very good question. We are tightening up on the CapEx. But at the same time, we also remain flexible that once the demand pick up quickly, we should be -- have prepared enough capacity for our customers to grow.
And so both factors are very important, and we are working with all the suppliers preparing for that. In fact, we are planning our long-term capacity expansion and then with some kind of adjustment in between.
So we have a flexibility to increase quickly. We also have a flexibility to tighten the CapEx. But the main trend stays the same because we believe AI, 5G, the megatrend will continue to grow, and TSMC business will continue to grow. All right. Thank you, Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one, we have Laura Chen from Citi. My first question is about the data center and server space. We know that in the high computing PC category that also includes some of the PC CPU or consumer-related applications. So that may show some weakness that we see the quarter-on-quarter decline in Q1.
But I'm just wondering that since we see quite promising AI server growth, what's -- specifically, if we look at the AI-related contribution at current right now or what's the growth outlook you may be looking for? Okay. So Laura's question, she notes that our HPC platform includes more consumer-facing things such as PC CPUs, but it also includes data and server -- data center and server, sorry. So her question is, really, I guess, what is TSMC's view on the growth outlook for AI data centers? And how significant this could be for HPC business. Yes. So if we -- excluding those like gaming GPU or consumer PC CPU in this category, so what's the data center and server business looks right now? Laura, let me answer this question. We did see some positive signs of the people getting much more attention to AI application, especially the ChatGPT's area. However, as I said, quantitatively, we haven't have enough data to summing it up to see what is the contribution and what kind of percentage to TSMC's business. But we remain confident that this trend is definitely positive for TSMC. And we don't break down our HPC platform into those type of subsegments. Okay. Understood. And then my second question is also related to the high computing PC angle. Just wondering that your expansion and trend in advanced packaging, so we know that many of those like AI or server high-computing PC CPU, they require the advanced packaging like a CoWoS or a 2.5D, 3D packaging.
So I'm just wondering that any more capacity you require right now. And what's the current capacity or revenue you can share with us and also the growth trend? Okay. So Laura's second question is on the advanced packaging. She notes that applications like HPC, PC CPUs, et cetera, require CoWoS or 3D stacking, 3D IC advanced packaging technology. So her question is, what is the capacity expansion outlook or plan for our advanced packaging? And also what is the revenue growth outlook, I guess, over the next few years. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. Okay. Laura, let me start. For the advanced packaging, the back-end services, we think that its growth in next about 5 years will be slightly higher than the corporate average. However, for this year, is -- the revenue will be lower than that of last year because of customer demand.
Last year, the revenue accounted for about 7% of our total revenue. This year is somewhere between 6 to 7. So that should give you an idea of the overall packaging. Okay. So in terms of the capacity, is there any change in this year versus last year? So her question -- also a part of the question is specific to the capacity for packaging. What is the year-on-year growth in the advanced packaging capacity? Well, Laura -- no, no, no. I mean, that's -- semi says that, actually, just recently in these 2 days, I received a customer's phone call requesting a big increase on the back-end capacity, especially in the CoWoS. We are still evaluating that. Okay. Thank you . Operator, please move on to the next participant, please. Yes. Next one to ask questions, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Yes. Your guide for June and also 2023 revenue suggests revenues in the second half of the year would be up by 25% versus the first half. And what I want to better understand is how will new product ramps drive this growth.
Is there anything quantitative or qualitative that you can offer us to understand the mechanics or the drivers behind this 25% growth in revenue from first half into the second half? And I have a follow-up. Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. So Mehdi's first question is in looking at our guidance, his calculation implies around mid-20s half-on-half growth in the second half. So he wants to know how much is new projects or new business driving that percentage of the growth. Well, I can answer that question. To give you a hint, I mean, that we talk about customer's new product launch and which use a 3-nanometer. So you can understand that we start to ramp up 3-nanometer quickly because it fully utilize and still not enough to meet customers' demand. In addition to that, actually, all the platforms, their performance, their demand will increase in the second half. So as these new products drive wafer shipment increase, we should assume that utilization rates would bottom in June and improve into the second half, right? So Mehdi wants -- so can -- he wants to know, can you assume utilization bottoms in 2Q and improves in second half. Yes, Mehdi, that's a reasonable view. C.C. has already said second half will be stronger than first half. Do you have a second question, Mehdi? Yes. I have one for Wendell. This question comes from every earnings conference call, capital intensity. Should we assume that as you tighten your CapEx project for this year? And especially in the context of declining revenues for the whole year, are we at the tail end of elevated capital intensity?
Or should we assume that you -- over the past couple of years, there has been significant investment and starting next year, you're going to be able to scale your revenues? Is that the right way of thinking about all these investments that you have done? Okay. So Mehdi's second question is on -- around capital intensity. He wants to know, given the guidance we have provided for 2023, are we at the tail end of the higher capital intensity period or elevated capital intensity period? And then will we start to, I guess, harvest or see that capital intensity come down next year or into the next few years? Mehdi, I am not going to share with you the peak, where the peak is. But I can tell you from my current 5-year outlook, we are looking at about mid-30s percentage of capital intensity. Thank you, Mehdi. Operator, let's move on to the next participant. Yes. The next one to ask questions, Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. My first one is on your comment that the N3 capacity will be fully utilized this year, is that capacity that will be online in the second half same or higher or lower than what you planned a year ago? And also at this point, do you see the N3 wafer demand profile to be similar or better than N5 at the same point in the cycle? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. So Krish's first question is on N3 capacity. Note we said they will be fully utilized this year. He wants to know the capacity that we build or plan for N3 this year and in the second half. How does that capacity amount compared to what we expected a year ago? Well, I can answer the question. Actually, the demand is higher than we thought a year ago, and that's why that we need to work very hard to meet customer's demand. Did that answer your question, Krish? Got it, got it. And then just a quick follow-up. You spoke about AI being a positive and all the innovation happening in generative AI today. Just from a TSMC standpoint, is this fair to assume that what you're going through today is more on the training stage and therefore is more semiconductor and wafer intensive, but when you go into more inference, that intensity has to decrease? Is that a fair assumption? Or do you think that this level of intensity will continue growing from a TSMC standpoint for AI? Okay. So Krish's, second question is regards to generative AI and these type of applications. His observation is that the majority is training today, which seems to be beneficial. But as training moves to inference, would it be less semi-intensive or semi content intensive? And then, therefore, would that be, i.e., lower benefit to TSMC? Krish, I mean, that today, your observation is right because, right now, most of the AI concentrate or focus on training. And in the future, it will be inference. But let me say that, no matter what kind of application, they need to use a very high-performance semiconductor component, and that actually is a TSMC's advantage.
So we expect that semiconductor content starting from a data center for [indiscernible] to device and edge device or those kind of things, put all together, they need a very high-speed computing with a very power-efficient one. And so we expect it will add to TSMC's business a lot. Qualitatively, as I said, we didn't know yet. We hope that in the next few quarters, we can give a more clear picture. Okay. Thank you. Operator, in the interest of time, we will take the last 2 questions from the last 2 participants, please. So can we proceed to the next participant? Next one is Brad Lin from Bank of America. I have two questions, one on the internal organization change and the other on the recently announced strategic alliance. So while the global expansion is a key focus of TSMC, I noticed that TSMC set up a new unit called overseas operations office, OOO. What are the targets and impact that the TSMC management will look for from this new unit? That's my first question. Okay. So Brad's first question is about our internal organization change. We set up an overseas office we call OOO. So he wants to know what is the purpose of this organization or office. What is its targets and purpose? Well, the purpose is very simple, because we need to have all the organization. Now the fab is overseas fab's number and the amount would be more and more. So we need to have a coherence or -- and the culture, everything aligned to the headquarter to TSMC's core value.
So we established this overseas operation office to make sure that headquarter's support to each overseas fab, what is sufficient and enough. And so that the performance will be aligned or matched with the TSMC's fab in Taiwan. But more importantly, because of we have this organization, so we can help them to be succeed and, in the future, can be more profitable. Thank you, C.C. Brad, do you want to -- yes, your second question. Sure. So my second question will be on the recently announced strategic alliance. As there no migration is the foundry's competition focus, and we know that TSMC leadership in the leading edge. We recently see TSMC hang up with NVIDIA, Synopsys and ASML on 2-nanometer production and beyond.
And what is the target? And how is the progress so far? And TSMC is currently the only foundry within that group. Should we expect an even larger gap to peers with this? Or should we allow more companies or competitors to join this group? Brad, sorry. Let me clarify, make sure we understand your second question. So your second question is talking about, you call it, an alliance. But I think you referred to ASML and NVIDIA. So are you referring to this announcement recently of the -- what is called the cuLitho? Exactly, yes, computational litho. Yes. Okay. So -- okay. Got it. So Brad really wants to know what is management's view towards this recently announced cuLitho. What is the implication? And what does this mean for TSMC's competitiveness, sorry, going forward? Okay. That's a good question. It is initiative invented by TSMC's customer NVIDIA. And actually, we are working with them. And this, particularly the software and the hardware, together will help speed up computational lithography by moving expensive operation to GPU, which will help us deploy lithography solution like inverse lithography technology, deeper learning more broadly or et cetera.
And because of this one, we got involved with our customer and our supplier. And we expect that this will give us some advantage over our cost improvement and also competition. Sure. Thank you, Brad. Operator, then can we move on to the last participant, please? The last questions are from Charles Shi from Needham & Company. I have a question about your CapEx. Maybe I want to start with one item you disclosed in your filings. On your balance sheet, you have an item called equipment under installation and construction in progress.
That number has hit a record high, I think, over USD 40 billion as of the end of fourth quarter '22, which kind of means there are $40 billion investment. You put money in, but you are not harvesting that investment yet. But there's no revenue dollars being generated.
But now I think you said you're tightening the CapEx for 2023, but you're reiterating that $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx. That seems to be adding on top of that $40 billion. A lot more investment is still expected in this year.
So my question really is about this. Are you expecting a significantly higher incremental revenue opportunity in 2024 and beyond to justify that $40 billion plus, maybe another $32 billion investment? Or is the cycle time between you put the money in, put the investment into the time you harvest the investment, the generated revenue is getting a little bit longer than usual? So hopefully, you can clarify this. Okay, Charles. That is a very long question. Please let me try to summarize it a little bit into 2 parts. I think Charles' question, he does rightly note that on our balance sheet, equipment under installation reached roughly about $40 billion at the end of 2022.
He notes this is a very high level. His concern, maybe Wendell can address, as we also guided for $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx this year, so is this number going to only increase? And what is driving this? Is this preparing for significant revenue opportunities in 2024 and beyond? So this is his first question. Okay, Charles. The $40 billion asset under construction at the end of last year primarily come from 2 nodes, an N3 node and the N5 node. N3 node, that is because we're ramping up the N3 nodes. And N5, we continue to increase our capacity.
Therefore, these 2 add together, you see a big -- a bigger asset under construction at the end of last year. From what I can see going forward, this number will be -- will gradually come down in the next few years. Okay, Charles. Yes. Maybe the other part of this question is because you are proceeding with that $32 billion to $36 billion, that -- it's hard for me to reconcile how this number comes down, at least in the next one year or so over the next 12-month horizon.
How do I reconcile that? Or are you expecting, like, next year, there's going to be a significant revenue -- incremental revenue come in to TSMC? Charles, as we said, it's too early to talk about next year. But we also said that if we continue to see the future growth opportunities there, we will continue to invest. May I ask the second question? Sure. Yes. So the second question is about CHIPS Act. I heard you provided some help to the question from another analyst. But can you kind of quantify the potential benefits from the U.S. CHIPS Act, the manufacturing incentives, which to my understanding, including both grants and investment tax credit? I know this is kind of relevant to our modeling going forward.
And maybe if I may, can I ask -- one of your U.S. peers seems to be favoring investment tax credit over grants. They seem to only want the investment tax credit, not the grants. What is TSMC's thinking between these 2 different funding opportunities? Okay. Thank you, Charles. So Charles' second question is around the CHIPS Act. He is asking if you can quantify the potential benefits, both in terms of grants and also in terms of tax credits. And also, do we favor one over the other or preference for one over the other? Charles, as I said, we are in the process of the application, so we're not in a position to disclose any details. I will refrain from sharing more information at this moment. Okay. Thank you, Wendell. All right. So thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session.
Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 30 minutes from now, and the transcript will become available 24 hours from now. Both of these will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you all continue to stay well, and we look forward to joining us again next quarter.

TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode.
The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2023, followed by our guidance for the third quarter 2023. Afterwards, Mr. Huang, TSMC's CEO, Dr. C. C. Wei; and TSMC's Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for a question-and-answer session.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter of 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter.
Second quarter revenue decreased 5.5% sequentially in NT or 6.2% in U.S. dollars as our second quarter business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand and led to customers' ongoing inventory adjustment.
Gross margin decreased 2.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.1%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and higher electricity cost, partially offset by more stringent cost control and a more favorable foreign exchange rate.
Despite the industry's cyclical downturn, we continue to invest in R&D to support our N3 and N2 development. Thus, operating margin was 42%, down 3.5 percentage points sequentially. Overall, our first quarter EPS was NT7.01 and ROE was 23.2%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 30% of our wafer revenue, excuse m e, in the second quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 23%. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 53% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC decreased 5% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our second quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 9% to account for 33%. IoT decreased 11% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 3% to account for 8%, and DCE increased 25% to account for 3%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT1.5 trillion or USD 48 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by NT62 billion, mainly due to the net decrease of NT87 billion in income tax payable as we pay NT120 billion for 2022 income tax, offset by NT33 billion accrued tax payables for the second quarter.
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by NT53 billion mainly as we raised NT41 billion in corporate bonds. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 32 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 99 days, primarily due to entry ramp during the quarter.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about NT167 billion in cash from operations, spent NT251 billion in CapEx, distributed NT71 billion for third quarter 2022 cash dividend and raised NT41 billion from corporate bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance decreased by NT109 billion to NT1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter.
Free cash flow was negative NT83 billion during the quarter as operating cash flow was more than offset by capital expenditures, partly due to the income tax payment of NT120 billion. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled NT8.17 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between NT16.7 billion and USD 17.5 billion, which represents a 9.1% sequential increase at the midpoint.
Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to NT30.8, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin to be between 38% and 40%. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our second quarter '23 and third quarter '23 profitability. Compared to first quarter, our second quarter gross margin decreased by 220 basis points sequentially to 54.1%, primarily due to a lower capacity utilization.
Compared to our second quarter guidance, our actual gross margin slightly exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago, mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate.
We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline by 1.6 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily as the higher level of capacity utilization rate is offset by 2 to 3 percentage points margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the continued steep ramp-up of our 3-nanometer to dilute our fourth quarter gross margin by about 3 to 4 percentage points.
In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion and inflationary costs, including higher utility costs in Taiwan. To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. While we face near-term challenges, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our 2023 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 capital budget to be towards the lower end of our range of between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion.
Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by mid-20s percent year-over-year in 2023, mainly as we ramp our 3-nanometer technologies. Despite near-term inventory cycle, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile.
We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.
Now let me make a few comments on our cash dividend distribution policy. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the capital - the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders.
As a result of our rigorous capital management, in May, TSMC Board of Directors approved the distribution of NT3 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2023, and up from NT2.75 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward.
First quarter '23 cash dividend will be distributed in October 2023. For 2023, TSMC shareholders will receive a total of NT11.25 per share dividend and at least NT12 per share cash dividend for 2024. Going forward, as our capital intensity begins to decline in the next several years, the focus of our cash dividend policy is expected to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share in the next few years.
Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of USD 15.7 billion [ph] in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the second quarter was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end market demand and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment.
Moving into third quarter 2023. While we have recently observed an increase in AI-related demand, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the third quarter to be supported by the strong ramp of our 3-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers continued inventory adjustment.
In the last quarterly conference, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to rebalance to a healthier level exiting the third quarter. This statement continue to hold true. However, due to persistent weaker overall mega economic conditions slower-than-expected demand recovery in China and overall softer end market demand conditions, customers are more cautious and intend to further control their inventory into 4Q '23.
Thus while we maintain our forecast for the 2023 semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single digit year-over-year, we now expect the foundry industry to decline mid-teens and our full year 2023 revenue to decline around 10% in U.S. dollar term. With such inventory control, we also forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to exit 4Q '23 at a healthier and lower level as compared to our expectation 3 months ago.
Next, let me talk about the HPC and TSMC's long-term growth outlook. As we have said before, the massive structural increase in demand for computation underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC continues to drive greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require use of leading-edge technologies. These megatrends are expected to fill TSMC's long-term growth. Even with a more challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15 and 20 CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is a target we communicated back in January 2022 Investor Conference.
The recent increase in AI-related demand is directionally positive for TSMC. Generative AI requires higher computing power and interconnect bandwidth, which drive increasing semiconductor content. With using CPUs, GPUs or AI accelerator and related ASIC for AI and machine learning, the commonality is that it requires use of leading-edge technology and a strong foundry design ecosystem. These are all TSMC's strengths.
Today, server AI processor demand, which we define as CPUs, GPUs and AI accelerators that are performing training and influence [ph] functions accounts for approximately 6% of TSMC's total revenue. We forecasted this to grow at close to 50% CAGR in the next 5 years and increase to low teens percent of our revenue.
The sensible [ph] need for energy-efficient computation is starting from data centers, and we expect [indiscernible] proliferate to edge and devices of time, which will further long term, which will drive further long-term opportunities. We have already embedded a certain assumption for AI demand into our long-term CapEx and growth forecast.
Our HPC platform is expected to be the main engine and the largest incremental contributor to TSMC's long-term growth in the next several years. While the quantification of the total addressable opportunity is still ongoing, generative AI and large language model only reinforce the already strong conviction we have in the structural mega trend to drive TSMC's long-term growth, and we will closely monitor the development for further potential upside.
Now let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. N3 is already involved in production with good yield. We are seeing robust demand for N3 and we expect a strong ramp of N3 in the second half of this year, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications.
N3 is expected to continue to contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3E further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and provide complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed the qualification and achieved performance and yield target and will start volume production in the fourth quarter of this year.
With our continuous enhancement of 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-yield demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I'll talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 top [ph] nanosheet transistor structure to provide our customer with the best performance, cost and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency and our N2 watt delivered full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing.
As part of N2-technology platform, we also developed N2 with backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. Backside power rail will provide 10% to 12% additional speed gain and 10% to 15% large density boost on top of the baseline technology. We are targeting backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026.
We are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement at N2 from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced and to further extend our technology leadership right into the future.
This concludes my prepared remarks, and now let me turn the microphone over to Mark. Thank you, C. C. And good afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to talk about TSMC's global manufacturing footprint, status update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. Our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust and to expand our future growth potential and to reach for more global talents.
Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government support. That is to maximize the value of our shareholders and to fulfill our fiduciary duty. In Arizona, we are building our first fab to provide U.S. most advanced semiconductor technology in mass production to support the needs for U.S. semiconductor infrastructure. Our fab in Arizona started construction in April, 2021 with an aggressive schedule. We are now entering a critical phase of handling and installing the most advanced and dedicated equipment.
However, we are encountering certain challenges, as there is an insufficient amount of skill workers with those specialized expertise required for equipment installation in a semiconductor grade facility. While we are working on to improve the situation, including sending experienced technicians from Taiwan to train the local skill workers for a short period of time. We expect the production schedule of N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025.
In Japan, we are building a specialty technology factory, which will utilize 12, 16 and 22, 28 process technologies. Volume production is on track for late 2024. In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate building a specialty fab in Germany, focusing on automotive specific technologies based on the demand from our customers and the level of government support.
In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as we planned to support our customer in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulations fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and to expand our capacity to support our customers' growth.
From a cost perspective, the initial cost of overseas fab are higher than TSMC's fabs in Taiwan due to: one, the smaller fab scale; two, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and three, the early stage of semiconductor ecosystem on those overseas sites, as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan.
In our recent meetings with senior government officials in the U.S., Japan and Europe, we discussed our plans to expand our global manufacturing footprint to them. We also emphasize one of our major responsibility is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize return for our shareholders. Those discussions went very well. All sites understand the critical and integral role TSMC plays in the semiconductor industry, and we appreciate all the government's ongoing support in working with TSMC to help narrow down the cost gap. We will continue to work closely with all the governments to secure the further support.
Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which includes the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we will leverage our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume and economies of scale to continuously drive our cost down.
By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fab, while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer no matter where we operate. Thus, even as we expand our capacity overseas, TSMC's long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25% is achievable, and we will continue to maximize the value for our shareholders.
This concludes our key messages. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Chairman. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions]
Now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? The first one – question, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. And thanks for a lot of clarity on the AI-related exposure. My first question is on the AI front. A lot of TSMC's customers have been talking about capacity shortage and having to kind of queue up for capacity for AI accelerators, including GPUs and ASICs. Could TSMC talk a little bit about what TSMC is doing on the capacity side, especially on the advanced packaging, but also on other areas?
And when do you expect to get back to some degree of demand and supply balance for these AI accelerators? Is it going to be only sometime next year? Or you think it could happen quicker based on what you see on demand from your customers and the capacity plan? Okay. Gokul, thank you. Let me try to - please allow me to summarize your first question. So first question from Gokul is that he notes that we are - customers are seeing strong demand from AI-related, but they're facing capacity tightness or shortage. So his question is, what are we doing in terms of the capacity side, maybe both in terms of the advanced packaging, as well as the logic? And then when do we see the demand-supply imbalance returning to a better, healthier balance level? Is it sometime next year? Is that correct, roughly, Gokul? Yes. Right. Okay. Gokul, this is C. C. Wei. Let me answer your question. For the AI, right now, we see a very strong demand, yes. For the Tongan [ph] part, we don't have any problem to support. But for the back end, the advanced packaging side, especially for the cohorts, we do have some very tight capacity to - very hard to fulfill 100% of what customer needed. So we are working with customers for the short term to help them to fulfill the demand, but we are increasing our capacity as quickly as possible. And we expect these tightening will be released in next year, probably towards the end of next year. But in between, we're still working closely with our customers to support their growth. Okay. And C. C., maybe one follow up. Could you let us show what kind of capacity expansion, like how much capacity you're expanding on the cohort side? Like any kind of quantity, what kind of capacity you are adding? Okay. So Gokul, just an additional to the first question, how much capacity are we going to increase in terms of cohorts [ph] Let me give you - I will not give you the exact number, but let me give you a roughly probably 2x of the capacity will be added. Okay, Gokul. Gokul? Okay, Gokul, are you there? If not, operator, maybe we move on to the next participant. Gokul, are you there? Okay. I think there was - disconnected. All right. Let's move on to the next caller, person, please. Next one to ask question, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Okay. Thank you for taking my question. I still want to know about like, the TSMC maintained the 15% to 20% up in CAGR, when we cut this year's revenue to minus 10%, right. That's all – will you use that 15% revenue CAGR to 2026, that seem slight above like 25-plus percent present data [ph] from the coming 2 years, which means that the overall semi growth is not increased like a lot for the next 2 years. And you just mentioned that the AI only accounts for 6% with low teens potentially. That is not big enough to get back to the trend. So what is the underlying growth you have with the global training in the coming years? And what are the key assumptions for the growth for each segment? Okay. Bruce, let me try to summarize your first question. So Bruce's first question is on our long-term growth CAGR, which we have said is to be between 15% to 20% from '21 to '26 CAGR period. So Bruce's question, this year, C.C., just said we will decline around 10%. Under his calculation, I think he's saying, well, this implies you should grow 25% the next several years, which, of course, this is a CAGR, but nonetheless. And so Bruce's question is that, therefore, if that's the type of growth, then shouldn't that imply a much higher growth level for the overall semiconductor excluding memory industry. I think that is your question, Bruce. Am I correct? Yes. What are the key assumptions for this quarter? Okay. Let me handle this question. The - your rationale is correct. However, some of the factors may not be totally included. For one thing, in your model that the customer's gross margin, 60% plus, I don't think that will represent the average customer's gross margin and maybe some specific ones.
However, the other one is the market share. The market share factor, you assumed the constant, that is not - one thing that could be different than in your formula. So the semiconductor growth, right now, we are forecasting 4% to 5%. It may increase, but definitely, as you said, it won't increase to 10%. But those longer-term semiconductor, excluding memory growth is still yet to be evaluated. Did I answer your question? Yes. But the reason - the reason I do that is I'm assuming that you have like 1 million [ph] market share in the advanced node and also the growth is mostly coming from an advanced node, which customers growth lines is supposed to be higher. So I think that the gap is wide enough. That's what I'm wondering right, whether I miss anything, which might be big enough to move the needle that might - investments that the management might - can give us some color? I don't - this is a factor. As far as the market share value, you might not totally included all the factors. That's my perspective. But I cannot dig into the numerical comparison at this point here. What I mean, the market share is not just the advanced leading-edge technologies, but also the share of the outsourcing. So maybe, Bruce, if I summarize again, TSMC's growth is driven by both the underlying structural megatrends but also by our technology leadership and differentiation. So our CAGR is a combination of those two factors. Okay. Thank you. Do you have any... Yes. My next question is regarding to the guidance changes. The previous guidance for the full year was long to mid-single digit, now is about like 10% decline. So the gap is like 5% of the total revenue, which is like quite sizable in terms of revenue. With that $3 billion, $4 billion highly concentrated in the second half of fourth quarter. Can you give us like what are the changes in terms of this shortfall? Where are the weakness come from? Okay. So Bruce's, second question is looking at our 2023 full year guidance. He noticed last time, we had said low to mid-single-digit decline. This time, we have guided to around 10%. So his question is the delta of this seems to be all - a lot of it also in the fourth quarter. So what - is there any particular segment or market that is driving this? And what are the factors behind this? Is that correct, Bruce? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Bruce, let me answer the question. Yes, we did see something different. The first, the maker is weaker than what we thought. Three months ago, we probably - probably more optimistic, but now it's not. Also that is - for example, China economy’s recovery is actually also weaker than what we thought. And so the end market demand actually did not grow as we expected.
So put all together, even we have a very good AIs processor demand is still not enough to offset all those kinds of macro impact. So now we expect that the whole year will become minus 10%. That's what we thought. And in terms of by particular segment or is there a particular market? It's almost - well, thank you. You are asking me the question. It's almost intact... I understand my question. Thank you. Yes. It's overall market segment is being impacted because of - it's a combination of the macroeconomics. So can we conclude that other than AI, almost every application see some weakness in the second half? You got it. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one to ask question is Gokul Hariharan from JP Morgan. Gokul, you are back. Okay. Yes, sorry about that. So next question, just wanted to ask about TSMC management's view on the current inventory cycle. It looks like this cycle is a much - taking it much longer to get through the down cycle compared to '19 and 2015. When do you think we kind of bottom out? And do you feel that the recovery in next year is going to be a strong recovery? Or you think it's going to be a more gradual recovery? What are the kind of plans that we are putting in place as we think about next year's recovery once inventory situation last cycle [ph] Thank you. Okay. So Gokul's second question is about the inventory correction cycle. He notes this cycle seems to be taking much longer to get through as compared to 2019 and/or 2015. So his second question is when do we think this cycle can bottom out? What will 2024 next year look like? Do we expect a strong recovery? And what factors are we looking at? Is that correct, Gokul? Yes. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Okay. Gokul, this is a good question. Let me answer it in a short one sentences, all about the bank core [ph] I mean I just say the macroeconomic is not so - it's become weaker than we thought. In fact, higher inflation and interest rate impact end demand in all market segments, in every region in the world.
As we said, under such situation, our customers are more cautious in their inventory control in the second half of this year. So while we expect the fabless semiconductor industry, their inventory to be cleaner and healthier existing this year, but we're much closer to the seasonal level, but our expectation for them, they will continue to manage their inventory. And 2024, it is still dependent on the macro situation. Gokul? Okay. So, excuse me, so that - it sounds like you're still expecting at least early part of next year to still be a little bit challenging, similar to what it is looking like right now. Is that fair to say? Look, if you are... About next year... Gokul, we will give you our comment next time for 2024. Thank you. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please? Next one, we have Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. Hey, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is about the overseas fab cost seems to get higher. So would the TSMC consider to further adjust your pricing to absorb those increased costs? And also management mentioned that you're doubling or more than doubling your advanced packaging, given the AI Russia [ph] order. Would that give you a chance to reprice the back end foundry service? Because I remember there was a kind of below company's gross margin average. Would that be a chance to bring that back to the corporate average? Thank you. Okay. Charlie. Charlie's first question is, I guess, regarding pricing, two parts or two angles. First on the overseas fab, given that the costs are higher, would TSMC consider to further adjust our wafer price. And also along similar lines related to advanced packaging, given we are – C.C. said doubling roughly the capacity would we consider to also charge more or higher given that the returns of the back end are lower? Right. Let me answer the first question first. Yes, the overseas fab will cost higher, at least for the near future, where their supply ecosystem is not mature yet. And the labor cost is from our experience, actually it's a little bit higher than we expected.
But to answer your question, yes, as we try to get the maximum government subsidy, and we also really look at the - how the price value for the overseas geographical flexibilities, these are all considered. The aim is to, one, to increase our customer trust, make them continue to work with us going forward under the geopolitical concerns. Secondly is to maximize shareholders' value. To answer your question on price is strategically yes. All right... C.C, can you answer second question? Okay. I think the second question is about the pricing or the - on the cohorts. As I answer the question, we are increasing the capacity as soon as possible manner, of course, not including actual cost. So in fact, we are working with our customers. And the most important thing for them right now is supply assurance, is supply to meet their demand. So we are working with them. We do everything possible to increase the capacity. And of course, at the same time, we share our value. And then... Thanks. So may I - may ask a second question, its a different topic. Is that, okay? Sure. You get two questions. So, sure. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. So another question is about the AI SME demand, right, since you're providing your revenue contribution, growth assumption that is super helpful. But I'm wondering how TSMC can judge the AI demand? Because right now, it's [indiscernible] right now, customers are very aggressive booking capacity. So I'm wondering how company can judge whether those AI SME demand is for real?
And also in terms of breakdown, I'm wondering whether companies said ASIC, the customer ship is outgrowing GPU. I think the more important one should be the first part of the question, especially investors are concerned whether AI is cannibalizing the CPU server demand. So - so those are kind of the questions are in our mind. Thank you. Okay. Let me summarize your second question, Charlie. Charges on AI demand. He wants to know how do we judge the demand properly because customers are very aggressive, but how in his words, how do we know that this demand is real. And then also, how do we see the demand specifically for ASIC as it relates to AI? Okay. You want to answer? Let me try first and you probably... Sure... This is a very deep question. Of course, we have a model, basically. The short-term fancy about the AI demand definitely cannot extrapolate for the long term. Neither can we predict the near future, meaning next year, how the sudden demand will continue or will flatten out. However, our model is based on the data center structure. We assume a certain percentage of the data center processor are AI processors. And based on that, we calculate the AIs processor demand.
And this model is yet to be fitted to the practical data later on. But in general, I think the - our trend of a big portion of data center processor will be AI processor is a sure thing. And we can cannibalize the data center processors. In the short term, when the CapEx of the cloud service provider are fixed, yes, it will. It is. But as for the long term, when their data service, when the cloud services having the generative AI service revenue, I think they will increase the CapEx, that should be consistent with the long-term AI processor demand. And I mean, the CapEx will increase because of a generative AI services. Anything more for you? Yes, Charlie, I think part of Charlie's question is also how do we see ASIC related in AI development? Well, actually, the customer also have a high demand on the ASIC part for the AI application. And as Mark pointed out, a short-term sudden increase, you can extrapolate to be long term. But again, let me emphasize that. Those kind of application in the AI, be it CPUs, GPUs or AI accelerator or ASIC, they all need leading-edge technologies. And they all have one symptom. They are using the very large die size, which is TSMCs strength. Got it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Operator, we'll move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions. Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse. Okay, yes. Thank you. I wanted to shift to the profitability, maybe more for Wendell. For - looking at the fourth quarter, you mentioned the 3 to 4 point dilution from N3. I think that is 2 to 3 points in the third quarter. Is that what you're suggesting, the directional change could be a little bit down margin profile? Or do you have positive offsets that could keep it more stable?
And then a follow-up on the margin, where you discussed is a tough year for margins on these factors, like the energy ramp up 3. But could you discuss 2024, do you think we're going into a period of a bit more challenging profitability or you see factors that we could comfortably get back to the 53 and above next year? Okay. Thank you, Randy. So Randy's first question is on gross margin. Fourth quarter with the N3 dilution of 3% to 4%, does that mean directionally, fourth quarter margin is sequentially down? Are there any positive offsets?
And then for looking to 2024 for the full year, if Wendell can give some comments about 2024 gross margin, will it also be challenging? Or do we still feel confident in a 53% and higher gross margin? Okay, Randy. Starting from the second half of this year, as we said, we faced certain cost challenges, including the ramp up N3 which will dilute about 2 to 3 percentage points in third quarter and 3 to 4 in the fourth quarter, plus the higher electricity cost. But we're not giving our guidance on the fourth quarter at this moment. We're just spelling out some of the challenges that we're seeing. And of course, we are going to continue to drive down our costs and sell our value to ensure that we will have a good return on the node. That's for this year.
For next year, we're seeing - we're not talking about the whole gross margin, but we still see that N3 will dilute about 3 to 4 percentage points of next year's gross margin. And although the yield will be better next year, at the same time, the percentage of revenue contributed by N3 will be bigger. So net-net, worth, we also see some dilution from the N3 next year. But the margin - the guidance will be given out next year. Okay. A quick follow-up to the first question. I think the last few nodes was 2 to 3 points dilution in the first year or 2 of ramp. The factor for it larger, is it the higher capital intensity or something different versus 3 - versus 5 and 7 or it looks like a little bit more dilution? Yes. The increasing process complexity does add on to the challenges of a newer node. However, the other important factor is that our corporate averages has become higher than before. We used to have 50% gross margin. We're now talking about 53% and higher gross margin, okay? Yes. Okay. And the second question, I wanted to ask how you're thinking about CapEx, just netting a few things, the geographic expansion, the 3 and then the start of 2-nanometer, the first ramp up or tool move in versus the mixed outlook you're looking at for macro for a ballpark CapEx into next year?
And if I could maybe within it, ask if the Arizona fab delays, does that push out where you mentioned the low end of guidance, push out some of this year to get some lift to next year? Okay. So Randy's second question is on CapEx. He wants to know basically focusing on 2024 CapEx to some of the delays in the Arizona fab push out CapEx from this year to next year, as we expand overseas, as we invest in N2, but at the same time as the macro remains uncertain, how does this impact 2024 CapEx? Yes. Randy, the push out of fabs does push out some part of the CapEx, but that doesn't affect a big part. For 2024, it's too early to talk about the overall CapEx. However, our CapEx, if you - as we said before, every year, we spend the CapEx to capture the future growth opportunities. And in the past few years, our CapEx has risen very fast to capture the megatrend.
And going forward, the next few years, when we started to harvest those investment, we believe that CapEx will begin to level off in terms of dollar amount and that will lead to - start to lower the capital intensity in the next several years. Sorry, Randy. Sorry, do... Yes, my quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that as you could use your 5-nanometer to support the ramp up 3. Given the AI and some of that pickup, do you still see that potential that could help optimize CapEx? Or do you need to keep it for existing node? And that's my final one. Thank you. Yes. So Randy is just also asking then how does tool commonality play a role in our future CapEx? Yes. We always build two commonality between nodes to provide greater flexibility. We mentioned last time the strong multiyear demand from N3, we are able to support that using some of the tools from N5. We're not going to comment on the CapEx beyond this year. However, as I just mentioned, every year, the CapEx spend to capture the future growth opportunities. Thank you, Wendell. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next participant. Next one to ask questions, Laura Chen from Citi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Very appreciate C.C. and Mark sharing on TSMC's view on the longer-term outlook in AI. So I'm just wondering how does TSMC evaluate your second capacity expansion to think with foundry and wafer side. Since there is no problem in the foundry space, were you kind of concerned about potential overcapacity in the back-end side beyond next year? Or actually, we may see more upside at the foundry wafer side. So our - say, like advanced node utilization rate may go higher into next year? Thank you. That's my first question. Okay. So Laura's first question is looking at our expansion of advanced packaging or back end versus the front end wafer as we are expanding the back end, but not the front end, does that imply that first, that our front-end wafer particularly leading node, we expect the utilization to increase next year? And then conversely, or is there a risk that we are over expanding or overcapacity risk for the packaging side? Okay, Laura. Let me answer the question. AI today is a very hot topic. A lot of my customers right now increase their demand, and that will increase their front end demand, of course. TSMC almost have the major share or the largest share, let me say that in the front end wafer. According to the front ends adopting [ph] we really work closely with our customer and to decide what is the back end that they need.
And so on that perspective, we are planning our cohorts capacity, although probably still not enough, but we're working very hard to increase it. Overcapacity, not today is a concern, that it is concerns, its not enough capacity to support all the very strong demand. Okay. Thank you, C.C. Yes. Thank you. That's very clear. Thank you very much C.C. And my second question is also about the gross margin outlook. If I am wrong, please correct me. I recall that the previous cycle, like 7 or 5-nanometer, the capacity usually will be three times in the third year of the new technology ramping. So I'm still - I'm wondering is still the case for N3. And particularly, we have seen that significant capacity intensity increase may lead some margin pressure, particularly in the first few years. So I'm just wondering how does TSMC balance your technology leadership and also the margin situation? Thank you. Laura, you said three times - sorry, are you referring to the revenue contribution? Sorry, you said N7... The capacity, yes. Okay. So all right, let me try to summarize your question. I think Laura is asking N7, N5, we substantially expand the capacity. And so what is the case for N3 and then also in terms of the profitability of N3 or gross margin, to be more specific as it compares to N5 and N7 previously. Is that roughly correct, Laura? Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Okay, Laura. Let me answer this question. As I just mentioned, the N3, due to the increasing process complexity is becoming more challenging than the previous nodes. We - but at the same time, we will continue to sell our value and drive down the cost at the same time. But the - we still believe that N3 will be a long-lasting and long lasting or a large node for TSMC. With all the efforts and we still believe that the whole company's gross margin will be 53% and higher. Okay. Laura, does that answer your question... Thank you. Really, appreciate. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Laura. Operator, let's move on to the next participant, please. Yes. Right now, we have Rolf Bulk from New Street Research. Go ahead please. Thank you for taking my question. This quarter, you're also using the legacy node 16 and 28-nanometer in particular, were down around 15% to 20% Q-on-Q. And my question is, were there any particular end markets that caused this decline? And how do you think about the recovery of those legacy nodes? Should we still expect recovery in the fourth quarter of this year? Or is that more 2024 event? Thank you. Okay. So Rolf's first question is looking on the mature nodes, such as 16 and 20, 18 nodes – he notes, sorry, that those all saw sequential declines in the second quarter. So his question is, what is driving this - what end markets are driving this decline? And what is the expectation for this in the second half? Well, let me answer that question. The mature nodes wafer actually or the product actually try to be convenient for the smartphone or for the PC market or for the HPC. So while the total unit of smartphone become weaker and PC become weaker. So it's a high - the leading-edge technology node being also demand dropping and so the mature node. That's together. Did I answer your question? Yes. Thank you. That's very clear. My second question, maybe you focus on cohorts and advanced packaging in general and also the weakness that you see in the remainder of your business. Could you maybe comment on the percentage of your CapEx spending that will go towards leading nodes, specialty nodes and packaging this year compared to last year? Okay. So Rolf second question is for 2023 CapEx, which our CFO has said towards the lower end of the 32 to 36%range, can we give a breakdown between leading-edge, specialty technologies and then the packaging testing, mass-making and others. Leading-edge technology accounts for between 70% to 80% of our total CapEx in the year, mature specialty technology between 10% to 20%, and the remaining are split between advanced packaging and EBO and some others, okay? Thank you, Rolf. Perfect. Thank you. All right. Operator, let's move on to the next participant, please. Next one, we have Sunny Lin from UBS. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. So my number one question is on 3-nanometer ramp-up. As we are going through third quarters on mass production, I think you must have a pretty good visibility for customer engagement for the coming few years. So I wonder now how should we think about the overall ramp of 3-nanometer if we compare with 5 and 7-nanometer? If we look at 5, you reach towards 18% of revenue in the second year of mass production and then about 24% of revenue in the third year.
Whereas for 3-nanometer, I think the concerns by smartphone customers have been on cost. Then the question will be if HPC is significant enough to still drive a meaningful pickup of 3-nanometer. And so it will be greatly appreciate if you could provide us any kind of thoughts. Thank you very much. Okay. So Sunny's first question is on the ramp of 3-nanometer. Her question really, I believe, is coming from a percentage of revenue contribution. She wants to know how is the ramp-up 3-nanometer? And then can it contribute to the revenue like N5, N7 in the past? Yes. As I just said, we believe N3 will be a long-lasting and large node for TSMC. Now in terms of percentage, I think it's sometimes less important because our overall corporate revenue is much, much bigger these days than before. So I think you should also take that into consideration. But dollar amount-wise, it's a much bigger node. And C.C. also said it's a multiyear strong structural demand. Yes. I am sorry, okay. Got it. Well, so I have a quick follow-up on 3-nanometer profitability. And so Wendell has provided a pretty good insight about the dilution for 2024. But historically, a new node would take about 7 to 8 quarters to get to corporate average after mass production. I understand now corporate average gross margin is also higher. But any expectations that N3 will become in line with corporate average gross margin? Yes. So Sunny's question is looking at the 3-nanometer. Her question is really that with 3-nanometer and process complexities. Sunny, you're asking really kind of reach the corporate average over time? Or is there a time line that you are expecting? Or and time line to reach. Yes. Sunny, as I just mentioned, it's becoming more challenging for the leading nodes because of the process complexity increases a lot. It applies to N3. So it will be challenging for N3. And we actually mentioned that at the beginning of last year already, it will be challenging that for N3 to reach the corporate leverage in the - in 7 to 8 quarters time frame like before. Yes. But however, part of it is really because of the higher corporate margin that we currently have. Got it. Thank you. My second question is on 2-nanometer. And so if we look at your target for 2-nanometers improvement over 3-nanometer in terms of speed and power, the upgrade seems to be actually less than 3-nanometer over 5-nanometer. So I wonder what's actually the implication of GA [ph] transition to cost versus performance. Is the target somewhat conservative? Or there is other technological challenges that we need to consider? Okay. Sunny, second was - it's really a third, but the question is on N2. She notes that the performance and the improvement seems to be less than 3-nanometer versus 5-nanometer. So could we talk more about that? Yes, let me answer the question. Sunny you have a very good observation. Yes, you are right. As I compare node to node from 5 to 3, the improvement, it becomes less from 3 to 2. But let me point it out, usually, we are talking about the performance, the speed and also the density so that the geometry shrinkage.
Now we focus on the power consumption reduction, which is still a poor node as a performance because as time goes by more and more customer, really, they are increasing towards greater power efficiency. This is very important for the data center very important for the server. And that's what we are working on. So did I answer your questions, Sunny? Got it. Thank you for the color. And good to know that you are on track to deliver a second generation of 2-nanometer in 2026. Thank you. Thank you, Sunny. Operator, let's move on to the next participant, please. Next one to ask questions, Brett Simpson from Arete. Yes. Thanks very much. And the first question is for C.C. I was interested in getting a read on the customer reception you're getting for the new variants for N3, I think you talked about N3P and 3x. Are customers still as focused on N3E or are you seeing a preference for them to migrate to the new variants such as N3P, N3X rather than the N3E. And this as a follow-on for AI, when do we actually start to see N3 adoption for N3? Thank you. Okay. So Brett's first question is looking at our 3-nanometer families and the continuous enhancements that we always have. He is asking what is the customer reception of N3P and N3X? How does this compare or cannibalize N3? And when do we expect AI related to adopt 3-nanometer family solutions? Let me answer the last one first. AI application already adopting that our N3 technology node, we continue to improve our technology, as we always do. So we have an N3E, N3P, N3X, X is the actual performance that's for very high speed, very high let me say, performance computing for some of the CPUs application. But N3Es are widely accepted by all my customer and the design starting from N3E, and we help them for some of them go to the N3P. So all together, every version, every variation, there's a lot of customer engagement right now. Okay. Thank you, C.C. And maybe just my second question for Mark. Mark, you were talking about the - building up the ecosystem in some of the overseas markets like the U.S., and you're talking about skill shortage. But can you talk about what you think the like-for-like wafer cost difference is to operate in the U.S. versus Taiwan?
I think your TSMC Founder talked previously about a 50% premium to operate in the U.S. Can you just quantify if that's - if it's likely to be that high. And then when would you expect the cash support from the U.S. Chips Act to be made available to TSMC? Thank you. Okay. So Brett, second question is for Chairman. He wants to know, in basically the cost gap, how big is the cost gap of fab in the U.S. versus in Taiwan. Founder has said 50% or more? Is it that high? And then concurrently, with the Chips Act, when or how and when do we expect to receive the incentives to support? Yes, Simpson. I think the Founder is right. I mean at this point, if we're using the current supply chain and labor cost, indeed, as that differences. However, we try to work with the U.S. administration. First of all, on the subsidy, cash subsidy and tax - investment tax credit, that is to cover the gap in the first 5 years approximately.
When the tool is depreciated, then the ecosystem becomes prominent. That is what is the material costs, chemical costs and the labor cost. And we are working with the - our supplier to set up some of the more efficient supply sites and to be lower, but the - and the U.S. administration has decided also to subsidize the supply - our suppliers. So that is still in the work. How much it can further decrease? I don't know. But I think either way, we will strengthen our pricing values and be able to keep the corporate profitability as we forecasted now. Thank you, Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Thank you. In the interest of time, operator, we'll take questions from the last two participants in the queue, please. Yes. Next one to ask question, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to go back to the gross margin. And I think you highlighted the fact that for '23, you're still tracking to 53% gross margin on a USD basis. That would imply that Q4 could be flat to up. And I just want to better understand how it's tracking. I'm not asking for a guide on Q4, but if 2023 gross margin is going to be 53% plus, so that would imply Q4 flat to up. Is that correct? All right, Mehdi. I think we'll let Wendell answer this question. But Mehdi is asking basically, are we saying that 2023 will be 53% and higher? Mehdi, we're not giving our guidance beyond this third quarter. So we're not saying what Jeff just said. What we're saying is only some of the negative factors will affect the second half of the year. As to 53% and higher, that's a long-term growth margin target for TSMC. Yes. We did not provide a guidance for 2023 specifically, Mehdi. As Wendell just said, 53% higher is our long-term target, which we believe is achievable. Do you have a second question? Okay. Thank you. Yes. Your updated guide suggests that revenues in the second half would be up 10% to 12% versus the first half. Obviously, a step-up is lower than prior expectations. What I want to better understand is how should we think about continued inventory correction among your customer versus new product ramp by some of the other customers. Is there any way you can differentiate these two trends? Okay. Mehdi is asking with our full year guidance, it implies a more mild second half seasonality. So he wants to know how much strength of the new customer product launches is offset by continued inventory correction. Sort of if we can provide more color on that. That's a tough question to answer. Mehdi, your observation is right. Our second half seasonality is more minor than previous years. But of course, we have N3 ramp up and for the new product launch. But what is the impact, how to separate them. No, I cannot share too much of the detail of that. Okay, Mehdi. Thank you. Operator, then let's move on to the last participant, please. Yes. The last one on queue is Charles Shi from Needham. Thanks. Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. I have two questions. The first question is I want to ask about AI, especially around TSMC's monetization of AI trend. We did hear some commentary that for certain AI applications, TSMCs is selling chips for a few hundred bucks, but TSMC customers can actually sell for 10 bucks, thousands of bucks to their end customers. So I mean, some investors I spoke with really still – it pain them to see TSMC to create an advanced technology to probably give the greater value than this.
So the question really is how does TSMC think about maybe a monetization going forward for the capability to produce all these AI chips. And really I want to tie back to one thing management mentioned in the prepared remarks, the AI growth, 50% CAGR, how much of that is volume? And how much of that could be the pricing driven IN terms of TSMC expected the growth over the next few years in areas? Thank you. Okay. Charles, his question. First is on AI. Again, basically, he's asking about monetization or capturing value, let's say. He notes that TSMC, we may be selling chips for a few hundred dollars, but our customers are able to sell it for tens of thousands or even more. So is TSMC giving away too much of the value? Can we better sell our value or monetize to capture greater value with the AI trend? Well, Charles, I used to make a joke on my customers say that I [indiscernible] a few hundred dollars of a chip and then he sold it back to me with USD 200,000. But let me say that, we are happy to see customers doing very well. And if customers do well, TSMC does well. And of course, we work with them and we share our value to them. And fundamentally, we want to say that we are able to address and capture a major portion of the market in terms of a semiconductor component in AI. Did I answer your question? Yes. What about the part about 50% CAGR, how much of that is volume? And should we expect some pricing element in that, the long-term growth? Yes. So the second part is about close to 50% CAGR for AI - sorry, server with AI processor. How much of that is volume? How much of that is price? We cannot separate out, but let me share with you again, we talk to the customers because we have a major share of all the leading-edge technology node. So we know that we can make our judgment and so we forecast a 50% CAGR. How much of that is on the front end, back end or others? I am not able to share with you about it. But let me assure you that TSMC is going to capture a major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component. Okay, Charles? Thank you. Can I ask you a second question? Last question. Yes, no problem. Last one. May I ask about the CapEx. I think I heard a comment that maybe some window about our dollar amount. CapEx stock is going to level up from here. And I think the management used to point us analysts to look at the 2010 to 2013 period with a high capital tenancy. CapEx actually went up $3 billion, $4 billion per year to 10. And actually, after that, TSMC CapEx did a level off around $10 billion level for roughly 5 years until 2019. By telling us the CapEx is probably going to level off, are you telling us or are you alluding to maybe there will be some steady state CapEx numbers going forward, maybe starting from '24 or '25, around NT30 billion-ish [ph] level. That's just a clarification on that comment to level it up. Thank you. Okay. So Charles, second question is on our CapEx. He wants to know capital spending starting to level off. I think Wendell said in the next several years. So not any specific, but what does that mean? Is it going to stay around the 30-some level? Or what does that mean by spending leveling off? Yes. The - Charles, as I mentioned in the past few years, our CapEx increased dramatically from NT10 billion to NT36 billion last year. As we start to harvest those investments, the increase in CapEx will be slower than before. That's what I mean by leveling off. Okay. All right, Charles. Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Okay. Operator, this concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the call will be accessible within 30 minutes from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which you can be find and available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. So thank you for joining us today.

TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. [Operator Instructions] 
The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2023, followed by our guidance for the fourth quarter 2023. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC CEO, Dr. C. C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for the Q&A. 
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release. 
And now, I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter 2023. 
Third quarter revenue increased 13.7% sequentially in NT dollars or 10.2% in U.S. dollars as our third quarter business was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Gross margin increased 0.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.3%, mainly reflecting higher capacity utilization, partially offset by the margin dilution from N3 ramp. 
Total operating expenses accounted for 12.6% of net revenue as compared to 12.1% in the second quarter mainly due to higher R&D expenses to support our 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development. Operating margin was 41.7%, down 0.3 percentage point from the previous quarter.
Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 8.14 and ROE was 25.8%. 
Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 6% of wafer revenue in the third quarter while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 16%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 59% of wafer revenue. 
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our third quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 33% to account for 39%. IoT increased 24% to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 24% to account for 5%. And DCE decreased 1% to account for 2%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.55 trillion or USD 48 billion.
On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD 159 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 95 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD 59 billion in accrued liabilities and others. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 30 billion, of which TWD 10 billion from new issuance and TWD 20 billion from foreign exchange rate movement. 
On financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days increased 3 days to 35 days while days of inventory decreased 3 days to 96 days. 
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 295 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 227 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for fourth quarter '22 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 35 billion to TWD 1.31 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled $7.1 billion. 
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between USD 18.8 billion and USD 19.6 billion, which represents a 11.1% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%.  This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our third quarter '23 and fourth quarter '23 profitability. Compared to second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 20 basis points sequentially to 54.3%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. 
Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago by 80 basis points, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to decline by 1.8 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily due to the continued margin dilution from the steep ramp of our 3-nanometer technology. 
As a reminder, 6 factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. To manage our profitability in the next several years, we will work diligently on our internal cost improvement while continuing to strategically sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Next, let me talk about our 2023 CapEx and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and have tightened up our capital spending throughout the year where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 CapEx to be approximately USD 32 billion. Out of the approximately $32 billion CapEx for 2023, about 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies; about 20% will be spent for specialty technologies; and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask-making and others. 
Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by low 20s percentage year-over-year in 2023 as compared to our January forecast of approximately 30% year-over-year increase.
Despite the near-term inventory cycle, our commitment to support customers' growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term structure market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of USD 17.3 billion, in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the third quarter was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' ongoing inventory adjustment.
Moving into fourth quarter 2023. While AI-related demand continues to be strong, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the fourth quarter to be supported by the continued strong ramp of our 3-nanometer technology, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment. 
On the inventory side, we expect the fabless semiconductor inventory to have continuously reduced in the third quarter. However, due to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand recovery in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. Thus, we expect the inventory digestion to continue in the fourth quarter.
Having said that, we are observing some early sign of demand stabilization in the PC and smartphone end market. Together with such level of inventory control, we forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to further reduce and exit 4Q '23 at a healthier level. 
Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. As we have said before, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. 
In Europe, after conducting extensive due diligence, we announced our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany focusing on automotive and industrial applications. We have received a strong commitment to support this project from our JV partners; the European Commission government; and German federal state and city governments. This fab will utilize 22- and 28-nanometer and 12/16-nanometer technologies for semiconductor wafer fabrication. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in second half 2024 and production is targeted to begin in late 2027. 
In Arizona, we are receiving strong support from the city of Phoenix, State of Arizona and U.S. federal government and continue to develop positive relationship. We work closely with our local trade and union partners. We are making good progress on the fab infrastructure, utilities and equipment installation issues in our first fab and the situation is improving. We have also begun early preparation for our Arizona fab operations and hired close to 1,100 local TSMC employees so far. Many of them has been brought to Taiwan for extensive hands-on experience in our fab, so that they can further their technical skills while being immersed in TSMC operation environment and culture. 
We continue to target volume production of N4 process technology in first half 2025 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing, quality and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan. 
In Japan, we built a specialty technology fab, which will utilized 12- and 16-nanometer and 22- and 28-nanometer process technologies. We have hired approximately 800 local TSMC employees so far with the majority having similarly been brought to Taiwan for hands-on experience. Equipment moving has begun this month and volume production is on track for late 2024. 
In China, we have recently received an extension from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security to continue our operation in Nanjing. We are currently in the process of applying for validated end user authorization and expect to receive permanent authorization in the near future. 
From a cost perspective, the initial costs of overseas fabs are higher than TSMC fab in Taiwan due to, first, smaller fab scale; second, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and third, the early stage of semiconductor ecosystem overseas as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan. TSMC's responsibility is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize the return for our shareholders. Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which include the value of geographic flexibility.  We will also work closely with government to secure their support.
At the same time, we are leveraging our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume, economies of scale to continuously drive our costs down. By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs and still deliver the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25%. We remain firm in our commitment to maximize the value for our shareholders. 
Now let me talk about N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress, our 3-nanometer technology, the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. N3 is already in volume production with good yield and we are seeing a strong ramp in the second half of this year, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. We reaffirm N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023, and we expect a much higher percentage in 2024 supported by robust demand from multiple customers. 
N3E will leverage the strong foundation of N3 to further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield and provide complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed qualification and achieved performance and yield targets and will start volume production in fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to provide further enhancement of N3 technology, including N3P and N3X. 
With our strategy of continuous enhancement of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-yield demand from our customers and we are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. 
Finally, I will talk about the N2 stages. The recent surge in AI-related demand supports our already strong conviction that demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. The value of our technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and increasing toward greater power efficiency.
In addition, as process technology complexity increases, the lead time and engagement with customers also start much earlier. As a result, we are observing a strong level of customer interest and engagement at our N2 similar to or higher than N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and smartphone applications. 
Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 will adopt nanosheet transistor structure, which has demonstrated excellent power efficiency. N2 will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. 
As part of N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. We are targeting backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership well into the future. 
This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention. Thank you, C. C. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] Now let's begin the Q&A session. The first one to ask questions, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Congratulations on a great result, and thanks for the details on N3 and N2. My first question is on the technology leadership. Given we are hearing a lot of competitive messaging from your U.S. IDM competitor/customer in the last few months, Intel seems to think that they will be getting into technology -- or process technology leadership in 2025.
Just wanted to hear what does TSMC think of Intel's claim. And when TSMC thinks about customer engagement, do you feel you will lose a little bit of market share to Intel when it comes to the N2 or the first generation of nanosheet transistors? Or you think your very high market share in N3 will continue into N2? That's my first question. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is about technology leadership and competition with, I think, particularly IDM. He notes this IDM is very -- messaging about taking over process technology leadership from TSMC. And so Gokul's question is, how do we see this? Are we concerned that we will lose market share at nanosheet or N2 to this IDM given their claims of process -- regaining process technology leadership. Is that correct, Gokul? Yes, that's right. Well, Gokul, this is C. C. Wei. Let me answer your question with a very simple answer is that no, but what I will state a little bit long. Actually, we do not underestimate any of our competitors or take them lightly. Having said that, our internal assessment shows that our N3P, now I repeat again, N3P technology, demonstrated comparable PPA to 18A, my competitor's technology, but with an earlier time to market, better technology, maturity and much better cost. 
In fact, let me repeat again, our 2-nanometer technology without backside power is more advanced than both N3P and 18A and will be semiconductor industry's most advanced technology when it is introduced in 2025. Does that answer your question, Gokul? Okay. That's quite clear. Could you talk -- also talk about -- my second question is, could we talk a little bit about the AI-related demand. You've seen a pretty strong demand on the data center side and you talked about AI being about 6% of revenues this year, mostly on the data center side.
Are we starting to see more engagement on AI demand on edge devices? Based on TSMC's expectations, is this going to be a big growth driver in the next 1 to 2 years for TSMC's leading-edge AI devices -- sorry, AI on edge devices? Do you think that, that is a bigger driver for you? Okay. Thank you, Gokul. So Gokul's second question is on AI-related demand. He notes, of course, that we have talked last time also about our AI-related demand outlook and particularly focused on what we call server AI processors or Gokul referring to data centers.
So his question is really more about on-the-edge devices. Are we starting to see AI-related demand for edge devices? Do we expect this to be a big growth driver in the next 1 to 2 years for our leading-edge technologies as well? Well, the answer is also very simple, yes. We do see some activities from customers who add AI capability in end devices such as smartphone and PCs, [ so new growth ] engine and AI and PC, whatever. And we certainly hope that this one will add to the course, help TSMC more strengthen under our AI's business. So do you see that happen in the next 1 year? Or is it something that will happen in a more lower term horizon? Just wanted to understand when to think about the cadence of this growth. Okay. Let me answer briefly. It started right now, and we will expect that the more and more customer will put that AI's capability into the end devices, into their product. Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. So my first question is about the cycle recovery. So much appreciate about your comments about end demand. So my question is about when do you expect that there will be an uptick of the fab utilization, assuming demand is stabilizing and also inventory get back to the healthy level? Because it's just very hard to believe your fab utilization outside of leading edge will stay at only 70%, 80%. So first question is about, do you see that overall fab utilization to pick up anytime soon? Okay. So Charlie, I think your first question is sort of, if I'm correct, around the cycle and in terms of -- how do we see the cycle and the recovery? When -- do we see the fab utilization picking up, which really is a function of, I guess, do we see the cycle bottoming out and when do we expect a recovery. Is that correct? Yes. Well, Charlie, this is C. C. Wei again. Let me answer your question. As I said, we do observe some early signs of demand stabilization in PC and smartphone end markets. Those 2 segments are the biggest segment for TSMC's business. We want to say that 2024 will be a very healthy growth. But right now, did we see the bottom? Very close, very close.
We want to -- I cannot give you a number, but -- because it's too early to call it a sharp rebound. But even with the macro environment remain uncertain, we're [ waiting ] customers' inventory control in first half of 2024, having said that, we already said that we are strong technology leadership and a broad customer base. And those two are unique and specific to TSMC, enable our customers to win business in their end market and TSMC continues to deliver healthy growth. And that's why we can do better than overall industry. And that's why we have confidence that we will have healthier growth next year. Okay. Okay. Yes. So just want to kind of verify because we do see some green shoots and some rush orders to wafer foundry sector.
But second question is also about AI. My question is that over the past 3 months, do you see any upward revision of the forecast maybe from the GPU or just the custom chip?
And I know it's a very, very recent, right, just 2 days ago, U.S. put some additional export control on the AI shipment to China. Do you think that, that is going to have any kind of near-term or long-term impact to your AI [ semi ] revenue growth assumption? Okay. Thank you, Charlie. So Charlie's second question is related to AI, two-parter. First, do we see over the last 3 months, I think his words were an upward revision in the demand from AI in the last 3 months. And then he wants to know, given the recent additional regulations announced, what would the impact to the AI demand be to TSMC, both for the short term and the long term? Charlie, the AI demand continues to grow stronger and stronger. So from TSMC's point of view, now we have about -- we have a capacity limitation to support them -- to support the demand. We are working hard to increase the capacity to meet their demand, that's for one thing.
Now U.S. government put a new regulation and to -- for some of the product cannot be shipped to Mainland China. However,  it is just for a couple of days, we are still evaluating the -- we are still doing our assessment. But so far, we can tell you that the impact to TSMC is limited and manageable, at least for the short term. For the long term, we are still evaluating what is the consequence. Got it. So actually, there was one embedded question about the custom chip. So may I know your perspective about this custom chip, long-term may kind of gain share or outgrow the GPU products. So what was your assumption for this custom chip in terms of the real contribution within AI or to TSMC, may I ask as a follow-up? Okay. Let me answer. Whether customer developed the CPU, GPU, AI accelerator or ASIC for all the type for AI applications, the commonality is that they all require usage of leading-edge technology with stable yield delivery to support larger die size and a strong foundry design ecosystem. All of those are TSMC's strengths. So we are able to address and capture a major portion of the market in terms of a semiconductor component in AI. Next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I think the question is try to ask about the outlook for next 2 years. I think -- I do recall that management mentioned about like 15% to 20% revenue CAGR from '21 to '26. The smartphone business is supposed to be in line or slightly below the corporate average in terms of the growth rate, but the smartphone business was down meaningfully in 2023. Do we expect to see a sharp rebound for the smartphone business to get back to the corporate average in terms of growth rate?
Also, the management also mentioned that the backend business will grow in line with the corporate average. Will we see a much stronger growth from the backend business in the coming 2 years? Okay. So Bruce's question really is looking at we have -- indeed, you're right, Bruce we have said we will grow between 15% to 20% revenue CAGR in U.S. dollar terms from 2021 to 2026. So Bruce's question wants to break down the components here to look at smartphone, in particular. Given that it has been a slower-growing market these last few years, how do we see the growth of the smartphone market the next 1 to 2 years in the context of this CAGR.
And then also, I think Bruce is also asking about the backend growth. We have said previously it will grow slightly faster than the corporate average. What is the current expectation now also for the next 1 to 2 years. Is that correct, Bruce? Yes. Bruce, this is Wendell. Yes, in the next 2 to 3 years, backing up to '21 to '26, we still expect that the smartphone, as a whole, will grow slightly slower than the corporate average. We still think that HPC will be the strongest one and will be the major growth contributor to our multiyear growth. This is your first question.
As to the growth of backend business, we still expect that the backend business, as a whole, will grow slightly faster than the corporate average in the 5-year time period. I see. So the next question is for the technology cadence. I mean, for TSMC, for revenue contribution for 5-nanometer, we start to see the meaningful revenue contribution for 5-nanometer starting in the third quarter 2020 and 3-nanometer is third quarter 2023. So the cadence, it looks like, is longer for 3 nanometers versus 5-nanometer and 7 nanometers.
What is the technology cadence moving forward? Are we able to see a meaningful revenue contribution of 2-nanometer in 2-year time frame or 3 years' time frame? I think the technology migration cadence is an important indicator still. Okay. Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question, again, as he said, is around the technology cadence. He notes that 5-nanometer started contributing revenue in 3Q '20, but I think you're saying 3-nanometer's revenue contribution in 3Q '23. So the cadence is growing longer to kind of 3 years between 5 and 3.
So what will be the technology cadence in the future? And thus, for 2-nanometer, when should we expect meaningful revenue as well. Is that correct, Bruce? That's correct. Okay. Bruce, let me answer the question. I think that we developed the technology to meet the customers' demand. That's the first priority to us. But then different customers may have different product schedule consideration. And as time goes by, the technology complexity actually become more and more complicated and our customer will design their product and react to the market situation.
So let me answer the question that's -- in a very simple way: TSMC's technology cadence remain constant and to support our customers' growth. But whether we got the same amount or same percentage of the revenue, it will depend on customers' product schedule. But the follow-up question is that if the customer doesn't really need the advanced technology as fast as before, maybe we slow it down a bit, which will make better returns, right? So Bruce's follow-up is, so if the customers do not need the leading node as fast or as soon as before, then slow down the cadence, does that mean we will see better returns? Well, we don't slow down our technology development per se. We might slow down our capacity expansion according to customer's demand. Did I answer your question, Bruce? That's what we are doing right now. I see. Understand. The next one, we have Laura Chen from Citi. I think my question is also similar to what Bruce mentioned about the capacity expansion plan. As we see that healthier inventory situation right now and at the same time the most advanced process now depends on customers' demand, so just want to get your feeling about the overall CapEx outlook or capacity outlook into the next 2 years. Do you feel that we'll be better to resume the year-on-year CapEx next year or later, considering there's still quite strong demand on N3, N2 ramp-up? At the same time, the most advanced node seems you will see maybe 2x more expensive on N2 versus N3. So my question is just about the future capacity expansion. Yes. Okay. So Laura's first question again is on the capacity expansion plan. She notes that, of course, the inventory, as we said, is becoming healthier but also with N3 and N2. So she really wants to know what is the CapEx and capacity outlook planned for the next 1 to 2 years. Right. Laura, this is Wendell. C. C. is just mentioned our capacity plan will really depend on the customers' product plan.
Now in terms of CapEx, what we can see now is that we, in the past few years, have invested very heavily to capture the growth in the next few years. And as we begin to harvest those investments, we expect our -- the increase of our CapEx to be leveling off in the next few years. That doesn't mean the dollar amount is going to reduce. But the capital intensity is expected to decline in the next few years. That's what we can see at this moment. I recall that previously, we mentioned about like we target longer term to back to like mid-30s for our CapEx intensity. So is any possibility we see or we achieve that target next year? It's -- first of all, it's not a target. It's a forecast based on the customers' demand. And secondly, it's like 3 or 5 years out. It's not the immediate next year. Okay. Very clear. And also my second question is about N2 progress. Appreciate C. C.'s previous sharing on the progress and also the backside power time line. I'm just wondering that what would be the most challenging part if we migrate to like a backside power?
And also since the transistor density will become totally different on nanosheet, so I'm just wondering the clients' migration or intention to adopt the most advanced nodes into next 2, 3 years? And what will be the most challenging in technology perspective? Okay. So Laura, let me make sure I got this right. So your second question is about N2 and you want to know with the adoption of backside power rail, what is the most challenging part from a technology perspective and then how do we see the customer adoption? Yes. Correct. Laura, I'll answer that as technology moving into more and more advanced node, the challenge is always there. Technology complexity increase dramatically. But we can do it, no doubt about it. And we still remain the technology leadership in this industry.
If you ask me what is the most challenging part, I would say it's cost. I mean, that's -- you look at it today, inflation, everything, and the tool have become more and more expensive. Although we can do it on time to meet customer's requirement, our challenge right now actually, I would say, number one, cost. I want to reduce the cost so more customers can afford it. But even with that, actually, we have a lot of customer interested and engaged with TSMC today. Actually, it's probably higher than the N3 at a similar stage. Okay. Did I answer your question -- yes. Okay. Yes, very clear. Right now, we have Brett Simpson from Arete Research. I had a question for C. C. regarding the hyperscalers. Major U.S. hyperscalers are hiring a lot of chip designers at the moment and looking to make their own AI silicon going direct to TSMC, much like Apple has done over the years. Are you -- is TSMC generally supportive of this trend or not? And can you give us your perspective as to whether hyperscalers have the in-house IP and skills to cut out the ASIC suppliers or not and go direct to TSMC? Okay. Brett, thank you. So Brett's first question is looking at his observation, U.S. hyperscale companies are hiring a lot of people to do AI custom chips, silicon and working directly or coming directly to work with TSMC. So his question is, is TSMC support such efforts? And how do we see such type of customers, I guess? Is that your question, Brett? Yes. And generally, just share your perspective on how you see this part of the business developing at TSMC. All right, Brett. Okay, those are hyperscalers. I don't comment on the specific customer. But all we know or our fundamental rule is whether customer develop the CPU, GPU, AI accelerator or ASIC for their own application or for any purpose in the AI area, we will support them, actually. And because of our technology leadership and our good manufacturing, so we are able to address and capture a major portion of the market. And so you are asking whether we support it or not, we support every customer all over the world. Okay. That's very clear. And maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of the areas in the quarter that were weaker than expected, namely, 7-nanometer, I think it's half year-on-year; and also automotive that saw a decline sequentially, a meaningful decline sequentially. Can you just help us understand how you build back up 7-nanometer? What led to the weakness? And what's happening in automotive? And how do you assess prospects for automotive over the next 6, 9 months or so? Okay. So 2 parts to Brett's question. Maybe I'll start with the second, but anyway, looking at automotive demand and the weakness in the past quarter, how do we see the automotive demand.
And then also his question is about 7-nanometer, also year-on-year sharp revenue decrease. So how do we see the outlook for 7-nanometer as well. Well, let me answer the question on automotive demand. In fact, in the past 3 years, automotive demand is very strong. And we deliver whatever they asked. And today, I think the automotive demand already entered the inventory adjustment mode in the second half of 2023. However, we still expect the automotive demand will increase again in 2024 because more and more EV, more and more functionality being added to automotive and that's what we saw.
Now talking about the N7, the 7-nanometer technology, why we have such a low utilization or the revenue decreased. It's go beyond our initial -- our original plan because of we expect the N7 to be very -- fully utilized even now, but it is not. Let me answer the question because of we suddenly have -- in 10 years, the smartphone demand dropped dramatically from about 1.4 billion units to about 1.1 billion now. So that exactly, in this time frame, the N7's utilization has been impacted and followed by one major customer who delayed their product introduction. And so that's why we have a low utilization.
But saying that, we are confident to backfill our 7-, 6-nanometer capacity with additional wave of specialty demand from consumer, RF, connectivity and other applications and will return to a healthy level of utilization over the next several years. This is very similar to a situation that we have, 28-nanometer back in 2018 and 2019 time frame, okay? At the beginning, it was underutilized for a period of time and we worked hard to -- with our customer and then for developers some specialty technologies and then now we have to expand 28-nanometer specialty capacity. That's the same kind of a story. Brett, did I answer your question? Yes. Next one to ask questions, Brad Lin from Bank of America. So first of all, congrats on the strong results and then also the impressive gross margin. So I have 2 questions. One is on the end device AI, HAI and the other is on the CPO. So appreciate the management's constructive comments and growth outlook on the HAI.
So besides the, well, interesting engagement with the clients, what are the implications for the wafer consumption for the firm? And also, eyeing on the computing power and energy consumption angle on the end device with AI in the -- additional AI functions, should we expect it to reaccelerate the node migration for the end devices? That's my first question. Okay. So Brad's first question is about edge and end device AI. He wants to know what is the implications for wafer consumption?
And then with the increasing need for energy efficiency and power, he is wondering does this reaccelerate or increase the node for -- I guess, his words is node migration or adoption of leading-edge technologies. Well, the edge device start to -- that's including smartphone and PC, start to incorporate the AI functionality inside. We observed some of the newer engines has been added increasingly. So the die size will increase even the unit did not increase dramatically. But the die size is in mid-teens -- or no, not. I mean, mid-single digit is the die size increase so far. And I expect that this kind of trend will continue. And so more and more application of the -- on the AI side, what be incorporated into those kind of edge device. And that one need a very power-efficient chips to put into the edge device, especially when it is mobile.
So I do expect -- for my own perspective, I do expect that my customer will move into the leading edge node more and more quickly to compete in the market. So -- well, so a bit of a follow-up is that, well, now it accounts for some mid-single digit of the die size incremental for a chip. So does that -- or are we seeing that to enlarge to something like mid-teens, or well, even bigger in the -- well, mid- to long term? So Brad's quick follow-up is if the AI portion is kind of mid-single digit now, how should we expect -- can we expect mid-teens or what type of percentage in a few years' time? Well, I will answer the question. Actually, we see the increase in the die size, but we cannot nail down the, we say, the mid-single digit, but I expect it to start to increase. And whether that will increase our forecast and our growth or something, it's still too early to say to -- at this moment. Yes, Brad. We are still quantifying the impact from this development. So we're maintaining the previous statement that we expect it to grow to about in 5 years about mid-single digits -- I'm sorry, mid-teens of our revenue. Yes. I think, Brad, probably just very simply, as we said, edge AI, we do see some activity. It will drive silicon content, but this will occur over time, okay? And we don't have any quantitative number to share, all right? Got it. Okay. What is your second question? Okay. So the second question is on CPO. So basically, we have learned that TSMC is doing quite well, also leading the industry in CPO or so-called silicon photonics, and has introduced a platform to clients with the technology. So may we learn the opportunities and implications of the new technology for the industry and for our firm? And also, should we expect the platform to offer additional competitive advantage for TSMC in the mid to long run? So Brad, your second question is on silicon photonics. Is that correct? Yes. So he wants to know our positioning or progress on silicon photonics, how important is this and will this be a competitive advantage for TSMC going forward in the future. Okay. Let me answer that question. Silicon photonics actually is growing its importance because of just a larger amount of data need to be collected, processed and transferred in an energy-efficient manner. Silicon photonics tends to be the best fit to that role. And TSMC have been working on silicon photonics for years, and most importantly, we're collaborating with multiple leading customer to support their innovations in this field.
It takes a lot of time to develop the technology and to build the capacity. And when we increase the volume production, we believe that TSMC's silicon photonics will be the best technology and -- when customer roll out all their innovations. But as I said, it's gradually increasing in their activity and gradually increasing their demand as of today. Got it. Next one, we have Sunny Lin from UBS. So my first question is on advanced packaging. Incrementally, we are hearing more customer interest in the adoption to achieve better heterogeneous integrations. But want to get your thoughts on what could be the potential impact of customers relying a bit more on packaging to improve the system performance and perhaps less on the process migration given cost considerations.
Meanwhile, SoIC has been introduced for quite a while, whereas the customer adoption still seems to be limited at this point. And so when should we expect a more meaningful pickup of SoIC? And what could be the major catalyst? Okay. So Sunny, sorry, I may have missed a little bit of the first part. But I think her question is on overall advanced packaging. Looking at this trend and the move to more, of course, heterogeneous integration, what are the cost implications and how does this advanced packaging work go together with the process technology standpoint? And then also a question about the update or progress of SoIC. Is that correct, Sunny? Well, so maybe if I may clarify, but -- so for the first part, I wonder if customers may consider relying a bit more on packaging whereas slowing down a bit on the process migration because of increasing costs. Okay. So she's asking, will customers -- because of the increasing cost of the process technologies, will customers rely more on advanced packaging as a result. Let me answer that. It's not because of increasing of the cost in the more advanced node. And actually, they tried to -- our customers tried to maximize the system performance. That's the major portion. That, including the kind of speed improvement or the power consumption decrease, all those kind of things, put all together, maybe cost is also part of the consideration which we noticed about. And so more and more customers are moving into the very advanced technology node and they start to adopt the [ chipless ] approaches.
And so no matter what, TSMC provide industry-leading solution in both very leading technology and also very advanced packaging technology and to work with our customer for their product and have a best system performance.
And the other one is you are asking about the SoIC, when it will become a high volume and a more substantial revenue for TSMC. It's coming. It's coming. Actually, the customer already ready to announce their new product, which are widely adopt. And I expect starting from now and next year, the SoIC will generate revenue and become one of the faster-growing advanced packaging solution in the next few years. Got it. If I may, a quick follow-up. Three months ago, you had a target to double your CoWoS capacities. And just now you mentioned AI demand continued to surprise on the upside. So wonder if there's any update on your CoWoS capacity expansion? Okay. So I will take this as your second question, Sunny, but she's asking about CoWoS expansion. We had said that we will double the capacity 3 months ago. Can we provide an update on the overall CoWoS capacity. And I guess, CapEx and capacity go hand-in-hand, what is our plan. Well, Sunny, the last time we said that we will double our CoWoS capacity, we are working very hard to increase the capacity more than double, but today is limited by my supplier's capability or their capacity. So we still maintain that we will double our CoWoS capacity by the end of 2024. But the total output actually is more than double from 2023 to 2024 because of a very high demand in -- from our customer. So actually then this kind of a trend will continue to increase our CoWoS capacity to support our customers even into 2025. Next one, please welcome Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. I understand there are a number of new products that you're ramping into year-end and into first half of '24 in various -- for various end markets. And I want to understand how the ramp of these new products are to impact the seasonality. Could we see a scenario where in the first half, the ramp of these new products, especially like the leading edge, to somewhat offset the seasonal factors? Any thoughts there? And I have a follow-up. All right. Mehdi. Well, Mehdi's first question is in terms of new products, which, of course, customer products, we don't comment on, but he said we are ramping products into the second half and so how will this ramp of new products go is into -- as we go into first half '24? And can this offset or mitigate some of the seasonality. No. Let me rephrase that, contribution of customers' new products. And how would that impact -- or how could that offset seasonal factors. Yes. Mehdi, I don't think we can comment on specific customer products, but I can tell you that we're not seeing any dramatic change in the seasonality as of now. Okay. Because I'm looking at your year -- calendar '23, and given your Q4 guide, you're actually doing better than what you guided 3 months ago. Firstly, you said revenues could be down 10% U.S. dollar and now it could actually be down high single digit. Is that a combination of a stronger new product ramp and better pricing? Is that a fair assessment? Okay. So Mehdi is really looking at -- he rightly notes that 3 months ago we said this year we'll decline around 10% in U.S. dollar term. Now with the fourth quarter implied guidance, it's slightly better. So he wants to know what is the implication or behind this. Well, let me give you one simple reason: because our ramp-up of N3, because of the demand of N3 is strong, so we ramped up quickly to meet customers' demand. So the final result is better than we expected 3 months ago. Yes. And we have also said that strong ramp of N3 will continue in next year, okay? That's about all the seasonality color we can give. Got you. Okay. And then perhaps, if I were to ask a second question. I just want to better understand your view on your customers' inventory correction. We're reaching the bottom where we don't have any visibility on how quickly they're going to refresh inventory. The slope of the recovery is still not clear. Did I understand you correctly? So Mehdi's second question, he would like to clarify. So are we saying that customers' inventory is reaching or approaching the bottom, but the slope of the inventory is not clear. Is that what we are saying? Okay. I'll answer the question. Actually, in these couple months, we start to see the demand stabilized in the PC and smartphone end market. And in fact, we see some kind of an urgent PO ask for more device to be shipped to their place to meet the demand. That give us a hint of their inventory control already become more -- healthier than we thought.
So in terms of uncertain macro, it probably will continue but our expectation is very close to a healthy condition. So that's why we say we can expect 2024 to be healthy growth year for TSMC. Mehdi, did I answer your question? Great. Next one to ask question is Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. I have two of them. First one is on gross margin.  When do you expect N3 to reach corporate average gross margin?
And as you look into next year, as more mature node capacity comes online across the industry, how to think about mature node gross margins also? And I have a follow-up after that. Okay. So Krish's first question is on gross margin. When do we expect 3-nanometer -- or N3, I should say, to reach the corporate average gross margin? And how do we see the gross margin trend for the more mature nodes. Yes. Krish, in the past, our leading nodes normally reach gross margins -- corporate margin in about 8 quarters. But as we progress with more and more leading nodes, it will become more and more challenging because of several reasons.
Well, first of all, our corporate margin is higher than before. And secondly, the leading node, as I just said, is becoming more and more complex. And also, in the past few years, the inflation pressure that was not expected also contribute the higher cost in the N3.
So it's going to be pretty challenging for future leading nodes to reach corporate margin as in before -- like before in the same time frame.
The mature nodes. I can tell you that our mature nodes are -- the gross margins are really congregated around the corporate average in a pretty narrow band because we focus on specialty technology. It's not a commodity capacity. Yes. That's very helpful. And then I'll -- and then as a follow-up. On Arizona, you mentioned that you'd hired about 1,100 local employees. I'm kind of curious, is that critical mass enough for you to start 4-nanometer production? Or do you have another target level of employees before they can actually start getting this production since you're still maintaining the output to being first half of 2025? Okay. So thank you, Krish. So Krish's second question is about our first fab in Arizona. He notes that we have said we hired 1,100 local employees. So his question, is this enough critical mass or enough people basically to support the ramp of the first fab as we planned, as we said today in first half '25. Of course. We continue to hire the local talent to join TSMC's fab in Arizona. So when we start to have a volume production, we are confident that we will have enough resources to support our ramp-up in Arizona. The last one to ask question, Charles Shi from Needham. First off, I really want to congratulate TSMC for delivering good results for Q3 and very good guidance for Q4. But I want to really call out the reported revenue for 5-nanometer in the third quarter. It looks like you are showing some really good countercyclical strength and probably a record high.
I want to understand the rebound in the 5-nanometer business in Q3. Is that going to be more in the following quarters? And what's behind that? And relative -- let's say, your expectation like 3 to 6 months ago when you were reducing the '23 outlook, is 5-nanometer doing better than expected? And how has the demand trended in the last 2, 3 months for 5-nanometer? Okay. So Charles' first question is about 5-nanometer. He's asking in the very near term, he notes that he saw very strong sequential revenue increase in the third quarter so he's wondering what is driving this. And then he's asking about what is the outlook for the next 3 to 6 months for 5-nanometer specifically. Yes. Charles, I can share with you the increase in revenue, N5, in the third quarter mainly comes from 2 platforms, HPC and smartphone. HPC also includes the AI-related demand. Smartphone, basically, customers -- some customers' product seasonalities.
Now forward-looking wise, I'm not going to share with you, but we will tell you in January what actual the next quarter N5 revenue will be the overall revenue. The overall revenue. We don't provide revenue by process node, okay? What's your second question, Charles? Yes. The other question is about CapEx. It sounds like that you're expecting CapEx on absolute dollar might still grow going forward. I know that's a long-term comment. But I look at the near term, TSMC CapEx seems to be running at USD 7 billion per quarter in the second half '23, which kind of is at $28 billion annualized run rate.
But if we are expecting total CapEx for '24 to grow in dollar term over '23, it seems like you're expecting CapEx ramp in 2024. Maybe that's your planning for some of the CapEx ramp in '24. Is that the right way to think about the CapEx? Is $7 billion really like the really bottom level run rate for TSMC CapEx at this point? All right. So Charles' second question is also -- is on CapEx. Basically, he's saying given the guidance he's looking at our CapEx, it's running at about USD 7 billion run rate. So he is assuming -- or although we do not comment on '24, he's assuming if next year's CapEx dollar amount is going to increase, but if we're running at $7 billion run rate, does that imply $28 billion, how should he reconcile this. Charles, every year, the CapEx is invested based on the future opportunity to growth and we invested to capture those future opportunities. Too early to talk about 2024, really. We will share the guidance with you in January quarterly release. Okay. All right. Thank you, Charles. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session.

And now I would like to turn the microphone over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and recap of full year 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2024.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% sequentially in NT dollar or 13.6% in U.S. dollars, as our fourth quarter business was supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology. Gross margin decreased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to margin dilution from 3-nanometer ramp.
Operating margin decreased 0.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.6%, slightly ahead of our guidance, mainly due to operating leverage on higher revenue. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD 9.21 and ROE was 28.1%. Now let me move on to revenue by technology.
The 3-nanometer process technology contributed to 15% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue.
On a full year basis, 3-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 6% of 2023 wafer revenue, 5-nanometer was 33% and 7-nanometer was 19%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 17% quarter-over-quarter to account for 43% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 27% to account for 43%. IoT decreased 29% to account for 5%. Automotive increased 13% to account for 5%. And DCE decreased 35% to account for 2%. On a full year basis, smartphone, IoT, DCE decreased 8%, 17% and 16%, respectively. HPC remained flat, while automotive increased 15% in 2023. Overall, HPC accounted for 43% of our 2023 revenue; smartphone, 38%; IoT, 8%; and automotive, 6%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.7 trillion or USD 55 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 56 billion, mainly due to the decrease in accounts payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable days decreased 4 days to 31 days, while days of inventory also declined 11 days to 85 days, primarily due to higher 3-nanometer wafer shipment.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD 395 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 170 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 78 billion for the first quarter '23 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 154 billion to TWD 1.47 trillion at the end of the quarter.  In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 5.24 billion.
Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2023. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership enable TSMC to outperform the foundry industry. Our revenue decreased 8.7% in U.S. dollar terms to USD 69 billion or decreased 4.5% in NT terms to TWD 2.16 trillion. Gross margin decreased 5.2 percentage points to 54.4%, mainly reflecting lower overall capacity utilization in 3-nanometer ramp, partially offset by a more favorable foreign exchange rate.
To extend our technology leadership, we continue to expand our R&D investment in 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development despite a lower revenue base in 2023. Thus, operating margin decreased 6.9 percentage points to 42.6%. Overall, full year EPS declined 17.5% to TWD 32.34 and ROE was 26.2%. On cash flow, we spent USD 30.45 billion or TWD 950 billion in CapEx, while generating TWD 1.7 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD 292 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD 292 billion in cash dividends in 2023.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between USD 18 billion and USD 18.8 billion, which represents a 6.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 31.1, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our fourth quarter '23 and first quarter '24 profitability. Compared to third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin decreased by 130 basis points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to the margin dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to be flat sequentially at 53% at the midpoint, primarily as a less favorable foreign exchange rate assumption. It's offset by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality.
Looking at full year 2024, given the 6 factors that determine our profitability, there are a few puts and takes I would like to share. On the plus side, we expect our utilization rate to rise in 2024 as our business recovers. However, as we move -- as we have said before, N3 is expected to dilute our gross margin by about 3 to 4 percentage points for the full year of 2024 as the revenue contribution will be much higher than in 2023.
In addition, we have a strategy so that some of our N3 capacity can be supported by N5 tools given the strong multiyear demand. Such a plan will enable higher capital efficiency in the mid to long term, but requires cost and effort in the near term. Most of this conversion will occur in second half of 2024, and we expect it to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in second half of 2024.
Finally, we have no control over the foreign exchange rate, but that might be another factor in 2024. Long term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. In 2023, we spent USD 30.4 billion, lower than our prior guidance of approximately USD 32 billion, as we continue to tighten up our capital spending where appropriate given the near-term uncertainties.
In 2024, our capital budget is expected to be between USD 28 billion and USD 32 billion as we continue to invest to support customers' growth. Out of the USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion CapEx for 2024, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for the advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase close to 30% year-over-year in 2024, mainly as we ramp up our 3-nanometer technologies.
Finally, let me make some comments on our long-term CapEx and cash dividend distribution policy. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. In the past few years, we have sharply increased our CapEx spending in preparation to capture or harvest the growth opportunities from HPC, AI and 5G megatrends.
Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is the target we communicated back in January 2022 Investor Conference. With our 2024 CapEx guidance of USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion, the rate of increase of our capital spending has begun to level off as we capture and harvest the growth. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders.
As a result of our rigorous capital management, in November, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the distribution of a TWD 3.5 per share cash dividend for the third quarter of 2023, up from TWD 3 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward. Third quarter '23 cash dividend will be distributed in April 2024.
In 2023, TSMC's shareholders received a total of TWD 11.25 cash dividend per share, and they will receive at least TWD 13.5 per share cash dividend for 2024. In the next few years, we expect the focus of our cash dividend policy to continue to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share. Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2024 outlook. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications with TSMC as a key enabler.
In 2023, weakening global macroeconomic conditions and high inflation and interest rate, it's [ upper ] rate and prolonged the global semiconductor inventory adjustment cycle. Concluding 2023, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory industry, declined about 2%, while foundry industry declined about 13% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue declined 8.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms.
Despite the near-term challenges, our technology leadership enable TSMC to outperform the foundry industry in 2023, while we are positioning us to capture the future AI and high-performance computing-related growth opportunities.
Entering 2024, we forecast fabless semiconductor inventory to have returned to a [ handsome ] level exiting 2023. However, macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties persist, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and the market demand. Having said that, our business has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technologies, strong demand for the 5-nanometer technologies and robust AI-related demand.
Coming off the steep inventory correction and low base of 2023, for the full year of 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase by more than 10% year-over-year, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be approximately 20%. For TSMC, supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we are confident to outperform the foundry industry growth. We expect our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024, and our full year revenue is expected to increase by low to mid-20% in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress. Our 3-nanometer technology are the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. As a result, almost all the world's smartphone and HPC innovators are working with TSMC and 3-nanometer technologies. Our N3 successfully entered volume production and enjoy a strong ramp in second half '23, accounting for 6% of our total wafer revenue in 2023.
N3E further leverage the strong foundation of N3 to extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power and yield. N3E has already entered volume production in the fourth quarter of 2023. Supported by robust demand from customers in both smartphone and HPC applications, we expect revenue from our 3-nanometer technology to more than triple in 2024 and account for a mid-teens percentage of our total wafer revenue.
We also continue to provide further enhancement of our N3 technology, including N3P and the N3X. With our strategy of continuous enhancements of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multiyear demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Now I will talk about the AI-related demand and our N2 status. The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models as the amount of computation required for training and inference  is increasing.
As a result, AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI. To address insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering.
At the same time, as process technology complexity increase, the engagement lead time with customers also started much earlier. Thus, almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC, and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications.
Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a rent profile similar to N3. As part of our N2 technology platform, we also developed the N2 with backside power rail solution, which is better suited for specific HPC applications based on performance, cost and maturity considerations.
N2 with backside power rail will be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our technology of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the AI-related growth opportunities well into the future.
Finally, let me talk about our specialty technology strategies at mature node. For TSMC, today, around 70% of our total revenue is 16-nanometer and more advanced node. With rising contribution from 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer technologies in the next several years, this number will only increase. Thus, our mature node exposure is around 20% of our total revenue.
TSMC's strategy at mature node is to work closely with strategic partner to develop specialty technology solutions to meet customers' requirement and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. Our focus is to build a high yield capacity for specialty technologies rather than just a nominal capacity. Through the development, deployment of the differentiated specialty technologies, the profitability of our mature nodes can be around our corporate average gross margin.
Looking ahead, we forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications, and we expect our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple types of specialty technologies. Thus, we are expanding our 28-nanometer specialty manufacturing capacity overseas to support the long-term structural market demand. We believe demand for the differentiated specialty technology will remain steady despite the potential industry capacity increase and our utilization rate and structural profitability and mature node can be well protected in the future.
This concludes my prepared remarks, and now let me turn the microphone over to Mark. Thank you, C. C. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come.
In today's fractured globalization environment, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase our customer trust, expand our future growth potential and reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government subsidy or support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders.
Firstly, in Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab in Kumamoto, which will utilize 12- and 16-nanometer and 22- and 28-nanometer process technologies. We will hold an opening ceremony for this fab on February 24, next month, and volume production is on track for the fourth quarter of 2024.
In Arizona, we are in close and constant communication with the U.S. government on incentive and a tax credit support and making strong progress in facility supply chain infrastructure, utility supply and equipment installation for our first fab. We continue to work closely and develop strong relationships with our local union and trade partners in Arizona, including recently signed an agreement with Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council on a new framework for cooperation. This agreement extends our collaboration across enhanced workforce training and development, shared commitment to site safety, hiring local workers and establishing regular communication. It is a win-win for all parties.
We are well on track for volume production of N4 or 4-nanometer process technology in first half of '25 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan.
In Europe, we plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications with our joint venture partners. We continue to be in close communication with the German federal, state and city governments and their commitment to this project remain strong and unchanged. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in Q4 2024 this year.
In Taiwan, of course, we continue to invest in and expand our advanced technology capacities to support our customers' needs and their growth. Given the robust multiyear demand for our 3-nanometer technologies, we are expanding our 3-nanometer capacity in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing our N2 volume production starting in 2025. We plan to build multiple fabs or multiple phases of 2-nanometer technologies in both Hsinchu and Kaohsiung science parks to support the strong structural demand from our customer C. C. just mentioned.
In Taichung Science Park, the government approval process is ongoing and is also on track. While the initial cost of overseas fab, I previously mentioned, are higher than TSMC's fab in Taiwan, we are confident to manage and minimize the cost gap and remain committed to deliver profitable growth and maximize the value for our shareholders.
Now let me talk about my retirement. On December 19 last year, I announced that I have decided not to seek nomination of Board members for the next term and will retire from the company after the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting in June. Allow me to say this. Over the past 30 years, I have been incredibly fortunate to be able to work at and contribute to TSMC.
I started at TSMC 30 years ago as a leader of a small 4-person fab construction team. It has been my privilege to serve as Chairman of TSMC and after our legendary founder, Dr. Morris Chang, over the last 6 years. During this time, we have reaffirmed our commitment to our mission, to be the trusted technology and capacity provider to the global logic IC industry for years to come, while adhering to our core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust.
TSMC's success is predicated on providing the industry's most leading-edge process technology at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, to enable all the innovators to successfully offer their best products to the world. We, together, have worked diligently to enhance our focus on our technology leadership, competitiveness, global manufacturing footprint, digital excellence sustainability and corporate governance to maximize the value for our customers and our shareholders.
The past 30 years with TSMC has been an extraordinary journey for me, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to our incredible, talented team and all our TSMC's colleagues, whose diligence, dedication and can-do spirit have made the company into what it is today.
Now TSMC's Nomination, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board has recommended Dr. C. C. Wei to succeed as the company's next Chairman, subject to the election of the incoming Board in June 2024. If Dr. Wei is elected to be Chairman, he should also continue in his current role as CEO, supported by a deep and experienced team of senior executives, many of whom have been with TSMC for many, many years.
As I look ahead to spend more time with my family and starting the next chapter of my life after our AGM in June, I remain fully confident in TSMC's strategy, leadership and execution and firmly believe TSMC will continue to perform outstandingly in the years ahead. Thank you for your trust in TSMC and the best is yet to come for the company and its shareholders.
This conclude my messages and our key messages together. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Chairman. This concludes our prepared statements. [Operator Instructions]  So now let's begin the Q&A session. Again, our Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, will be the host. Let's take the first 2 questions from the floor, please.  Okay. Our first question comes from Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. It's great to see you again in person, Happy New Year. Allow me to remain seated. I have a some long question to you. So first question is to C. C. I am very curious about your comment about the technology leadership, right, because your competitor and also customer, Intel, states that their PPA is ahead of your 2-nanometer, even the cost is lower.
So I want to consult your opinion why there's a different story and how do we charge? And given this debate, how TSMC is going to plan the future capacity for this customer and also competitor? We want to seize this opportunity, but also avoid any overexpansion. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. Just please allow me for the benefit of the audience here in person and online to summarize your question. So Charlie's first question is around sort of the technology leadership and also our relationship, I guess, our capacity planning with a specific IDM.
So the first part of his question is on the technology part. He notes this IDM says their PPA is ahead of TSMC's 2-nanometer and the costs can be lower, yet we said our technology is industry leading, so how do we reconcile the difference? And also, how do we plan the future capacity planning for such type of customer? Charlie, you named my customer's name. That's my customer and my competitor. Let me repeat the last time when I comment on their technology. The comment stays the same, so that their new technology will be very similar or equivalent to TSMC's N3P. We further checked again with all the specs, all the possible published in the technology, transistor technology and everything. My comment stays the same.
With a big advantage in the technology maturity, because of in 2025, when they say that their new technology will go on production, for TSMC, that will be the third year with a very high volume production in the fabs. So again, I don't want to make too much of a comment on my customers' claim. But let me assure you, we continue to have a technology leadership and we continue to have a broad base of customer. And almost everybody, almost, they are working with TSMC, okay? In that case, would you aggressively spend capacity because outsourcing is more likely? Certainly, we expand our capacity with USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion, that's a big money. That will be used for 3 nanometer and 2 nanometers of capacity. Let me add some color to this, C. C. I think C. C. has been very modest. I think he's claimed that our N3P is comparable to their 18A. We still affirm our statement. But I would like you to look at a different perspective. And what C. C. -- what the other side claim might be right, but it's only to their own product. And IDM typically optimize their technology for their own product, where foundry, us, we optimize our technology for our customers' product, so that's a big difference.
What you use for the high-power server could be very different than what is used with these gadgets on your hands, smartphone or even the large edge AI processors, so you should look at this. I think the time -- compared with PPA, we still affirm our statement. But I think just look at our customers' action, that just tell this -- all the stories. So Jeff, can I go for a second one? Yes. So Mark, so first of all, I really appreciate your leadership. I believe the global investors appreciate your past 6 years, create lots of shareholders' value. So my question is about the content of your speech in November. The speech was about the TSMC in the era for AI. And you mentioned some very interesting data points. You use the AI technology to improve the defense [ cloudification ].
Also, the EUV throughput by, for example, 10%, right? So now it's -- the generative AI can be very big breakthrough in terms of technology. Do you think Samsung or Intel, by leveraging the generative AI, can really break through and catch up your technology? And also before your retirement, any kind of a big unfinished goal or targets for TSMC? Okay. Thank you, Charlie. So Charlie's second question is directed to Chairman. He noted in November, Chairman gave a speech where he shared how TSMC has always been utilizing big data, machine learning and AI to improve our operational efficiencies. His question is whether now with generative AI, will this enable or allow our competitors to do the same thing and catch up and narrow the gap. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. The talk I gave in last November was -- the audience is the Taiwan's industry, companies. The purpose I want to give that is I see artificial intelligence can be a great opportunity for the industry in Taiwan. Just like Taiwan is a big country for semiconductor, it can be a big country for artificial intelligence in the future. That's how I encouraged them.
And as far as the -- whether our competitor are using AI, of course, of course, they use AI. And just look at all the company -- AI company in Silicon Valley or in U.S. That's not a secret. But on the other hand, AI is only in its nascent stage. Only last November, the first large language data is announced, ChatGPT announced.
We only see the tip of the iceberg. So I want to give the industry an optimistic note that even though 1 nanometer or sub 1 nanometer could be challenging, but we have a new technology capability using AI to accelerate the innovation in science. And that is the -- that is our part, and we have been working on that for many years already.
So we opened -- of course, it's a fair competition. It's no secret. You have another question about one. Well, I still have -- yes, indeed, I will retire in June. And from now to June is a long time. And the company, a lot of thinking happened. And I think -- I hope we definitely execute to C. C.'s forecast of this year. I think by the middle of this year, I think we're pretty sure we can accomplish that.
And of course, C.C. just mentioned, our technology development is on the slew of success. And by June this year, we will know what we are going to fare in 2025. And I give our executive a milestone. I don't want to share with you, but it's going to be very exciting for TSMC.
And of course, from now on, I simply want to encourage our people in TSMC that the world has changed. Just like you mentioned, we have to use artificial intelligence for future technology. So we will go into global -- we try our global footprint, and we are trying our digital excellence. By digital excellence, you mean we can't count on the hardworking of Taiwan engineer. Only we have to recreate our job to tap their talents and lift up the semiconductor technology engineering to a different level based on what we already have.
And of course, the corporate governance is one thing I always see in my heart. During this transition, I want every executive and our Board to adhere to the sound corporate governance so that make sure all the process steps is abided by our ethical governance rules. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Let's take the -- move on to the second person from the floor. I think in front, Bruce Lu of Goldman Sachs, please. Again, the question is definitely coming from the AI, for sure. I think, as C. C. mentioned, almost every AI chip is working with TSMC. However, the investors' concern is always like the dollar content, as a percentage of customers' cost for AI is a lot lower than smartphone or other chips. So as also C. C. mentioned, that you sell a wafer for your customer, but when you buy it back, it's a lot more expensive.
So can we expect that the dollar generated by TSMC from AI can be increased in the coming years, whether it's through, like, node migration or advanced packaging or anything we can expect or what kind of rate we can expect for that? Okay. Let me summarize Bruce's first question. I think, again, he is around AI related. He notes that basically, almost all the innovators are working with TSMC at AI, but the value per chip that we seem to be capturing is lower than for a smartphone or PC. So his question is that I think can we expect the dollar value captured by TSMC to increase in the next few years? And will this be -- this additional value more come from the front-end process node wafer production? Or will it be through the advanced packaging solutions? Well, let me answer the easiest one first. The revenue come from the front end and back end together. Okay. To capture the value, yes, we are working on it, definitely. But first, let me say that I'm very happy that my customer has been very successful in the AI area, and we are a key enabler for the AI applications.
So far today, everything you saw on the AI came from TSMC, okay? Now here comes the question is that how are we going to capture the value. We are working on it. And actually, we see today, this is at the component total value in the AI. The whole AI data center is a very small percentage a month. If we narrow down the AI's component or the semiconductors' value in the whole system, yes, it's a small percentage.
But for TSMC, we look at ours here, the AI's a CAGR, that's the growth rate every year, it's about 50%. And we are confident that we can capture more opportunities in the future. So that's what we said that up to 2027, we are going to have high teens of the revenue from a very narrow, we defined the AI application process, not to mention about the networking, not to mention about all others, okay?
And to further extend our value, actually, all the edge device, including smartphone, including the PC, they start to put the AI's application inside. They have some kind of a neural process, for example, so the silicon content will be greatly increased. Although the unit is actually low single digit in CAGR, but the silicon content is more important. So put all together, if we lumpsum all the AI-related application, actually, it's quite a big amount for TSMC to grow. Okay. Bruce, do you have a second question, please. Yes. The second question is more for the technology leadership. I mean, as we move into the nanosheet or advanced node, we see another technology divide nowadays. For example, like a high-NA EUV tools. TSMC seems has a different view with other peers. I mean, in the past, like, 20, 30 years, there are several technology divide  that TSMC always choose the right decisions, right? So can you tell us about why you choose your current route comparing to your peers? What is the pros and cons? And what's the advantage? And how confident that TSMC can leverage that to be the key success factor for the leading edge? Okay. Bruce's second question is in regards, I think, to technology development and decision-making basically. He notices that today, there's divergence or his words, divide between different companies technology decision, whether to adopt nanosheet transistor structure, whether to adopt high NA tools. He notes that in the past, that this is always occurred in our industry, but TSMC has somehow managed to make the right decision.
So he is asking, especially how -- what do we look at or evaluate in our decision-making process, what are the pros and cons and advantages, and probably most importantly, how confident are we about our technology decisions going forward, whether nanosheet, high NA given our competitors' actions? Bruce, you asked a very technical question. I'm not very sure everybody knows the high NA or is the nanosheet or gate all around. But let me answer the question. We always make the right decision, and our track record shows that. Is that enough?
Okay. Let me elaborate a little bit more. Because of technology itself is no value. Only what that can serve your customer. So we always work with our customers to give them the best transistor technology and the best power-efficient technology and at a reasonable cost, okay? And more importantly, the technology maturity that -- in the high-volume production, that's all important.
Everything. Everything counted together. So we -- every time we know that there are some new structure, new tools such as high-NA EUV, we look at it carefully, look at the maturity of the tools, look at the cost of the tools and look at the schedule of that -- how to achieve it. We always make the right decision at the right moment to serve our customer.
And so far, all our customers are happy with TSMC's progress, okay? Did that answer your question. Almost everybody worked with TSMC on 2-nanometer, except 1. Okay. Thank you, C. C. All right. Let's go to the online, take the next 2 questions from the participants who are dialing in via the conference call, please. Operator, could you please state the name and company? The first person to ask a question from the line is Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Yes. [indiscernible] Okay. Gokul, okay, I need you to slow down a little bit because the line is not that clear. I do think I got his question, which is he wants to confirm, C. C., you mentioned that we have a very narrow definition, we call server AI processor contribution and that you said it can be high teens in 5 years' time because the last time, we said low teens. The demand suddenly being increased since last -- I think, last year, the first quarter up to March or April, when ChatGPT become popular, so customers respond quickly and asked TSMC to prepare the capacity, both in front end and the back end. And that's why we have confidence that this AI's revenue will increase.
We only narrowed down to the AI application process, by the way. So we look at ours here, that we prepare the technology and the capacities in both our front end and also back end. And so we -- it's in the early stage so far today. We already see the increase, the momentum. And we expect -- if you guys continue to track this one, the number will increase. I have confidence to say that, although I don't know how much. So high teens, you confirm? Or higher. Yes. Okay. So okay, Gokul, hopefully, that clarifies that first question. The second is about gross margin. In the downturn, we are forming out at much higher gross margin levels than before. Talk a little bit about what happens when we get back to close to full utilization. So I think we are still running at well below full utilization in 2023. And could you also explain the gross margin dilution that you're expecting in second half '23 because of this capacity conversion? What exactly leads to that gross margin dilution? And is that like a onetime kind of dilution that lasts for a little bit of time and kind of levels off in 2025? Okay. Thank you, Gokul. So if I heard correctly, Gokul's second question is around gross margin. So 2 parts to it. Maybe the second part first, which is he is asking, I believe, about this gross margin in the second half of this year, particularly with what Wendell had described. They are planning to convert some of the capacity, the gross margin impact here, and is this a onetime thing? Is this better capital -- what does this mean in the mid- to long-term profitability? That's the first part. And then I'll go to the second one. Right. Second half, the -- as I said, there are 2 negative factors affecting our gross margin this year. The first one is the N3 dilution. N3 volume will be much bigger in the second half than the first half. So the second half impact from N3 dilution will be between 3 to 4 percentage points.
And also the N5 capacity converted to N3. That will mostly take place in the second half as well. So that will be 1 to 2 percentage points, okay? That's for this year. For the longer term, if you look at these 2 factors, our N3 dilution will gradually reduce, because the profitability will continue to improve or increase in the next several years.
And N5 converted to N3, it's a onetime short-term impact on profitability, which will bring capital efficiency to us in the middle to long term. And the benefits together will be much bigger than the onetime hit in the short term. So if you're talking about the longer-term profitability, including these 2 factors, plus we're selling our value, our technology value, as C. C. mentioned, we continue to drive down the cost.
We build our capacity based on the long-term market profile and not the short-term cyclicality and therefore, enable us to have a pretty good utilization. The only thing we are not able to control is foreign exchange rate. So if you put all these together, we still believe that 53% and higher long-term gross margin is achievable. Okay. Gokul, does that answer both parts of your question? Yes. So just to clarify, so given we are much -- at a much lower utilization than normal, what you suggests, Wendell, is that gross margin should get back to the mid- to high 50s once the up cycle starts to gain more momentum, just like what we saw in 2022. Is that a reasonable expectation? Yes. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. So Gokul, really, he's asking 53% and higher. Can it be higher? Because, of course, he looks at last year, the utilization was lower, and we still managed to deliver. So he's wondering once utilization goes back to full, can it get to mid- to high 50s? We are working on it. Okay. Certainly, we prepare our capacity according to customers' demand. Last year is very challenging because everybody missed their forecast and so did TSMC. And so the utilization rate is pretty bad. And I believe everybody got more experience in the next few years. And so TSMC's utilization rate will continue to increase, I guarantee that. So the question is we're working on that. It can be. Okay. Thank you, Gokul. Thank you. Operator, let's move on to the -- take the question from the second participant on the call. The second one to ask a question is Randy Abrams from UBS. Okay. Yes. And good luck to both Mark and C. C. as you go through the upcoming transition. I wanted to ask, going back to the question on the IDM. I think, earlier, you conceded that your competitor's process is actually pretty good for -- optimized to their own products. Could you talk about your view on sustainability of the ramp of that IDM outsourcing with your own products in HPC? If you look out over the next 2 to 3 years, if you see that continuing to grow or reversed, or there could be a bit of a cooling off from some of the opportunity you have right in front of you now? Okay. Thank you, Randy. So Randy's first question goes back to the IDM. His question is, with the IDM saying their technology is pretty good, what is the risk? Or how do we see the sustainability of this IDM's outsourcing business to TSMC in the next 2 to 3 years? Can this continue to grow? Or will this reverse and go back in-house to the IDM? And how do we manage or plan for this? Okay. Randy, that's a good question. Actually, we have taken into account all the considerations, including the IDM, can do it by himself. We have put that one into consideration, actually, in our capacity planning. Actually, we took a very conservative way to prepare our capacity in this kind of a situation. Okay. I cannot speak more because of that's our strategy. Okay. If I can ask a follow-up, actually, just through the CapEx, where I think, earlier, you said the rate of increase would slow down. But I think still implying it should increase over time as you grow. If you could discuss -- the CapEx that you guided was flat. Should we think of it as a pause whereas you start to move into 2-nanometer, there should be another wave of increase?
And second part, somewhat related, but curious about the geographic expansion. There's been a lot of press about new fabs in Japan, second fab and potential third advanced fabs. And it feels like the first fab went smoothly. So are you starting to redirect or think more expansion to Japan rather than U.S.? Or potentially both, you have both options as you move to 3-nanometer? Okay, Randy. That's a lot of questions. So I'm going to take that as your second question, okay, basically. So the first part of it is about the CapEx. He notes that Wendell said the rate of increase is beginning to level off. Randy's question is for this year and take the midpoint, $30 billion is basically flat. So is this just a temporary pause in the CapEx? And with 2-nanometer in the upcoming years, should we expect the dollar amount to go back up? That's the first part. Okay, Randy, the CapEx dollar amount, every year, may vary. It depends on the different situation. The rate of increase definitely is slower than the past 3 years. And if you look at -- I think the other way of looking at that is the capital intensity. In the past 3 years, the highest point is 2021. So it's going to be -- it was over 50% and then followed by 47% and 43%. And this year, if you do the math, is going to be mid-30s. We expect, in the next several years, it will remain around the 30 percentage capital intensity. Okay. And then the other part of Randy's question is on the geographic expansion. He notes a lot of reports saying we may build a second fab in Japan and that we even may build a third. So his question is really, are we redirecting our overseas expansion focus more to Japan? Or has it changed anything in the U.S.? Randy, I think that's what you're trying to ask, right? Yes, that's what I'm trying to ask. Can you repeat the question again? Sure. So Randy is saying, look, he knows there's a lot of talk, we're going to build a second fab in Japan, maybe 3. So he just wants to know, are we shifting our overseas expansion focus to Japan or -- from the U.S.? Or is there any big significant change? No, no. I think you -- Japan, the second fab in Japan is in serious evaluation stage. We haven't announced to the public yet. And we're still discussing with the Japan government. Although many -- they are very cooperative, so we might be waiting for that.  But that technology will still be either 7 or 16, 12 technologies. And remember the -- our Kaohsiung fab, the first fab used to be 28-nanometer or 7-nanometer. Now it's becoming 2-nanometer. So that is the shift to -- for the -- if there is a second fab in Japan, that's our current plan. And as far as the... That's helpful. And for -- and to quickly talk 3-nanometer because 5-nanometer was slightly delayed, would 3-nanometer still come 2 years after the new plan for 5 in Arizona? So in Arizona, Randy wants to know that we have 5-nanometer in first half '25. What's the plan for the second fab with 3-nanometer? Yes, we are -- the second fab shell is under construction. But what technology in that shell is still under discussion, and I think that also has to do with how much incentives that fab -- the U.S. government can provide. And yes, there will be a gap, at least current planning is '27 or '28, yes. That will be the timeframe.
To be honest, mostly -- most all the fab in overseas, what's actually being loaded, what technology being set up, really, it's a decision of customers' demand in that area at that timing, so nothing is definitive. But we are trying to optimize the value for the overseas fab for TSMC. Okay. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Randy. All right. In the interest of time, we'll take the next 2 from the floor. I think there's one here. First, Laura Chen from Citi Bank. I think we got a lot of discussion about the leading position in the most advanced nodes. So I just have a question about what's your view on the mature node dynamic? And particularly, we are seeing that globally, consider the geopolitical tension. So we are seeing that the fab, all over the place in the world, so do you see that in the longer term, any concern on industry-wise overcapacity? So what's TSMC's strategy? And also, what's your view on your mature node profitability as well? That's my first part. Okay. Thank you, Laura. So Laura's first question is on mature node strategy and profitability. She notes, with the geopolitical dynamics, that there's a lot of capacity being built on the mature nodes. So her question is do we see or expect an industry-wide oversupply, and probably more importantly, what is the impact to TSMC's mature node strategy and profitability? Laura, I think your observation is right. There might be too much of a capacity being built right now for mature nodes. So the concern on overcapacity is valid. Now let's talk about the TSMC. As I said, the TSMC increased the mature node capacity for specialty technology, differentiated with others. We work with customers and that kind of capacity, actually, effective capacity as we name it, is with a commitment from customers loading and for the future business.
And because we offer the value for our customer to design their product, so we believe that they can retain their product's value even the capacity is [ broadened ] in the industry. And so long as our customer is doing well, TSMC is doing well. And so the profitability, as I said in my statement, it will be around the corporate average, so we don't have concern. We speak for TSMC, okay? It could be industry issues. That's very helpful. And also my second question is back to AI related. As we know that a lot of investors care a lot about your advanced packaging progress. We also know that TSMC got a very good progress on DDIC SoIC, so can you share with us your progress development beyond CoWos, what's your plan on the DDIC and what's the schedule and the capacity you are aiming for in the next 2, 3 years? Okay. Thank you, Laura. So Laura, second question is on advanced packaging. She notes again the strong demand for AI-related applications. So advanced packaging, the progress. Of course, CoWos, demand is very strong. Her question is, really, I think, beyond CoWos, into true 3D IC or integration solutions, such as SoIC. What is the progress that we see the engagement from customers, the capacity and basically the outlook for these segments of the business? The demand actually is very strong. Today's situation, that we cannot offer enough capacity to support our customer, and that condition will continue probably all the way to next year, although we are very -- working very hard to increase the capacity. For example, this year, we are doubling our output,  still not enough. And so we continue to increase for the next year.
The progress, so far so good because we invested on the advanced packaging technology for more than 10 years, already. So we expect the growth rate for CoWoS for 3D IC or for SoIC per se, it will be more than 50% CAGR in the next few years, at least. And so we are confident that the demand is there. It's TSMC's capability to offer enough capacity to support our customers. For CoWoS, you will be doubling. And what's the idea about the next year? Do you have any preliminary thought? I will talk to you next year. Okay. Thank you. We have a question here from Brad Lin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I think in the interest of time, we'll take 1 question. Sorry, from yourself, and then we'll take 1 more from the line and then 1 more in person if there's any. Well, so my question will be still around N3 and also IDM. So as we understand, the demand is uncertain, but we can definitely increase our business certainty by gaining market share. So do we expect some more contribution or market share gain, especially from IDM side? Or any more contribution from PC side, maybe, well, by the end of the year or any time soon? Okay. So Brad's first question is about IDM outsourcing, I think, again, given the technology leadership that we have, he wants to know, do we expect more business or outsourcing from the IDM by the end of this year? Or -- and how do we see it? Is it uncertain going forward? That is too specific. You say that IDM outsourcing, I know whom you talk about. So I better not to make any comment. I still -- what I said, we take everything into consideration. We welcome the business, but we prepared our capacity expansion, okay? Your second question? Yes. So it's on the advanced packaging. So we know that the CoWoS, as right now, it's the mainstream. So have the management seen the clients converting to either CoWoS-R or CoWoS-L? And then what's the implication to revenue and margin profile? Okay. So it's also a very specific, too specific question. But again, Brad wants to know, CoWoS-S seems to be the mainstream today. Do you see customers switching to CoWoS-L or CoWoS-R? And what's the margin implication? Well, let's make a joke. I even didn't know what is CoWoS-R or CoWoS-L. But anyway, we are working with customers to support them with adequate capacity, although it's not 100% enough, but we do our best. And we're developing that next-generation CoWoS-L or something like that for our customer. And it's our [ priority ] that it's welcomed by all my customers, so we are preparing the capacity for it. Got it. Last one, not the least, not a question. That's 2 questions, so… No, no, not a question. So basically, well, I want to say, well, thank you, Mark, for your leadership, contribution, endeavor for the past 30 years, not just for Taiwan -- not just for TSMC, but also for Taiwan. And I wish you a happy retirement and also the new chapter of life. Okay. We will take the final questions from the last 2 participants. Let's go online first, then we have 1 in final in person, okay? Operator? Next from the call is Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. I have 2 of them. First one, I think, Wendell, you spoke about revenue growth for the year and again from gross margin guidance. I'm just kind of wondering how do you think about gross margin for the full year in the context of the fact that TSMC's revenue is going to grow in the low to mid-20%. How do you think about gross margin for full year 2024? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. Krish, again, sorry, we could not hear you clearly online. But I think his question is, correct me if I'm wrong, with the revenue outlook that we gave, low to mid-20s growth in U.S. dollar term, what is the outlook for the full year gross margin? Is that what you're asking? That's correct. Yes. Okay. That's right, Jeff. Yes. Right. So I just mentioned a couple of puts and takes on the gross margin of this year. And I also said that the second half, we will have a higher dilution from 2 factors. But we're not ready to give out a full year guidance on gross margin yet. So we'll talk about that as time goes by. But let me say this, longer term, with all the factors together, still 53% and higher is definitely, we're very confident in achieve that. Okay. Does that -- yes. Sorry, Krish, why don't you go ahead? I have a follow-up. Yes, just a quick follow-up. And I also just want to say thanks a lot, Mark, for all the support. Just a follow-up. In terms of the revenue growth for this year, December quarter, you exited HPC and smartphone roughly 43% of revenue. What's going to drive the growth this year? Is it HPC? Or smartphone? Which is going to be better this year to get to the low to mid-20%? Okay. Krish, sorry. Again, we could not hear you that clearly, but I think I got the gist of your question. Maybe the way Krish -- his question is what the components that's driving the revenue growth this year. Maybe we can share with him by the 4 growth platforms. Krish, the HPC will be -- will have the highest growth, actually much higher than the corporate. The other 3 platforms will all grow, although slower than the corporate. Okay. Then we'll take the final question from the floor, the first row here. Nicolas Baratte of Macquarie. Very quick question. Is it possible or would you expect that some of your Arizona customers could be only customers in Arizona? That some U.S. customers only want to buy wafers made in the U.S.? Sorry, your question is, will customers in Arizona only be U.S. customers? Is it possible some U.S. customers only want U.S.-made wafers? Why don't we answer that question. Arizona fab is for everybody, but majority is a U.S. customer, you are right. Do you have another question? No? Okay. Well, if not, then this does conclude our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 30 minutes from now, and the transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which are going to be available through our website, TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay well, and we hope you will see -- join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a great day. Thanks.","TSMC's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference and conference call will be webcast live . the format for today's event will be as follows: tsmc.com's vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, followed by our guidance for the first quarter 2024 . fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% sequentially in NT dollar or 13.6% in U.S. dollars .",1.0

TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials shortly. [Operator Instructions]
The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Senior Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2024, followed by our guidance for the second quarter 2024. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C. C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the lines for the question-and-answer session.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears on our press release.
And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2024.
First quarter revenue decreased 5.3% sequentially in NT dollars or 3.8% in U.S. dollars as our business was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Gross margin increased 0.1 percentage point sequentially to 53.1%, mainly reflecting product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange rate.
Total operating expenses accounted for 11.1% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance, mainly due to tighter expense controls. Thus, operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 42%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 8.7 and ROE was 25.4%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 9% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, whilst 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 19%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 65% of wafer revenue.
Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 46% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 16% to account for 38%. IoT increased 5% to account for 6%. Automotive remained flat and accounted for 6%, and DCE increased 33% to account for 2%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.9 trillion or USD 60 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 113 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 140 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 44 billion in accounts payable. The increase in accrued liabilities and others was mainly due to the reclassification of the temporary receipt from customers from long-term liabilities.
Our financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 31 days, while days of inventory increased 5 days to 90 days, primarily due to ramp of 3-nanometer technologies.
Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 436 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 181 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 78 billion for second quarter 2023 cash dividend. In addition, we raised TWD 23 billion in cash from bond issuances.
Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 233 billion to TWD 1.7 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $5.77 billion.
I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality.
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase and 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.3, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 40% and 42%.
Also, in the second quarter, we will need to accrue the tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be slightly above 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 13% to 14% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 15% to 16% compared to 14.5% in 2023. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on the impact from the April 3 earthquake. On April 3, an earthquake of 7.2 magnitude struck Taiwan, and the maximum magnitude of our fabs was 5. Safety systems and protocols at our fabs were initiated immediately, and all TSMC personnel are safe.
Based on TSMC's deep experience and capabilities in earthquake response and damage prevention as well as regular disasters drills, the overall tool recovery in our fabs reached more than 70% within the first 10 hours and were fully recovered by the end of the third day. There were no power outages, no structural damage to our fabs, and there's no damage to our critical tools, including all of our EUV lithography tools.
That being said, a certain number of wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, but we expect most of the lost production to be recovered in the second quarter and, thus, minimum impact to our second quarter revenue. We expect the total impact from the earthquake to reduce our second quarter gross margin by about 50 basis points, mainly due to the losses associated with wafer scraps and material loss. 
Next, let me talk about our first quarter '24 and second quarter '24 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter 2023, our first quarter gross margin slightly increased by 10 basis points sequentially to 53.1%, primarily driven by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to the impact from the earthquake on April 3, as just discussed, and higher electricity cost in Taiwan.
After last year's 17% electricity price increase from April 1, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 25% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 70 to 80 basis points from our second quarter gross margin. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the impact from higher electricity cost to continue and dilute our gross margin by 60 to 70 basis points. We also expect the higher electricity cost to indirectly lead to higher materials, chemical and gases and other variable costs.
In addition, we expect our overall business in the second quarter of the year to be stronger than the first half. And the revenue contribution from 3-nanometer technologies is expected to increase as well, which will dilute our gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in second half of '24 as compared to 2 to 3 percentage points in first half of '24. 
Finally, as we have said before, we have a strategy to convert some 5-nanometer tools to support 3-nanometer capacity given the strong multiyear demand. We expect this conversion to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024. 
To manage our profitability in second half 2024, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Longer term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Okay. Sorry to interrupt, Wendell, because we have been informed that some of the audience are having difficulty linking through the website to the call. So let's pause a few minutes, and we'll continue once we resolve the IT issue. Thank you, everyone, for your patience.
[Technical Difficulty]
[ Audience ] on the telephone call, sorry, we're having a little bit of IT issue. We should expect hopefully to resolve it very soon. So just please hang on for a few more minutes, and thank you for your patience.  
Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your patience. Sorry about the technical issues. We believe the webcast, if you're through the TSMC website, you should be able to log back in and listen to the webcast. For those of you on the line or having difficulty with the telephone, I think try the webcast first and the telephone line should be available shortly. Again, sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for the patience. 
In light of the fact that we had these technical issues, I think we'll start with Wendell Huang, our CFO, to give our guidance, and then we will go into our prepared remarks. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. Sorry, everyone.
Let me repeat the guidance for second quarter again. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality.
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase or a 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.3, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. 
Also, in the second quarter, we will need to accrue the tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be slightly above 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 13% to 14% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 15% to 16% compared to 14.5% in 2023. 
Now that concludes the financial presentation. Let me now repeat our key messages. I will start by making some comments on the impact from the April 3 earthquake. On April 3, an earthquake of 7.2 magnitude struck Taiwan, and the maximum magnitude at our fabs was 5. Safety systems and protocols at our fabs were initiated immediately, and all TSMC personnel are safe.

There were no power shortages, no structure damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our EUV lithography tools.
That being said, a certain number of wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, but we expect most of the lost production to be recovered in the second quarter and, thus, minimal impact to our second quarter revenue. We expect the total impact from the earthquake to reduce our second quarter gross margin by about 50 basis points, mainly due to the losses associated with wafer scraps and material loss. 
Next, let me talk about our first quarter 2024 and second quarter 2024 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter of 2023, our first quarter gross margin slightly increased by 10 basis points sequentially to 53.1%, primarily driven by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to impact from the earthquake on April 3, as just discussed, and higher electricity costs in Taiwan. 
After last year's 17% electricity price increase from April 1, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan was -- has increased by another 25% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 70 to 80 basis points from our second quarter gross margin. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the impact from higher electricity costs continue and dilute our gross margin by 60 to 70 basis points. We also expect the higher electricity cost to indirectly lead to higher materials, chemicals and gases and other variable costs. 
In addition, we expect our overall business in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half. And revenue contribution from 3-nanometer technologies is expected to increase as well, which will dilute our gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in second half '24 as compared to 2 to 3 percentage points in first half of '24. 
Finally, as we have said before, we have a strategy to convert some 5-nanometer tools to support 3-nanometer capacity given the strong multiyear demand. We expect this conversion to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024. 
To manage our profitability in second half of '24, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Longer term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. 
Finally, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Our CapEx and capacity planning is always based on long-term market demand profile. We reiterate our 2024 capital budget is expected to be between USD 28 billion and USD 32 billion as we continue to invest to support customers' growth.
Out of the USD 28 billion to USD 32 billion CapEx for 2024, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making and others. 
Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I would like to take a moment and make a few remarks.
On April 3, TSMC experienced a major-scale earthquake of 7.2 magnitude. Our deepest sympathies and heart go out to all those who are affected by this tragedy. I also want to recognize and deeply thank all of our employees and our suppliers for their dedication and hard effort during this time.
Although it was largest earthquake in Taiwan in the last 25 years, we worked together tirelessly and were able to resume for operation at all our fab within 3 days with minimal disruptions, demonstrating the resilience of our operation in Taiwan.
Lastly, I would also like to extend our great appreciation to our customers with their understanding and support as we work to recover the lost production during the second quarter. 
Now let me start my prepared remarks with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 18.9 billion, slightly above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the first quarter was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. 
Moving into second quarter 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality.
Looking at the full year 2024, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand. We thus expect the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to experience a more mild and gradual recovery in 2024.
We lowered our forecast for the 2024 overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase by approximately 10% year-over-year, while foundry industry growth is now forecast to be mid- to high-teens percent, both are coming off the steep inventory correction and/or base of 2023. Having said that, we continue to expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC. 
Supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we expect that our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024 and reaffirm our full year revenue to increase by low to mid-20% in U.S. dollar terms. 
Next, I will talk about the strong AI-related demand outlook. The continued surge in AI-related demand supports our already strong conviction that structural demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications.
AI technology is evolving to use ever increasingly complex AI models, which needs to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware. No matter which approach is taken, it requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of our technology position is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technology at scale with a   dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. 
In summary, our technology leadership enable TSMC to win business and enables our customer to win business in their end market. Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power. We forecast the revenue contribution from several AI processors to more than double this year and account for low-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024.
For the next 5 years, we forecast it to grow at 50% CAGR and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028. Several AI processors are narrowly defined as GPUs, AI accelerators and CPU's performing, training and inference functions and do not include the networking edge or on-device AI. We expect several AI processors to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 
Now let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global IC -- logic IC industry for years to come. Given the strong HPC and AI-related demand, it is strategically important for TSMC to expand our global manufacturing footprint to continue to support our U.S. customers' growth, increase customers' trust and expand our future growth potential. 
In Arizona, we have received the strong commitment and support from our U.S. customers and plan to build 3 fabs, which help to create greater economies of scale. Each of our fab in Arizona will have a clean-room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logical fab. We have made significant progress in our first fab, which has already entered engineering wafer production in April with the N4 process technology. We are well on track for volume production in first half 2025. 
Our second fab has been upgraded to utilize 2-nanometer technologies to support a strong AI-related demand in addition to the previously announced 3-nanometer. We recently completed the [ tapping off ], in which the last steel construction beam was raised into place, and volume production is scheduled to begin in 2028. 
We also recently announced plans to build a third fab in Arizona using 2-nanometer or more advanced technologies, with production beginning by the end of the decade. We are confident that once we begin volume production, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in each of our fab in Arizona as from our fab in Taiwan. 
In Japan, we held an opening ceremony in February in Kumamoto for our first specialty technology fab. This fab will utilize the 12/16 and the 22/28-nanometer process technologies and is on track for volume production in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Together with our JV partners, we also announced a plan to build a second specialty fab in Japan with 40, 12/16 and the 6/7-nanometer process technologies to support a strategic customer for consumer, automotive, industrial and HPC-related applications. Construction is scheduled to begin in second half '24 with production target by the end 2027. 
In Europe, we plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications with our JV partners where construction is scheduled to begin in fourth quarter this year. Our overseas decision are based on our customers' need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders.
In today's fragmented globalization environment, cost will be higher of everyone, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors and the entire semiconductor industry. We plan to manage and minimize the overseas cost gap by, first, pricing strategically to reflect the value of geographic flexibility; second, working closely with government to secure their support; and third, leveraging our fundamental advantage of manufacturing technology leadership and our large-scale manufacturing base, which no other manufacturer in this industry can match.
Thus, even after factoring in the higher cost of overseas fab, we are confident to deliver a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25% that we have committed to our shareholders. At the same time, TSMC will be the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer in the region that we operate. We are continuing to provide our customers with the most advanced technology at scale to support their growth. 
Finally, I will talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology leads our industry in addressing the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing, and almost all AI innovators are working with TSMC. We are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement at N2 and expect the number of the new tape-outs from 2-nanometer technology in its first 2 years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years. 
Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the nanosheet transistors structure and be the most advanced semiconductor industry technology in both density and energy efficiency. N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivative will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the AI-related growth opportunities well into future.
This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention. Okay. Thank you, C. C. This concludes our prepared remarks. Again, thank you, everyone, for your patience. [Operator Instructions] Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our management answers your question. [Operator Instructions] So now let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, can we please proceed with the first caller on the line? Thank you. The first one to ask questions is Gokul Hariharan, JPMorgan. My first questions are on demand. So C. C., you kind of reduced the expectation for the overall semiconductor industry growth. Could you talk a little bit about where is the area where you have seen that slower pickup in demand? I think you talked about smartphone a couple of times in the call. Is it primarily the smartphone area where you've seen a slower pickup in terms of demand? 
And previously, a couple of quarters back, you talked about cannibalization or decline in regular data center demand due to the crowding out of AI and being a drag for TSMC. Do you see that the regular compute, regular data center networking kind of demand is coming back? Or is it still remaining muted and most of the demand uptick is still focused on AI? Okay. So Gokul, thank you. So Gokul's first question is a little bit 2 parts. So he notes that we have lowered our overall semiconductor ex memory growth forecast for this year to approximately 10% and foundry now to mid to high teens. So Gokul wants to understand, in what segments or applications or areas are we seeing a slower pickup in demand? And then also, in terms of specifically AI versus traditional servers, how are you seeing that demand shape out? And what is the impact to TSMC? Is that generally correct, Gokul? Yes. And I think maybe since you called out smartphone, just maybe mention how you see the smartphone demand compared to maybe 3 months back as well. Well, Gokul, this is C. C. Wei. Let me answer your questions and some of your comment also. Yes, smartphone end-market demand is seeing gradual recovery and not a steep recovery, of course. PC has been bottomed out and the recovery is slower. However, AI-related data center demand is very, very strong. And the traditional server demand is slow, lukewarm. IoT and consumer remain sluggish. Automotive inventory continue to correct, okay?
What does that mean to TSMC? The budget for a hyperscale player, their wallet share shifted from traditional server to AI server is favorable for TSMC. And we are able to capture most of the semiconductor content in an AI server's area as we define the GPU, [ edge AI ] networking processor, et cetera. Well, we have a lower presence in those CPU-only, CPU-centric traditional server. So we expect our growth will be very healthy. Do I answer your question, Gokul? Okay. So yes, I just wanted to ask, is it smartphone the main change compared to, let's say, back in January when you had more than 10% growth for semi? Or is it across the board you're seeing a slower recovery? So Gokul is asking sort of versus 3 months ago, where have we seen the major shift in the overall end market? Is there a particular area that we have seen? Yes, Gokul, 3 months ago, we project that one of the platforms, the automotive platform was -- will increase this year, but now we're expecting it to decrease. So I think that is the one area that we saw was different. Okay. My second question, just wanted to understand gross margin trends. We talked about 3 to 4 percentage point gross margin dilution from N3 ramp in second half of the year. Should we think that the N3-related gross margin drag is more severe than usual for what we have seen for leading-edge nodes in the past? Or is it largely similar to what we have seen in N5 or N7?
And when we go to N2, do you think that this will kind of be the similar pattern? Or do you think that the gross margin dilution will be lower when we go to like future process nodes given that N3 seems to be, at least compared to previous cycle, seems to be dragging a little bit more compared to like N5 or N7 in the past few years? Okay. Thank you, Gokul. So let me summarize your second question, basically, is on gross margin. Gokul notes that N3, as Wendell said, will dilute our margin by 3 to 4 points, percentage points in the second half. So his question is, it seems that N3, the gross margin dilution or drag is more severe than past nodes such as N5 and N7. Is that the case? And also, of course, with N2 upcoming, will we face a similar pattern? Or what is the margin profile for N2? Which I think Wendell can address, yes. Yes, Gokul, it is true that N3 is taking longer time to reach the corporate margin than the other nodes like N5 or N7. N5 or N7 before, it was like 8 to 10 quarters to reach the corporate. But for N3, we think it will take about 10 to 12 quarters. And this is probably because N3 process complexity has increased, and also our corporate average gross margin also increased during the period.
But another reason is that we set the pricing of N3 very early, several years ahead of production. However, we experienced a lot of cost inflation pressures in the following years. So as a result, N3 will take a longer time than N5 and N7 to reach the corporate average gross margin. For N2, based on what we can see so far is that we are doing a better job in cost and selling our value, and we expect N2 to have a better margin profile than N3. The next one to ask a question, Brett Simpson, Arete. I had a question on the AI returns at TSMC. So I think it's clear that AI is producing a large profit pool at your customers. And the HBM is also driving super-normal returns for memory players. So my question is, does TSMC believe they're getting their fair share of the returns in the AI value chain today? And is there scope for TSMC to raise pricing for AI chips in the future? Okay. Thank you, Brett. So Brett's first question is looking at the AI-related demand. He notes that AI customers are earning very good returns, HBM and other components as well. So his question is that whether TSMC, do we feel we are earning or capturing our fair value or right value of the returns? And I think on pricing, how would we price for AI basically, I think. Brett, sorry, that's your question, right? That's it. Well, let me answer the questions. We always say that we want to sell our value, but it is a continuous process for TSMC. And let me tell you that we are working on it. We are happy that our customers are doing well. And if customers do well, TSMC does well. So let me summarize it. We are working on it, and we hopefully that we can sell our value. Right. For my follow-up question, I wanted -- yes, that's great, Jeff. And my follow-up question was on the lighting edge nodes at TSMC. And looking at Q1 sales for 12-nanometer and above, your overall revenues for these nodes collectively was off 20% year-on-year, and it's only 35% of your overall sales. Can you maybe share with us whether you see a recovery at all this year at these nodes? And we're seeing a lot of government support in building out new fabs in the U.S. and China around lighting edge nodes. So are you concerned at all about structural overcapacity for the older nodes to the cycle? Okay. Thank you, Brett. So Brett's second question is more on the mature nodes. He notes that the demand for our mature nodes, 12-nanometer and older, are down year-over-year. So he wonders sort of what is the outlook for the recovery of mature nodes in the second half of the year. I think that's the first part of his question. Okay. Brett, let me answer this question. First, the mature node demand remains sluggish because of a site. As we just announced it, the whole semiconductor industry is gradually recovering, but not fast enough. So we expect to gradually improve in the second half of 2024.
As you mentioned that you -- do we have a concern on the overcapacity because of some of the companies, they continue to build a lot of mature node capacity. For us, actually, our strategy at a mature node is work closely with our strategic customers to develop specialty technology solution to meet their requirement. And we create [ an appreciated ] and long-lasting value to customers. So we have less exposed to this possible overcapacity environment. And we believe that our utilization and profitability on mature node can be well protected. Does that answer your second question, Brett? That's clear. Next one, we have Randy Abrams, UBS. I wanted to ask a question, following up on C. C.'s comment about a ramp profile similar to 3-nanometer for 2-nanometer. Could you clarify for the timing of the meaningful revenue ramp for that node? Is the expectation that would be starting early 2026 and ramping up steep through 2026? Or any potential to pull that in?
And then just a second question on that is you noted that tape-outs are higher. Would there be potential with higher tape-outs in 3 and 5 for either steeper or it ramps to be larger than the prior nodes once underway or looking out a couple of years? Okay. So Randy's first question is around 2-nanometer. So his first question is to C. C. with that we said that the N2 ramp profile will be similar to N3. We also said, of course, the production begins in 2025. So his question partly is, when do we expect to see the revenue contribution, meaningful revenue contribution from N2? And then also that with N2, the tape-outs being higher, what is the multiyear opportunity or contribution from N2 maybe in terms of the revenue as compared to N3 or other nodes? Randy, the N2's ramp profile we say is very similar to N3 because of, look at the cycle time, we start the N2 production in the second half of 2025, actually in the last quarter of 2025. And because of the cycle time and all the kind of back-end process, and so we expect the meaningful revenue will start from the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of 2026. That's what we mean that is the profile is very similar to N3.
Now your second question is there have been a lot of engagement and the tape-out will be higher, and do we see a very steep kind of a production? Well, we do expect that, but let me say again, N2 is a very complicated work or a very complex technology node. So my customer, they also take a little bit longer time to prepare for the tape-out. So that's why they all engage with TSMC in the early stage. And -- but for their product ramp-up, they will have their own product road map and their own business consideration. However, we still say that N2 will be a very, very big node for TSMC.
Randy, does that answer your question? Okay. Great. No, that's helpful color. Yes. Yes, it does. No, helpful color. My second question is just relating to the upward expectations you gave for the AI accelerators. Curious how that ties to how you're looking at the CapEx, if you say that we're entering either higher growth or investment cycle, where capital intensity could need to rise up above that mid-30s range that you set or at least in absolute dollars from the $30 billion this year, we should start growing or thinking about CapEx at least growing with revenue. Okay. So Randy's second question is basically, I think, with such strong AI-related demand, what does this mean for our CapEx and capacity planning? And also, what does this mean for our capital intensity outlook? Yes. Randy, for TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditure is always correlated with higher growth opportunity in the following years. We work with our customers closely, and our CapEx and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile that is underpinned by the multiyear megatrends. We always review our CapEx plan on an ongoing basis. And as a key enabler of AI, we will work with our customers closely to plan the appropriate level of capacity to support their needs. And then in terms of the capital intensity and CapEx dollar outlook. Yes. The capital intensity, in the past few years, it was high as we invested heavily to meet the strong customer demand. Now the increase -- the rate of increase for the CapEx is leveling off. So this year and the next several years, we are expecting that the capital intensity is somewhere at the mid-30s level. But as I just said, if there are opportunities in the future years, then we will invest accordingly. Does that answer your second question, Randy? If I could ask a quick follow-up. Yes, it does. Sorry, I'll ask a quick follow-up. Is this -- would this be viewed as a bit of a digestion year since you ramped a lot of the 3-nanometer spending in the past couple of years? So then as you kick off to -- like I mean, should we look at it at a lower -- or should we see this as kind of a normal in that trend? So I think Randy's question is with -- Randy, you're still asking about CapEx. So is that correct? Yes. Sorry, still on CapEx. If it's a CapEx digestion year, since you've ramped a lot of 3 spending already in the 2-nanometer still, a lot of that is still in front of us. Yes, Randy, I wouldn't call it a digestion year. I mean every year, we invest based on the forward-looking business opportunities, and we constantly review that. So this is what we're seeing in the future, and that's why we're -- the funds that we're investing in. So no, I wouldn't call it a digestion year. Okay? Okay. Good. And next one to ask questions, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley. So my first question is about selling the value. I think another caller also addressed this topic, but I want to go a little bit deeper. Because given all the efforts you made, right, and also ongoing cost challenge made at the coming U.S. fab, electricity cost hike, I'm not sure if you can give investors kind of a range about a potential price adjustment or kind of the value you're going to sell to your customers.
Based on our back testing, I think based on your revenue and shipments in 2022 and 2023, we calculate your price hike could be around 10% in 2022 and the price hike of 5% in 2023. So C. C., I'm not sure whether you are planning to hike price in this kind of a range or magnitude for 2025, so we can be comfortable you can achieve the 53% gross margin in 2025. Okay. So Charlie's first question is about TSMC's pricing strategy. He notes that TSMC, of course, makes a lot of efforts to deliver technology leadership and manufacturing excellence to our customers, but we also face a lot of cost challenges, whether from electricity price hikes or the higher cost of overseas fabs. So his question is, number one, I guess, what is our intention about pricing strategy to sell our value; and then, number two, he would like to know what percentage range, if any? Okay, Charlie, this is C. C. Wei. First, I would like to emphasize again this kind of a pricing strategy is very confidential and totally between TSMC and the customer. However, let me expand a little bit, we do encounter some kind of higher cost in the overseas or even recently, the inflation and the electricity. We expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers.
And as I said, for the overseas fab, we want to share our value, which also includes the flexibility of [ geopolitical ] location or something like that. If my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC and the customer had to share the incremental cost.
Charlie, did I answer your question? Yes, I think that answers my question. I think passing through some cost or all the cost to -- incremental cost to customers should be fair, especially you are creating lots of value to your customers.
And my second question is about AI. I know the -- your cost capacity has been very tight, very strategic. But I'm wondering how you're going to judge the demand and allocate the capacity to all the different type of AI semi customers. Because we're hearing your major customer is demanding for 2x capacity next year.
So I'm wondering how you're going to allocate, so I mean, will you still reserve a certain percentage for some smaller or strategic customers no matter if it's ASIC or smaller GPU vendors? So what is the kind of benchmark you're going to allocate those capacity to customers? And are you okay with that if your major customers' demand cannot be fulfilled by you? Are you okay to give out or do some market share to some of your industry competitors? Okay. So Charlie's second question is around, I guess, basically, our advanced packaging and more specifically, CoWoS. And he, of course, notes that the CoWoS capacity, the demand is very strong today and also into 2025. So the capacity is very tight.
So his question is, how does TSMC decide on how to allocate the capacity to customers, where we have large customers, but will we reserve capacity to support smaller customers as well? And then lastly, would we be okay if customers want to use somebody else, so to speak? So several parts to this question. Charlie, let me say it again, the demand is very, very strong, and we have done our best where we put all the effort to increase the capacity. It's probably more than double this year as compared with last year. However, it's still not enough to meet the customers' demand, and we leverage our OSAT partners to complement of TSMC's capacity to fulfill our customers' need.
Still not enough, of course. But in my mind, my first priority is to make our customer to be successful, no matter which one. And of course, the long-term partners will have a better cooperation with TSMC in terms of technology and processing complexity, so much easier to be ramped up.
However, no matter what, let me say again, the demand is very high, extremely high. And we do our best to increase the capacity to alleviate the shortage. We also leverage the OSAT partners. We want to make sure that all our customers get supported, probably not enough this year; but for next year, we try, we try very hard.
And you mentioned about giving up some market share, that's not my consideration. My consideration is to help our customers to be successful in their market. I see. So since your major customers said there's no room for other type of AI computing chips, but it seems like TSMC is happy to see some similar customers, right? So is that the right interpretation about your comments? Yes. Yes. C. C. said all customers, yes. Thank you, Charlie. Next one to ask questions, Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs. I think, again, the question is coming back to AI still. I think currently, most of the AI accelerators are mostly in 5-nanometers, which is N minus 1 comparing to a smartphone for now. So when do we expect them to catch up or surplus in terms of technology node? Do we see them to be the technology driver in 2-nanometers or above? Okay. So Bruce's first question is about, again, looking at AI accelerators. He notes that in his view, they're currently at 5-nanometer now. His question is, do we expect them to catch up? How do we see AI accelerators and also maybe HPC as a whole being the driver or adopter of TSMC's most leading-edge or advanced technology node? Is that correct, Bruce? Yes, that's correct. Okay. Bruce, let me answer the questions. Yes, your observation is right. Today, all the AI accelerators, most of them are in the 5- or 4-nanometer technology. But my customers are working with TSMC for the next node. Even for the next, next node, they have to move fast because, as I said, the power consumption has to be considered in the AI data center. So the energy-efficient is fairly important. So our 3-nanometer is much better than the 5-nanometer. And again, it will be improved in the 2-nanometer. So all I can say is all my customers are working on this kind of a trend from 4-nanometer to 3 to 2. Bruce? But if that is the case, do we see -- yes, if that is the case, do we see a bigger revenue in the first 2 years of the 2-nanometers? Because in the past, it's only smartphone. But in 2-nanometer, it would be both smartphone and HPC customers. So Bruce is asking then, well, then with such strong AI-related demand, should we see more revenue from 2-nanometer in its first 2 years compared to past nodes? Yes, Bruce, as we said, we believe that it will be -- our advanced technologies will be long-lasting nodes and larger nodes, N2, then N3 or N5. So the dollar value will certainly be larger. I think, Bruce, we're locating at these opportunities in a multiyear period. So as Wendell and C. C. just said, certainly, with the demand that we're seeing, we do expect N2 revenue contribution to be even larger than N3, just like 3 has a larger contribution or larger node than 5, et cetera, et cetera. I see. So my second question is for dividends. We do see very strong free cash flow in the first quarter. And the capital intensity, as Wendell mentioned, is stabilizing. And we even started to pay a huge amount of return in tax. So do we -- can we turn more aggressive in terms of dividends? The current dividend level is much, much lower than 70% of free cash flow in the back-of-envelope calculation. So can we expect to see more dividends in the coming quarters? Okay. Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question is on the cash dividend policy. He notes that in the first quarter, we're generating very, very strong free cash flow. As we have said, the capital intensity is beginning to stabilize and also that we are paying a very high retained earnings tax. So his question, I think, is, what is the outlook? Can we pay more dividends in the coming quarters? Or what should investors expect? Yes. Bruce, the -- our dividend policy is, in principle, to pay 70% of our free cash flow in a year as cash dividends. So I would not just look at quarterly cash, free cash flow to make a judgment. But indeed, as we said before, now that we're harvesting the heavy investment that we did in the past few years, we expect our dividend policy to switch to steadily increasing from the sustainable in the past few years. Next one, we have Laura Chen from Citi. My question is about the edge AI. We know that C. C. mentioned that the smartphone and the PC recovery is still probably prolonged, yet we are also seeing that the AI PC or AI smartphone is getting quite topical. So I'm just wondering, what's TSMC's view on this kind of edge AI device take off maybe later or 2025? And what's the implication to TSMC? That's my first question. Okay. Thank you, Laura. So Laura's first question is on AI, but more specifically edge or what we call on-device AI. She notes that there's AI being added to smartphones and also AI for PCs. It's quite topical. So she wants to know how do we see this trend, more importantly, what is the implication to TSMC. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. Okay, Laura. Let me answer the question. The edge AI or the on-device AI, the first order of magnitude is the die size. We saw without the AI -- with the AI for neuroprocessor inside. The die size will be increased, okay? That's the first we observed. And it's happening.
And then for the future, I would think that replacement cycle for smartphone or for those kind of a PC will be accelerated a little bit in the future, at least. It's not happening yet, but we do expect that it will happen soon. And all in all, I would say that on-device AI will be very positive for TSMC because we capture the larger share of the market.
Did I answer the question, Laura? Yes. And so in that case -- yes, very helpful. So in that case, can we expect that our demand -- and see, because now it's still mostly on the smartphone or mobile. So can we expect that N3's revenue contribution in second half or next year will be bigger, say, like a 20% plus in the second half of this year? Okay. So well, Laura's follow-on to the first question is then should we expect that N3 demand in the second half or into 2025. Sorry, I didn't catch the exact percentage, but a large percentage or significantly larger than it is today. Is that correct, Laura? Yes. Okay. Certainly, as I said, we expect to happen at a larger die size. As I said, we already observed that. And for the replacement cycle to be accelerated, it will happen, but I cannot give you a definite number because of -- it's too early to predict in 2025. But it's an upward trend, no doubt about it, and we expect we have a good business. Just to follow up on C. C.'s comments. Last time, we also said that this year, N3 revenue will be more than triple than the revenue in 2023. Okay. That's very clear. My second question is about, again, advanced packaging. We know that TSMC is working on the 3DIC for many years. So I'm just wondering that what's the current progress? Will we expect to see more meaningful take-off with our N2 ramp-up for like a high-computing PC? And between different kind of technology, like hybrid bonding or TSV, what's TSMC's major consideration? Okay. So Laura's, I guess, second question, although -- yes, fine. Second question is about our advanced packaging solutions and 3DIC solutions. She is wondering, what is the outlook or take-up for the demand for the next several years? And she also would like us to comment on the consideration of TSV versus hybrid bonding and such. Wow, you asked a very technical question about the TSV and the hybrid bonding. It's all together. The 3DIC's packaging technology is very complicated, and our customers start to adopt it. Not a big volume yet, but we expect it to start to grow from this year.
How big it will be? It's hard to say, but I think it is a trend. Whether it is a micro-bumping or it's a hybrid connection, that it depends on the customer's product requirement. Okay, Laura? So starting from this year, we'll see -- yes, yes, just very quickly. So starting from later this year, we will see that 3DIC products from our customers, that's the current progress? So Laura is asking, will we start to see 3DIC products from our customers when? Now. I'm sorry, I just said that the customers start to adopt it from now, and you would expect that product in the market soon. All right? Thank you, Laura. Okay. In the interest of time, maybe we'll take questions from the last 2 participants on the call. Thank you. Operator? Next one, we have Rolf Bulk from New Street Research. Earlier on the call, you mentioned the possibility of converting so much your N5 capacity to N3. But what I was wondering, considering the strong demand for AI chips and a recovery in smartphones, is there a scenario in which you would consider similar conversions from some of your older nodes such as N7 given that utilization and revenues there are still well below peak levels? Okay. So Rolf's first question is about our tool commonality and conversion. He notes that we have already said we are converting some of the capacity -- using some of the N5 tools to support the strong multiyear demand for N3 for AI-related and such. His question is that given our 7-nanometer is still underutilized, will we also consider converting 7-nanometer tools to support more leading-edge stronger demand? Well, let me answer this question. We can convert one technology node capacity to the next one is because of our GI's physical advantage, meaning, let me give you one example, our 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer are adjacent to each other, the fabs, and they are all connected. So it's much easier for TSMC to convert from 5 to 3. And that doesn't mean that every node can do the same. That's one.
And your question about the N7 converted to N5, presumably. No, because we expect the N7 in the next couple of years, it will pick up, the demand will pick up again. And you want repeat -- probably repeat the same kind of experience we have in 28-nanometer. So today, no, we don't have any solid plan to convert the N7 into N5. Okay. Rolf, does that answer your first question? Yes. An unrelated follow-up? Sure. Yes, it does. And unrelated follow-up, it's a follow-up to Laura's question, actually. On SoIC, given that the technology is now being adopted more broadly, do you see beginning of interest of your smartphone customer base to also adopt the technology? Could you comment on the likely time line of adoption of SoIC in smartphones? Okay. So Rolf's second question is basically going back to SoIC adoption. His question really is pretty straightforward. Do we see a time line or can we give a time line for adoption of SoIC by smartphone applications? Well, let me answer the question. Just HPC product is the first one. HPC customer is the first one to adopt, that is a 3DIC or SoIC's advanced packaging technology. And the other area, let's wait, wait and see. I cannot make any comment. We are working on it. Okay? Okay, Rolf? Yes. The last one to ask question, Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Two from my end. You had a very nice upside to revenue expectation for the first half of '24, but has kept the year-end unchanged. Is that a reflection of that slow recovery that you were highlighting? Or would you prefer to wait to have more visibility before updating 2024 target? Okay. So Mehdi's first question is about our revenue outlook and guidance. His question is saying we have a nice upside to our revenue in the first half of this year, but we have kept the full year guidance in to grow low to mid-20s. So is that because we are more cautious on the second half? Or is it because we will see how things go? But I'm not sure if you mean by upside to the first half, Mehdi. You're saying, of course, our first quarter, as C. C. said, was slightly ahead of our guidance in U.S. dollar term, but very minutely. But -- yes? Yes. Mehdi, our guidance for the quarterly profile did not change. We always said that quarter-over-quarter, there will be growth. And also, the full year guidance will stay the same. So I don't think there is a so-called upside, as you just said. To the first half, yes. Yes. Okay. And regarding the investment in U.S., especially for 2-nanometer, does that include advanced packaging? Or would advanced packaging be mostly concentrated in Taiwan region? Okay. So Mehdi's second question is that, of course, that we have announced to build 3 fabs in the U.S., including 2-nanometer, given the strong AI-related demand. So his question is then what about the advanced packaging side, will we also build advanced packaging in Arizona? Or yes, what is our plan? Well, let me answer this question. It is always customer's decision for where the back-end service are done for their product. So in Arizona, we are happy to see that Amkor's recent announcement to build an advanced packaging facility that's very close to our AZ fab. Actually, we are working with Amkor and try to support all our customers in AZ and for their demand, for their need. Okay, Mehdi, does that address your second question? Yes. Okay. Great. All right. Everyone, this concludes our question-and-answer session. Again, we do apologize for the technical difficulties. If you have anything unclear or need to follow up, please contact TSMC's IR, and we'll be more than happy to help.
Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within 30 minutes from now, and the transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which are going to be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.
So thank you again for joining us today. We hope everyone continues to stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see you again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a good day.","TSMC is hosting its earnings conference call via live audio webcast . the company's senior vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the first quarter 2024, followed by our guidance for the second quarter . this is your host for today's event .",0.0

This is Jeff Su, TSMC's Director of Investor Relations and your host for today. Today's event is being webcast live through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. [Operator Instructions]
The format for today's event will be as follows: first, TSMC's Senior Vice President and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang will summarize our operations in the second quarter 2024, followed by our guidance for the third quarter 2024. Afterwards, Mr. Huang and TSMC's Chairman and CEO, Dr. C. C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open both the floor and the line for the Q&A session.
As usual, I'd like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release. And now I would like to turn the microphone over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter 2024.
Second quarter revenue increased 13.6% sequentially in NT or 10.3% in U.S. dollars, as our business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3- and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by the continued smartphone seasonality. Gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 53.2%, mainly reflecting cost improvement and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin dilution from N3 ramp. Due to the operating leverage, total operating expense accounted for 10.5% of net revenue as compared to 11.1% in the first quarter. Thus, operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points sequentially to 42.5%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 9.56 and ROE 26.7%.
Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 15% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17%, respectively. Advanced technology, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 28% quarter-over-quarter to account for 52% of our second quarter revenue, surpassing 50% for the first time. Smartphone decreased 1% to account for 33%. IoT increased 6% to account for 6%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 5% and DCE increased 20% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 2 trillion or USD 63 billion.
On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 23 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 16 billion in the accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 9 billion mainly as we raised TWD 12 billion in corporate bonds. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased by 3 days to 28 days. Days of inventory decreased by 7 days to 83 days, primarily due to higher N3 wafer shipment. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 378 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 206 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 91 billion for third quarter '23 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 101 billion to TWD 1.8 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 6.36 billion.
I finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 22.4 billion and USD 23.2 billion, which represents a 9.5% sequential increase or 32% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.5, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 42.5% and 44.5%. This concludes my financial presentations.
Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our second quarter '24 and third quarter '24 profitability. Our second quarter gross margin was 53.2%, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, mainly as we saw a higher-than-expected overall capacity utilization rate as compared to our forecast 3 months ago. We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to increase by 1.3 percentage points to 54.5% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to the higher overall capacity utilization rate in the third quarter and better cost improvement efforts, including productivity gains, partially offset by continued dilution from N3 ramp-up, N5 to N3 tool conversion costs and higher electricity prices in Taiwan. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over and factoring in the margin impact from our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.
Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years, and our CapEx and capacity planning is always based on the long-term market demand profile. As the strong structural AI-related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. We are narrowing the range of our 2024 capital budget to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion as compared to USD 28 million to USD 32 billion previously. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mass-making and others. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with the higher growth opportunities in the following years. Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C. Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of USD 20.8 billion, above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, particularly offset by continuous smartphone seasonalities. Moving into third quarter 2024. We expect our business to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies.
Looking at the full year 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory to increase by about 10%, which is unchanged from our forecast 3 months ago. At this time, we would like to expand our original definition of foundry industry to foundry 2.0, which also includes packaging, testing, mass-making and others and all IDM, excluding memory manufacturings. We believe this new definition better reflects TSMC's expanding addressable market opportunities in the future. However, I want to emphasize here that TSMC will only focus on the most advanced back-end technologies which help our customers in leading-edge product. Under this new definition, the size of the foundry industry was close to USD 250 billion in 2023 as compared to USD 115 billion under the previous definition.
With our new definition, we forecast the foundry industry growth to be close to 10% year-over-year in 2024. TSMC's share of the foundry industry under our new definition was 28% in 2023, supported by our strong technology leadership and broader customer base, we expect this one to further increase in 2024. Over the past 3 months, we have observed strong AI and high-end smartphone-related demand from our customers as compared to 3 months ago, leading to increasing overall capacity utilization rate for our leading edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer process technologies in the half of 2024, thus we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong growth year for TSMC. We are raising our full year guidance and now expect our 2024 revenue to increase slightly above mid-20s percent in U.S. dollar terms.
Next, I will talk about TSMC's capacity planning process and investment disciplines. This is important especially when we have such high forecasted demand from AI-related business. TSMC's ambition is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. The continued surge in AI-related demand supports a strong structural demand for energy-efficient computing. As a key enabler of AI applications, the value of our technology position is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technology at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. As such, TSMC employs a disciplined framework to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile underpinned by the industry megatrend of AI, HPC and 5G. We work closely with our customers to plan our capacity.
We also have a rigorous and [ rollout ] system that evaluates and judges market demand from both a top-down and bottom-up approach to determine the appropriate capacity to build. Our capital investment decisions are based on 4 disciplines, that is technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning a sustainable and healthy return. To ensure a proper return from our investment, both pricing and costs are important. TSMC's pricing strategy is strategic, not opportunistic to reflect the value that we provide. Today, we are investing heavily in leading-edge, specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support our customers' growth and enable their success. If customers do well, TSMC should do well.
For example, we are happy to see many of our customers structure profitability improving in these past few years. At the same time, we faced rising cost challenges due to increasing project complexity, a leading node, higher electricity costs in Taiwan, global fab expansion in higher cost regions and other cost inflation challenges. And therefore, we will continue to work closely with our customers to see our value. We will also work diligently with our suppliers to deliver on cost performance. We believe such actions will help TSMC earn a sustainable and healthy return so that we can continue to invest in technology and capacity to support our customers' growth and fulfill our mission as a trusted foundry partner while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders.
Finally, I'll talk about our N2 status and N16 introduction. Our 2-nanometer and N16 technologies, this is an industry in addressing the sensible need for energy-efficient computing and almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC. We expect the number of the new tape-outs for 2-nanometer technologies in its first 2 years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years. N2 deliver full node performance and power benefit which 10 to 15 speed improvement at the same power or 25% to 30% power improvement at the same speed and more than 15% chip density increase as compared with N3E.
N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track, all ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, we also introduced N2P as an extension of our N2 family. N2P features a further 5% performance with -- at the same power or 5% to 10% power benefit at the same speed on top of N2. N2P will support both smartphone and HPC applications and volume production is scheduled for the second half 2026.
We also introduced N16 as our next nano chip-based technology, featuring super power rail or SPR, as a separate offering. TSMC's SPR is innovative, best-in-class backside power delivery solution that is the first in the industry to incorporate a novel backside contact scheme to preserve gate density and device with flexibility. Compared with N2P, N16 provides a further 8% to 10% speed improvement at the same power or 15% to 20% power improvement at the same speed and additional 7% to 10% chip density gain. N16 is best suited for specific HPC product with complex signal route and dense power delivery network. Volume production is scheduled for second half 2026. We believe N2, N2P, N16 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the growth opportunities well into the future. This concludes our key messages, and thank you for your attention. Thank you, C. C. Thank you, Wendell. This does conclude our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Now we will begin the Q&A session. I would like to take the first few questions from the floor, then we will go on to the call. So let's begin. The first question, we please take from Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan. Thanks for giving us the picture in terms of how you are planning future capacity. Just on AI accelerator and related capacity both front end and advanced packaging, clearly, every customer is queuing up at TSMC for capacity. I think last time we talked about this maybe a couple of quarters back, C. C., you mentioned we expect to see supply to kind of reach balance -- supply/demand to reach balance by end of this year. Just wanted to see what is your current remark. How do you think about supply/demand balance for AI accelerator and CoWoS advanced packaging capacity? And I think in your symposium, you talked about 60% CAGR, compounded growth for CoWoS capacity in the next 4, 5 years. Could you talk a little bit about how much capacity for CoWoS would you be planning to build next year as well? Like last year, you said you're going to be doubling the capacity this year. Now that we are in the middle of this year, maybe can we get a view on what is the capacity expansion for next year? That's my first question. Okay, Gokul. All right. For the benefit of the audience online and in person, please allow me to kind of try to summarize your question. So Gokul's question, first of all, he understands and appreciates TSMC's disciplined framework in terms of looking at how to build capacity. His question is that it seems that everyone today, AI accelerators and advanced packaging is queuing at TSMC to ask for capacity. So his question is, when do we, C. C., expect supply/demand to reach a balance both for the accelerator side? And then for the CoWoS. At the symposium, we said CoWoS capacity will grow at a 60% CAGR the next few years. He also wants to know what are we planning to build or increase for 2025 CoWoS. Gokul, I also tried to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot today. The demand is so high. I had to work very hard to meet by customers demand. We continue to increase. I hope sometime in 2025 or 2026, I can reach the balance. You're talking about the CAGR of gross increase of the CoWoS capacity. Now it's out of my mind. I mean we continue to increase whatever, wherever, whatever I can, okay? The supply continues to be very tight all the way to probably 2025 and hope it can be eased in 2026. That's today's situation. Any thoughts on next year capacity? Like are you going to double your capacity again next year for CoWoS? The last time I say that this year, I doubled it, right, more than double, okay? So next year, if I say double it, probably, I will answer your question again next year, and say more than double, okay? We're working very hard, as I said, wherever we can, whenever we can. My second question is regarding gross margins. I think second half guidance already seems to be better than what originally we were thinking that gross margin could drop in second half, but looks like it's actually going up. And it looks like a lot of the headwinds on gross margin is coming in this year. So how should we think about gross margin looking forward for TSMC? Are we going to get back to the high 50%, 60% gross margin that we saw in 2022, given that you got -- you're selling more of your value, you have some of the N3 tailwinds in terms of yield improvement coming through? Into that, I will also ask how should we think about impact of subsidies and ITC credits as you start ramping your overseas locations? How does that impact cost and gross margin? Because there's also some subsidies coming in and currently, TSMC is mostly talking about gross CapEx and gross spend. Okay. So let me summarize Gokul's second question is around gross margin and profitability. He notes second half '24 gross margin seems to be better than the expectation. So his question is really, how should we think about gross margin in the next several years? He notes as we said, we will sell our value and the dilution of N3 will gradually reduce. So where can the gross margins go back to a high 50s or 60% that kind of level that we saw a few years ago in 2022. Maybe that's the first part of his second question. I'll stop here, then I'll get to the second. Sure. Gokul, let me share with you some of the puts and takes on gross margin 2025 and a little bit beyond that. You already talked -- there are positives and there are negatives. You already mentioned a positive will be a decrease in dilution from N3. We're selling our value, and we continue to drive down our costs, increase the productivity. That is -- we are very good at that. On the other hand, let's use N5 conversion to N3 as an example. We are not ruling out the possibility of further converting more N5 to N3 because we're seeing very strong demand for N3 if we decided to do that, of course, there will be a negative impact on the year that we do that. But in the future years, that will be beneficial.
We continue to face cost challenges, inflation cost challenges, including electricity prices, et cetera. And also, we are beginning the production overseas fab, 2 overseas fabs next year. the Phase 1 of Arizona fab and Phase 1 of the Kumamoto fab. We expect that the overseas fabs will dilute our gross margins by between 2 to 3 percentage points next year and in the next several years. So those are the puts and takes to give you the concept. However, we've taken all that into considerations with our efforts in managing cost fab especially between the overseas fab in Taiwan, we're repeating and confident to say that 53% and higher gross margin is achievable. So I think that's the first part of your question. Yes, that's right. And then maybe also just Gokul asked if it's possible to get back to the high 50%, 60% level that we saw in 2022? Yes, if we have a very high utilization rate, everything else stays the same, possible. And then okay. And then the second part of his question was what is the impact from the different government incentives, including the CHIPS Act, ITC credits in the U.S., et cetera, to the financials and also, I think, partly gross CapEx and net CapEx. Generally speaking, when subsidies are received, then you see that on the cash flow statement, it will be used to offset the asset value that will be on the balance sheet. When this fab begins to production, the P&L impact will come in. So generally speaking, it's like that. Different government has different approach in providing the grants. So that's a different story. But you can look at our financial statements, there will be actual subsidy received in the period of previous quarter and previous year. For example, 2023, we received a total subsidies of slightly higher than USD 1.5 billion equivalent, and we received that mainly in Japan. Yes. Okay. All right. Great. Let's move on. We'll take the next one from Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley and then we'll go to Bruce Lu from Goldman. So I have -- my first question is really about your progress of selling the value. I'm not sure what's the progress, and do you think for next year, your leading edge capacity is going to be in shortage? If that's the case, whether that increases your chance to sell more value to your customers? Okay. So Charlie's first question is around pricing, and he wants to understand the progress of, I guess, selling our value. And also next year, looking at next year, particularly for the leading-edge nodes, do we expect that in terms of the demand to be very full. Charlie, this kind of pricing strategy is very strategic. You are asking me about the status, so far, so good. And we are continue -- this is an ongoing and continuous process. We are continuing to share our value. And by the way, my customer are doing very well also, okay? You knew that. So we should do well also. Yes, so that is actually my follow-up question on this first question. For different segments, for example, HPC customers are doing very, very well. But for smartphone customers probably more sensitive to the cost. Do you expect the kind of difference of kind of value increase for different customers, even at a same node? So Charlie is asking how will we do the pricing? Will it be different between, for example, an HPC customer versus a smartphone customer at the same node? And also his question earlier was, do we expect the demand for the leading nodes to be very high next year? I think the pricing is strategic. So it won't be flat for average product sector. So it will be different, okay? That all I can share with you. And all my customers, they are looking for leading-edge as a capacity for the next few years, and we are working with them. And so far, we try our best to support them, both in pricing and in capacity. And second topic is definitely over the past 2 days, there is a geopolitical risk, right? So Mr. Donald Trump talked about maybe a few years ago, right, Taiwan/TSMC took 100% chip business from U.S.. So congrats on the bounce back pretty high market share. However, the concern is growing, right, that the U.S. continues to depend on our Tainan, TSMC and the chip production. So our question is for shareholders, right, how TSMC is going to mitigate this potential geopolitical risk? For example, whether you are going to further expand your U.S. capacity or even share the ownership, right, with the U.S. government? And maybe a technical question to Wendell, for today, right, if we are shipping a chip to the U.S. customers, do we need to pay for the U.S. tariff? Okay. Sorry. So Charlie's second question is around sort of overseas expansion and geopolitical risk. He notes the comments from former President Trump a few days ago that Taiwan semiconductor has taken 100% of the business. So his question is really how does TSMC plan to mitigate the geopolitical risk? Does this include expanding capacity overseas, particularly in the U.S.? Would we consider -- I think part of his question was some JV or joint investments, whether with government or whether with partners. And the last question, I think, was more for Wendell about the tax or the tariffs, so to speak. Okay, Charlie. So far, we did not change any of our original plan of expansion of our overseas fab. We continue to expand in Arizona, in Kumamoto and maybe future in Europe. No change to our strategy. We continue our current practice. You mentioned about the JV, no. Okay. On the tariff, not that we know of. Normally, if there's an import tariff, the customers will be responsible for that, but no discussion, nothing. Okay. Thank you, Charlie. All right. We'll take the next question from Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs in the front, then we'll move online. All right, my question is that, why don't we take up our gross margin or structure profitability target? I mean TSMC has been saying for selling your value for past couple of quarters without changing the margin target, i.e., most likely you are passing through all the costs. But please, I can recall in 2021, I mean, TSMC do raise the gross margin target by then because to support the future growth with more R&D, as the technology continues to be enhanced and more difficult and one of your customers and this is supportive that to suggest that you should charge even more. So my question is that why is that you don't raise your gross margin target when you are trying your -- when you try to sell your value, which we believe we deserve much higher value. Okay. So thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's first question is about profitability and value. Bruce seems to agree that TSMC is providing value to our customers. He also notes in 2021, indeed, a few years ago, our gross margin target, long-term gross margin target was about 50%, and we're able to increase that to 53% and higher. So his question is really with everything that is going on today with the value of our technology, enabling our customers more and more, why doesn't TSMC increase or revise up our long-term gross margin target from the current 53% and higher? Is that the essence? Yes. Bruce, thank you for recognizing TSMC's value. I'm working with our customer. As I said, this kind of pricing is strategic. And certainly, we want to sell our value. Changing the target in -- at this moment, I think I would like to emphasize 53% and higher, please put more attention to and higher. The number, I'm not going to change it at this time. When I have more conversation with my customer and discuss with them, and I probably will give you and higher portion, okay? Thank you. Okay. My next question is for advanced packaging. So management used to mention that Advanced Packaging margin was lower than the corporate average, but with higher ROEs. But given the recent progress for the CoWoS and everything, do we see a much better profitability for the CoWoS? And given that it's so difficult to expand the capacity, are you planning to work with more partners to increase your CoWoS supply, which will solve your current supply and demand issues? Okay. Thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's second question is around advanced packaging. Part of it is in terms of the profitability. He notes we used to say, which is true, it's lower than the corporate average profitability but can earn a similar return or ROE, but his question is now with more and more CoWoS demand and greater scale is the profitability of advanced packaging, I think, approaching or at or above the corporate average? And also, given the tight supply, would we consider to work with more partners to help increase the capacity for CoWoS to support our customers' growth. You are right, for advanced packaging, the gross margin used to be much lower than the corporate average. Now it's approaching corporate average. We are improving it that's because of scale of the economics, and we put a lot of effort to reduce our cost. So gross margin is greatly improving in these 2 years. As for the working with OSAT partners, yes, we are doing it because of -- I just answered the question whether the CoWoS capacity is enough or not? Is not enough. And in great shortage, and that limited my customers' growth. So we are working with our OSAT partner and trying to give more capacity to my customer so that they can grow here. And so the TSMC's wafer can be sold here. Okay. Okay. Thank you, C. C. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move to the first participant online for their -- his or her questions, please? Yes. The first one, we've got Brett Simpson, Arete. Yes. My question was really about your capacity plans for the next nodes at N2, including A16. We're hearing that AI chipmakers are looking to migrate more aggressively from N-1 to the leading edge, particularly due to backside power because they're trying to lower their power budgets going forward. So my question, can you support this move? And if so, should we be expecting N2, A16 to be structurally a much bigger node than we've seen in the past few nodes? Okay. Brett, thank you. So Brett's first question is on capacity planning, particularly at the leading-edge N2 and A16. So he notes rightly that AI customers are migrating aggressively from N-1 in the past to the most leading node. He notes particularly A16 driven by the interest in backside power. So his question is can we support this move in terms of capacity to support the customers and also whether thus N2 and A16 will be a much bigger node than our notes in the past? Brett, you are right. All the people want to move into kind of a power-efficient mode. And so they are looking for the more advanced technology so that they can save power consumption. And so a lot of my customers want to move into N2, N2P, A16 quickly. We are working very hard to build the capacity to support them. Today, it's a little bit tight, not a little bit, actually, today is very tight. I hope in next year or the next 2 years, we can build enough capacity to support this kind of demand. Today, yes, we are working hard to support them. And enough? Not yet, but we are working hard to get it. Does that answer your first question, Brett? Okay. Yes, that's great. My follow-up question was for Wendell. I wanted to just dig into the gross margin dilution from N3, where is that at today? And does the introduction of N3E structurally improve your N3 returns? I guess N3 is less capital intensive. There's less EUV layers, so I'm keen to understand that this drives better economics for TSMC, particularly as you start to ramp more N3 capacity in the second half of this year? All right. Thanks, Brett. So Brett's second question is on the gross margin dilution from N3. He notes that N3E uses less EUV layers, less capital intensity. So his question is, as we ramp N3 more and more, does N3E structurally improve the returns in gross margin of N3 as a whole. Okay. Brett, we don't break it down between the different nodes within the family. But I can share with you, overall speaking, as we said before, N3E takes a longer while to reach the copper mark. In the past, it was about 8 to 10 quarters. For N3, we're looking at 10 to maybe 12 quarters. But it is improving, and we expect it to continue to improve. Okay. Thank you, Brett. Operator, let's take the next set of questions from the next participant on the call, please. Next one to ask a question, Charles Shi from Needham. Maybe the first one, just want to follow up. Wendell, I think I heard you talking about that potentially more imply to N3 conversion. Maybe beyond what you're trying to do right now, the conversion. I just want to understand the overall philosophy here because I think in the past, the TSMC does do this node-to-node conversion quite actively, let's say, 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer, and probably even earlier 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer. And I think you told us basically treat 10 and 7 as 1 large node, 20 and 16 as 1 large node. Should we start to really think about maybe 5 and 3 are just 1 big node and maybe more conversion -- we should think about more of the N3 capacity growth will come from conversion going forward less from the greenfield investment? That's the first question. Okay, Charles. So Charles' first question is really look at our conversion strategy. He notes that we have always talked about building in tool commonality to provide us flexibility. We have done so in the past at certain nodes like 20 and 16, 10 and 7. So his question is really we have said that we potentially convert more N5 tools to support the strong demand for N3 capacity. So his question is should we, investors, analysts start to think about N5 and N3 as 1 big node. Okay, right. You mentioned about 12 and 16, they are a big family. 7 and 10 are a big family. But 5 and 3 are not a big family in our definitions. At the same time, there are node-to-node tool commonality in TSMC is pretty high. So for 5 and 3, the commonality of tools is over 90%, and these 2 nodes are adjacent. They're all in Tainan Science Park. And so it's very easy to do the conversions. Did I answer your questions? Yes. May I ask a second question? Certainly. Maybe a question about CoWoS. I think I heard C. C., you said maybe there's some technical difficulty on my side. I just want to clarify, maybe you may double the CoWoS capacity again in 2025. But a little bit more technical question I do want to better understand the technology constraints because your customers seems to be migrating from CoWoS-S to the more advanced version CoWoS-L, CoWoS-R and we learned that CoWoS L, R does not require TSV, does not require a large silicon interposer, does that help at least to some degree, the capacity constraints you're facing on overall CoWoS? And does that help maybe to achieve that goal of maybe getting to the supply/demand balance some point in 2025, 2026? That's a two-part question. Okay, Charles. So Charles' question is really on CoWoS. First, he would like to clarify, we said that CoWoS capacity is more than doubling in 2024. He said, did we say, is he correct to understand, we said it will double again in 2025. That's the first clarification. And then he would like to know as customers migrate from CoWoS-S to CoWoS-L and CoWoS-R solution, a lot of technical challenges or benefits -- changes, sorry, not challenges. Does it help alleviate the capacity constraints? And would that allow CoWoS to reach supply/demand balance in 2025? So one to clarify and one on the different solutions. Well, all right. Charles, you really know all the details of the technology. The CoWoS-R, CoWoS-S, CoWoS-L blah, blah, blah. All these kind of things because of our customers' requirement. So even the same customer, they have different approaches for their different products. When I say that we doubled the capacity, this is summing all the different version of the CoWoS together. Which portion is really double which portion is much more than the other one, I'm not going to share with you because this is related to my customers' demand. So from last year to this year, we have more than doubled. And as I said, from this year to next year, we want to double again or probably we want to more than double again. But still, I have to work with our OSAT partner to increase the overall supply to support my customer. Whether that this kind of different version of the CoWoS will give me some flexibility today, yes, and no, because different version has a different tool set. But in common, some of the tools can be used by all the CoWoS, okay, but different versions have like a different demand. Okay. Thank you, C. C. Thank you, Charles. We'll come back to the floor for the next 2 questions, please. We'll take the first one from Laura Chen from Citigroup, and then we'll go to Sunny Lin from UBS. My first question is also on the advanced node. I remember C. C., you mentioned earlier that every clients are now engaged with you on the 2-nanometer's migration. So I'm just wondering that when we enter in maybe 2026, the third -- the second year, can we expect that the revenue contribution initially will be larger than what we had comparing to N3? And also wondering that since the performance is much better. So can we expect the dilution's period will also be shorter than N3? Okay. Sorry. Sorry. So Laura's first question is about N2 basically that almost every customer is engaging with TSMC on 2-nanometer technology. So her question is do we expect the revenue contribution from N2 in 2026, therefore, to be larger than compared to N3 at a similar point in time of the ramp and also correspondingly with the N2 margin dilution be less or better than N3, basically. I will give this kind of money's question to the CFO. Okay, all right. Laura, the revenue, yes, it's going to be bigger, okay? Gross margin dilution, it will be faster to reach corporate average. That's very clear and helpful. And also my second question is also on the packaging side. So we know that last time we also discussed an edge AI will also benefit for TSMC in terms of the advanced nodes, the dye areas. Just wondering that do you also see your edge AI device clients they are moving to 3DIC or SoIC anytime in the next 2 years? Or before that happening, can we expect more clients on the smartphone side, they will also adapt maybe info first. Because so far, our understanding is that info only have one advanced 1 single client. I'm just wondering that if we see that more clients to move to on the edge AI side on advanced packaging. Okay. So Laura's second question is very specific, but again, in regards to advanced packaging with more and more customers working on edge AI devices without -- well, being overly specific, but what does it mean or the implication for advanced packaging solutions that we expect in the next 2 years to see these edge AI customers start to use SoIC or 3DIC particularly smartphone? Will they still be using info? Or will they also consider these solutions as well. Is that correct, Laura? Okay. Well, very technical questions. Let me share with you as my customer moving into 2-nanometer or A16, they all need to probably take in the approach of chiplets. So once you use your chiplets, you have to use in advanced packaging technologies. On the edge AI, for those kind of smartphone customer, as compared with the HPC customers, HPC is moving faster because of bandwidth concerns, latency of footprint or all those kind of thing. For smartphone customer, they need to pay more attention to the footprint as well as the functionality increase. So you observe my big customers taking the info first and then for a few years, nobody catch it up. They are catching up okay? Okay. Thank you, Laura. We'll take the next question from Sunny Lin from UBS, and then we'll go back to the call. So my first question is on your business opportunities for smartphone and PC. Last few years, both were [indiscernible] growth for quite some time. And so how we should think about the units and silicon content for the coming 2, 3 years? First part, a lot of questions on the tight supply 5 and 3-nanometer? And so are your customers engaging with you early on the planning into 2025 capacities for a better upgrade cycle? And then for silicon content, recall a few years back when 5G just started to ramp you used to provide the silicon content expectations of 5G high-end and mid-end and low-end smartphones, so I wonder at this point of time, if you have any estimates for AI for smartphone going to next 2, 3 years? Okay. Several parts to Sunny's first question. She's looking at smartphone and PC. So the first part is she wants to know in terms of unit in silicon content, what is our expectation for smartphone and PCs in the next few years? N5 and N3 supply is very tight in terms of the capacity. Can -- do we have enough capacity to support a potential unit or upgrade cycle? And last but not least, she's asking us to quantify the silicon content per device per segment from edge AI. That's a very long question. But let me answer the content first. AI is so hard. So that's right now everybody -- all my customers want to put the AI functionality into the edge devices and so the dye size will be increased, okay? How much? I mean it's different from my customer-to-customers product. But basically, probably 5% to 10% dye size increase will be a general rule. Unit growth, not yet, okay? Because we did not see kind of unit growth suddenly increased, but we expect this AI functionality was stimulated some of the demand to stimulate the replacement to be shorter. So in terms of unit growth that in a few years later, probably 2 years later, you will start to see a big increase in the edge device that's a smartphone and the PC. And will we have enough capacity to support? That's the one I tried to avoid the answer. It's very, very tight, and we are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support my customer from now all the way to next year to 2026. So my second question is try to look at the demand profile from different perspectives. If we look back in 2021 or early 2022, back then demand was also pretty high. Customers were very aggressive on the demand forecast. Now looking at GenAI, obviously, the technology has lots of great potential, but a new technology also have lots of volatilities where you start to ramp. And so how are we managing the volatilities of the demand? Why do you think this time around it is different versus COVID period? How do we get comfortable with our capacity planning? Okay. Thank you, Sunny. So Sunny's second question, is goes back to TSMC capacity planning and CapEx framework. So she notes we -- today, generative AI-related demand is very strong, but she also noted a few years ago back in 2021 and '22, demand was also very strong. Many customers were also very positive or being on the future demand. And so today, with such strong generative AI demand, how does TSMC plan its capacity appropriately? How do we manage -- I think your word was volatility? How do we manage the risk? Basically, I guess, of not overbuilding capacity in this type of environment? I thought I explained that our capacity premium process, right, and the investment, we have -- I put a wording of discipline. That means we are not going to repeat the same kind of mistake that we have in 2021, 2022. Now this time, again, we look at the overall very big demand forecast for my customer. And so I look at it into actually the whole company with many people now examining and study that really is AI is so used for will be used by a lot of people or not. And we test ourself first inside TSMC, we are using AI, we are using machine learning skill to improve our productivity, and we found out it's very useful. And so I also in the line to buy my customer's product, and we have to form in the line, like I cannot privilege here, I'm sorry, but it's useful.
And so I believe that this time, AI's demand is more real than 2 or 3 years ago. At that timing it is because people were afraid of a shortage, and so automotive, everything, you name it, they are all in shortage. This time, AI alone only AI alone, it will be a very useful tool for the human being to improve all the productivity in our daily life, be it in medical industry or in any product, manufacturing industry or autonomous driving, everything you need AI. And so I believe it's more real. But even with that, we also have a top-down bottom-up approach and discuss with our customers and ask them to be more realistic. I don't want to repeat the same kind of mistake 2 or 3 years ago, and that's what we are doing right now. Okay. Thank you. Operator, can we move on to the next participant from the line, please? Okay. If not, then maybe we'll take the last 2 questions from the floor or 1 or 2. Let's start here and then here. So we'll start with our third line from Arthur Lai from Macquarie. Arthur Lai from Macquarie. I used to cover the downstream tech and especially data center before. And so I want to ask about the SPR because I think this is very important from the data center perspective. So when you bring the new technology, you can save around 20% power. Can we also think about you can save the total systems power consumption by another 20%. So is a big change. And from the customer you asked or you spoke to, is the -- they can also you said the total cost of our own operation. So it becomes the more you buy, the more you save. Yes. Okay. So Arthur's first question, he would like to understand more about super power rail or our best-in-class backside power solution as it relates to data center demand. He knows as we said that it brings greater power efficiency from the chip level. His question without specific numbers, but what does it mean for the system level power consumption saving? What does it mean for our customers' ability in terms of total cost of ownership in terms of the power savings? And does it mean that the more you buy, the more you save? The more you buy TSMC's wafer, the more you save. Yes. Sorry, I just want to -- I like my customer. Your question, Arthur, you say that 20% sales in the chips power consumption does that directly reply to indicate that the system power consumption was reduced by 20%. Probably not because of the whole system including the connection, including the networking, including the processes of power consumption. So unless every component save 20%, then you can achieve 20%. But again, the accelerator or the CPU is a big portion of the whole system's power consumption. So even it is not 20%, it's a significant portion of it. And so that's why all my customers want to using the leading edge, and they are very aggressive to move into the 2-nanometer technology. Thank you. So I also encourage the company to do the right thing. So energy efficiency computing is definitely our goal for human beings. And so I also, I would like to give more color about when you go into the A16 and when we expand the capacity, what do you think the biggest bottleneck would be? Okay. So Arthur, second question is in terms of A16 what would be the biggest bottleneck to expand our capacity of A16 to support our customers, if any. We always say that when TSMC wants to expand the capacity, we need the land, we need the electricity, we need the talented people and so all the above. Okay. Thank you. And then in the interest of time, we'll take questions from the last participant on the floor, which is Brad Lin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I have two questions. The first one would be on the, during the compute test. We obviously have seen quite some big tech companies announced that they are going to accelerate the launch cadence. So what's the implication to TSMC? Should that give TSMC a better visibility on the pipeline and also the capacity planning? And on the other side, so what are the major challenges that you might face with this phase [indiscernible]? Okay. So Brad's first question is that COMPUTEX recently, several companies announced their intention to accelerate their product cadence or product launches. So his question is, what does this mean implications to TSMC in terms of capacity planning in terms of supporting our customers, et cetera, et cetera. Is that right? Okay. Okay. Well, we like this kind of a trend because of TSMC is very good at the leading-edge development. And so we -- actually, every product once they design it takes 1.5 years to 2 years. So we got this kind of message, but quite a long time ago. My customer announce it because they are so happy. And so we are happy also because they want us to see our value. So I take that otherwise. But Gokul last. Okay. So to answer your question, yes, we have been prepared. And not only because of in June, they announce it, we much earlier, we already discussed with them, and we prepare for these kind of changes. So I would assume that would help us kind of sell the value easier. So the second question will be on the -- well, obviously, we also see the bigger footprint of the AI chips. So while there are quite some activities about fan-out panel-level packaging. So do you think that, that solution will be mentioned in the mid- to long run? Or does TSMC have any plan to do the related investment? Okay. So Brad, second question is that, again, with AI-related chips that they're larger and larger die sizes. So his question is in terms of advanced packaging and specifically fan-out panel-level packaging. Is this something that TSMC is looking at or exploring to do? Would this be something for TSMC in the mid- to long term? Yes. we are looking at this as kind of a panel level fan-out technology. But the maturity today is not yet, so I -- personally, I will think it's about at least 3 years later, okay? In this, within these 3 years, we don't have any very solid solution for a dye size bigger than 10x of the radical size. Today, we support our customer all the way to 5x, 6x chip size. I'm talking about the [ fuel ] size, the big [indiscernible] size. 2 years later, I believe the panel fan-out will be -- start to be introduced and we are working on it. And we will be ready for it as well. Of course. All right. Thank you, C. C. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session.
