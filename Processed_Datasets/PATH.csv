Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Kelsey and thank you to everyone for joining us on our first earnings call as a public company. We had a very strong start to the year. Before I begin, I'd like to acknowledge the impact COVID-19 continues to have around the world and especially in India, we are actively supporting our colleagues and their families in the region and recently contributed over a million in corporate and employee donations to send and distribute oxygen supplies in the region. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by this ongoing pandemic.
Turning to the business. Our leadership position in the RPA market is again demonstrated by our ARR growth, which increased 64% year-over-year to 653 million, while net new ARR record 72 million. We continue to grow multiples of the market and take market share. In fact, for 2020 IBC announced that UiPath ranked number one in RPA, capturing 8 points of share versus 2019. In Gartner's latest market share research UiPath added more revenue in 2020 than our top nine competitors combined. We believe that automation will be the next layer in the software stack. It brings together IT and knowledge workers to deliver the agility necessary to quickly adapt and respond to constantly changing business conditions. And it simplifies the sprawl of applications and database.
Our vision is to enable the fully automated enterprise through our unique combination of UI automation, API management and AI-based computer vision to emulate human workers and the sign, or automatable work to robot. This is an incredible market opportunity. And automation is in our DNA. We have more than 15 years of market experience, including insights from our over 8500 customers, which we believe gives us a significant advantage in the market.
The result is a unique combination of, first, our end-to-end automation platform that addresses the broadest number of use cases. Second, flexible deployment models, including on-prem, hybrid, multi-cloud, and SaaS. And third, a large and growing ecosystem of go-to-market and technology partners, as well as the vast community of trained automation professionals. All of this results in first time to value for our customers and tremendous return on investment that drives our automation first mindset.
And we are not standing still, as we continue to expand our competitive mode. Our ultimate product vision is for our user, not only to automate existing processes, but to design processes on our platform. This is the board's objective, and one we think is possible to achieve in the coming years as we push the boundaries of innovation. To that end, in May, we announced important new platform capabilities with the introduction of UiPath 21.4. These include three new products, cloud insights, automation cloud robot, and test mining, as well as over 100 major new features and deeper integrations across every pillar of our end-to-end platform.
New enterprise scale management and governance control and AI powered discovery, privatization and integrated development of the most impactful automation, including general availability as test mining.
We also significantly expanded our automation cloud capabilities to migrate, build, manage and measure enterprise scale automation in the cloud. Automation cloud, software robots deliver unattended robot capacity as needed, with no infrastructure were management required by customers. As of the end of the first quarter, more than 2200 customers have adopted automation cloud feedback during the better process for 21.4 has been extremely positive. And I'm incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished. 21.4 truly reflects the cutting edge capabilities, our customers need to accelerate their automation programs.
It is the combination of user interface and API automation along with AI computer vision that differentiates us and enables human emulation in a resilient manner. In March, we expanded our API capabilities with the acquisition of Cloud Elements. This is a great example of how strategic tuck-in acquisitions, accelerate our product roadmap and bring talent to the team. To further accelerate customer success, we have built an ecosystem of go-to-market and technical partners, as well as a thriving UiPath community.
For example, we are very pleased to have recently launched a tableau activity with the world's leader in visual analytics, users can now easily utilize data fully automated, produce, or retrieve by robotic automations in their tableau reports. In addition, the UiPath extension for tableau enables users to trigger a robot directly from a tableau report or dashboard.
On the go-to-market side, we grew our worldwide partner base by more than 35% year-over-year to more than 4000. We'll also expanded several partnerships, including Deloitte, which is now the first GSI to become a certified UiPath service network partner. They now have the most advanced training and resources to deliver UiPath implementations with a certified level of quality and rigor.
In addition, we announced a global agreement with Ingram Micro introducing a dedicated Ingram Micro team of UiPath experts to raise brand awareness and help channel partners sell solution and provide RPA to their business clients. Ingram Micro is also UiPath customer, using our end-to-end platform to bring more efficiency and automation for 1000s of its internal citizen developers worldwide. Today, their team has automated 100 plus processes and has plans in place to do even more. And finally, we continue to expand our UiPath community with the addition of seven historically black colleges and universities to our academic alliance.
Robotic engineering is one of the fastest emerging jobs globally. And we are committed to democratize RPA technology and skills through our academic alliances, so that more people can be successful in the future of work. We will continue to push the boundaries of the fully automated enterprise and have recently been very gratified by important industry recognition.
For example, in March, we were named a leader in the Forrester Wave, Robotic Process Automation among the 14 vendors evaluated UiPath, the highest ranking in each of three categories, current offering strategy and market presence. We are humbled by this acknowledgement. And we will strive to maintain our leadership position.
Before I turn the call over to Ashim and we take questions, I would like to thank our employees, partners and shareholders for their confidence in UiPath as we take this next step in our journey. We firmly believe that we are at the beginning of a unique market opportunity that will truly change how people experience work.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ashim to discuss our Q1 performance and guidance in more detail. Thank you, Daniel. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We are very excited to be embarking on this next phase as a public company.
I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, which yet again delivered meaningful growth at scale. Given our total addressable market of over $60 billion, the continued expansion of our automation platform and our validated lead in the market, we believe there remains ample room for us to continue to drive durable long-term growth.
As the market leader we know the inflection point in the adoption of automation is now as customers are choosing their long-term strategic partner. And as our results underscore, we are consistently winning these competitive evaluations and plan to continue to innovate, invest and execute to widen our competitive moat, with a focus on first extending our technology leadership. Second, expanding our ecosystem of go-to-market and technical partners, as well as our community. And finally attracting and retaining world-class talent.
Before discussing the details of the quarter, I would like to emphasize the financial strengths of our business model. We have a highly recurring subscription based business primarily contracted annually and billed in advance. Our technology is incredibly sticky, resulting in best in class dollar base gross retention and net retention rates. We offer our customers flexible deployment models on-prem, hybrid cloud and SaaS, the mix of which can create lumpy revenue recognition, particularly from licensed revenue under ASC 606. As a result, we remind you that we run and manage our business on ARR, which is most representative of the underlying performance of our business.
Moving on to first quarter results, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated.
First quarter ARR was $652.6 million up 64%. We delivered record incremental ARR, which grew 55% to $72.1 million. We ended the quarter with more than 8500 customers with great new logos including a flyboard Global Healthcare Exchange overstock Ralph Lauren, Siemens Mobility and the State of North Carolina.
Expansion metrics remain best-in-class as existing customers accelerated their adoption of our platform and deployment of our software robots. We now have 1105 customers that account for at least $100,000 in ARR, up sequentially from 1002 including 104 customers at a million dollars plus up sequentially from 89. Notable new logos and customer expansions during the quarter included; first Verizon Communications, which became a customer in July 2019 to support their attended automation needs. After their successful initial deployment, Verizon shifted their focus to how they could use our full platform to achieve automation at scale. While continuing to expand their attended automation footprint, they are planning to now also focus on finding transformational business insights using process mining to enable a workforce of unattended robots. Verizon now benefits from the value of our end-to-end an interconnected automation platform.
Second, Fifth Third Bancorp started their automation journey with UiPath in April 2020 as a part of a broader digital transformation efforts. To move to our platform using document understanding and process mining accelerated their automation program, a common thread we often see, helping the bank tackle some of the highest impact processes faster. In the past quarter, we entered into a long-term partnership to not only increase efficiency across their employee base, but also improve customer satisfaction.
And finally, Hackensack Meridian Health, the largest hospital system in New Jersey, which became a customer in late 2019, started their program in the finance department. Beginning in 2020, they set up a full automation program and delivered 70 automations in seven months across finance and accounting, revenue cycle management, accounts payable and IT saving approximately $1.2 million.
Given the success of the program in its initial phase in April 2021, HMH expanded their program to multiple departments, including IT, purchasing and HR. To accelerate automations, HMH enabled a new class of citizen developers added test suite for faster implementations and introduced action center, which led to tighter human and robot collaboration. HMH is poised to realize approximately $10 million in annualized benefit by the end of March 2022. These are just a few examples of customers expanding automation across multiple departments and increasingly buying multiple parts of our automation platform leveraging our expanded cloud deployment offering and adding test automation and process discovery capabilities. This is what a world-class land and expand model looks like in practice and how it has contributed to our strong year-over-year growth.
Turning to revenue, profitability and cash, I will be discussing the results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. First quarter GAAP revenue increased 65% to $186.2 million and was balanced across regions. We successfully closed several large multi-year deals during the quarter, including a handful totaling $4 million in the first quarter revenue that were originally in the pipeline for second quarter. GAAP remaining performance obligations or RPO were $463.9 million, an increase of 96% year-over-year.
While growth at scale is our priority, we continue to drive operational rigor which has resulted in strong unit cost economics, positive operating income and improved free cash flow. Of course, software robots are key to UiPath growing profitably and our own automation Center of Excellence has created 300,000 hours of incremental capacity since 2019 with automations deployed enterprise wide.
Gross profit margin in the quarter was 87.6% compared to 88.8% in the prior year period. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $147 million. Investments included headcount additions across our sales force and customer success teams to meet the growing demand and engineering teams to drive future growth. GAAP operating loss of $236 million included $250.8 million of stock compensation expenses, mainly related to our recent IPO.
We delivered our second quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income of $16.1 million, compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $20.1 million, compared to negative 24.6 million in the prior year period. First quarter free cash flow reflects seasonality, including our annual bonus payout and sales commissions related to fourth quarter performance.
Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities and no debt. This includes the $692.4 million in net proceeds from our April IPO. As this is our first quarter providing guidance, let me begin by emphasizing the core principles by which we plan to run and assess the company.
We are building a generational company. The secular trends in our market are only strengthening as our prospects and customers adopt an automation first mindset, driving more use cases and deployment of more software robots.
In addition, we believe that our relative competitive positioning is only strengthening and we are only in the early stages of what is to come. From a financial perspective, this means running the business with metrics that drive the right behavior and most beneficial outcomes for our customers, partners and shareholders over the long-term.
Turning to the numbers, this afternoon's guidance reflects confidence in our market, product portfolio and competitive position. For the second quarter fiscal 2022, we expect ARR to be in the range of 702 million to $704 million. As I emphasized repeatedly, ARR is the key metric for measuring UiPath and it lays a strong foundation for the company as we scale.
We expect revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $185 million given the variability introduced by ASC 606, we do not focus the business on short-term revenue growth, which can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and dislocated from ARR and the long-term growth in the health of the business. This is evidenced by the fact that second quarter revenue is expected to grow 31% at the midpoint of guidance, while ARR is expected to grow 55%.
Last year, we closed several large multi year deals in the second quarter, which drove significant revenue contributions under 606. And we expect our non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of $35 million to $25 million as we continue to invest in the business while still driving efficient operations.
For fiscal 2022, we expect ARR to be in the range of $850 million to $855 million. Our robust pipeline of both new and expansion deals is reflected in our ARR guidance for the second quarter and full year underscoring the continued momentum in our business. Finally, we expect basic share count for the second quarter to be approximately 515 million shares outstanding.
In summary, the opportunity in front of us is enormous and growing. Our strong first quarter results and guidance reflect the growing momentum in our business and the power of our automation flywheel. We are building an innovative and enduring company and remain focused on helping our customers and partners transform how people work by unlocking human creativity through automation. This is an exciting time for UiPath. And we look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter.
We'll now take questions and I'll turn the call over to Kelsey. Great, thanks everyone for joining us. Our first question is from Keith Bachman at BMO. For Ashim, could you provide color on the impact to growth in the quarter of existing customers, those driven by net retention rate and new logos. And what you anticipate the impact of those two will be over the course of the year. Thank you. I just want to start by emphasizing the strength of our quarter $653 million of ARR and a record quarter of incremental ARR breaking $70 million and $72 million total incremental ARR. When you look at that growth, it was really founded on the fact that we're continuing to add customers at a really fast pace. So our customer count is now greater than 8500 customers that's up more than 600 sequentially, and 2400 year-over-year. Quite frankly, this has exceeded our expectations. And we're looking forward as our pipeline continues to be strong.
When you look at our net dollar retention rate, it continues to be very strong and best-in-class and expansion greater than 80% of our ARR comes from expansion versus new logos which shows you the strength of our land and expand model and the demand for automation in this massive market. We have expanded the platform with every release that you've seen, task mining, automation cloud, we look at these items in our product roadmap to continue to fuel, really both the acquisition of new logos, as well as the expansion opportunity that's in front of us. And as the base gets bigger, the ratio will shift towards expansion that's just now.
We feel really good about where ARR growth is and our guide of 47% year-over-year at the midpoint shows you that confidence as we're growing at significant scale. Great. So the next question comes from Macquarie, Fred Havemeyer. There appears to be a shift in your model towards shorter inversing durations, with some multi contracts mixed in. Could you describe how this duration shift impacts both your revenue and ARR? And also why you believe ARR is more accurate measure of your company's momentum? Ashim could you give us a couple thoughts? Yes, sure. Fred, great question. ARR and I constantly emphasize this is the foundation of our model. And the way that we look -- the way that we calculate ARR, which has been disclosed is really largely not impacted by duration at all. We view duration what is best for our customer adoption, not as a tool to make financial metrics. And so therefore, we run and manage the business in sales force to ARR.
Going to GAAP revenue, as I've stated, we're under 606, we did not think that that is a represent -- a really good representation of our business model, as it is impacted both by deployment models, as well as total contract value, which again, we look at that as really driving -- should be driven by customer choice. And as durations vary, based on customer preferences, GAAP revenue increases, based on multi-year commitment signed, all of those elements are going to create variability and noise, especially in year-over-year comparison.
ARR for us takes all that noise out and so it really gives you a representation of the true growth of our company and the true demand from our customer base. So our messaging, or emphasis, which is consistent between external and internal is around ARR. We've proven the stickiness and the strength of our product, as well as our balance sheets. So we view ARR as the primary focus of all of our sales contracts.
And while our go-to-market model has existed for the last five years, we've really been at scale for two to three years. And so we see tremendous opportunity in front of us. And we'll continue to drive our teams to ARR and look at GAAP revenue is something that we will just that we're not going to overemphasize. Great. Thanks Ashim and thanks, Fred. Bryan Bergin next from Cowen. Actually, Daniel, this one is for you. What's your response to the competitive threats at Microsoft? When do you think about the market opportunity for enterprise process automation? And how do you consider the relative mix between simple attended only automation cases and similar complex attended and unattended cases? Thank you, Kelsey. I would start by saying that we are very differentiated, first of all, in our philosophy towards automation. We have a unique platform that aims to emulate people in their work. Microsoft has built a [indiscernible] platform whose main goal is to provide new applications and analytics to the people. They are like comparing apples-to-oranges. Our approach is extremely difficult to replicate. It requires a huge experience curve that we have built over the last 15 years. Our platform is a combination of UI, API and computer vision AI that is again extremely difficult to replicate and it is our secret sauce.
Moreover, I would say that our differentiation comes from the three major directions. First of all, we have this unique end-to-end horizontal platform that is really necessary to win in this space. And this is a space that is the highest return on investment and the fastest time to value that and seen almost ever in the world of enterprise software. We are in a business where we can prove the return of investment and that was very beneficial throughout our history. We consistently have proven and we have beaten on our competitors, with our technology. If you go there and if you can show that you are able to implement in halftime, imagine the exponential return on investment that happens when you deploy a scale. And by the way, we are a technology that is proven to deploy at scale. While I would say that Microsoft's approach has not tested large scale deployments.
A second important differentiator for us is our ability to accommodate our customers, infrastructure and our flexibility of deployments, we're able to deploy in the multi-cloud, multi-platform approach and we respect our customers choices and we don't lock them in, in a particular cloud or in a particular infrastructure. And third, it's our ecosystem, which is really important in delivering automation at scale. But I would like to conclude talking about what our thought leadership, we are here to address our semantic automation platform and this is the plus word that emulates people.
And generally speaking, there is an extraordinary amount of semantic information that you can find in documents, in user interfaces, in conversations, that has been largely untapped by now. With our advance in computer vision and machine learning, we are the first company able to tap into this trove of information. And now we're newly released, the task mining is one of the first that goes deeper into this direction. Great, thank you, Daniel. We're going to open the call up to questions now. We're asking that each one of you ask just one question and one follow up and then you have others to get back into the queue. So operator, I'm going to turn it over to you right now. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Thank you for taking the questions, this is Sanjit Singh in for Keith Weiss. Congrats on really strong set of results to start off the fiscal year. I wanted to talk about the platform, Daniel you were sort of mentioning some of the highlights, including task mining, cloud, automation robots. As we think about where the automation platform is heading, where does sort of low code as a piece of the puzzle stand from your perspective, in terms of building that and building out that sort of end-to-end automation play? Is that something that you think of as a partnership opportunity? Or is that something that's a capability that you sort of bring into the platform over time? I would like to start by saying, we have been a low code, no code, automation platform since the beginning of our existence. Democratization of automation was always a pillar of our success. But indeed, we're a platform dedicated to automation. We are considered by independent reviews and by our revenue, one of the largest, if not the largest, low code, no code platform that exists today in the business.
If you look at the platform like Gentoo, it's overwhelming the amount of positive reviews there. And that was completed by our recently introduced no code application platform. I want to remind you that we believe that automation is the new layer that will sit on the top of applications. And this new layer will be the only layer that will connect end users with the automation. So we really believe in our approach. And honestly, if you're looking at a lot of low code, no code platforms, you will see that the end result in many cases, it's actually an automation. So I feel that we have a very strong angle to enter in this market and we are always going after respecting our customers choice. And it's what a very encouraging fact is that we have seen a tremendous adoption of our no code, low code application development, having like, for instance, in the first month more like the like 2000 applications created on our platform. So I truly believe that low code, no code was the quintessential aspect of our success. And we are continuing to invest here. Understood it and makes a ton of sense. And that's my follow up, I guess this question is more for Ashim. The first quarter ARR results were pretty strong on an overall basis, but even on an incremental basis. And you have talked about some of the expansion opportunities as well as the pipeline going into the rest of the year. As I look to the Q2 ARR guide, it does imply that the incremental ARR comes down year-over-year. I just want to get a better understanding of sort of what sort of -- what factors in terms of conservatism through sort of embedding in your forecast, with respect to customer expansions, or net new ARR contribution coming in the door? Yes. So our philosophy and guidance in the way that we guide is, to give -- is to provide guidance for what we have clear visibility right in front of us. I would say we continue to have strong confidence in the market that we're creating operating in a $60 billion plus TAM, we see the strength of our land and expand model. As you said, we have great momentum that is moving forward with us. Today, that is -- I'm guiding based on what I see right in front of us, we have a quarter to continue to execute. And we've got great tailwinds, especially with the release of 21.4. And the functionality it provides to continue to give high ROI to our customers. I actually have a lot of confidence right now in our -- not just our guidance for second quarter, but also for the full year. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brad Sills from Bank of America. Hi, this is Sherry on for Brad, thanks so much for taking my question and congrats again on a great quarter. I was just wondering on the cloud offering, how the adoption has been tracking and what percentage of revenue it represents. And maybe just some more color on the benefits of running UiPath on the cloud and what barriers may prevent certain organizations from adopting the cloud offering. Thank you so much. Yes, so, a great question. I will get start with the numbers and then Daniel, I'll turn it over to you in terms of the benefits that you see kind of from a technology standpoint. I would say we still see a -- from an overall standpoint, cloud is a really fast adopting part of our platform, where customers are using cloud components, not necessarily all full SaaS but including our hybrid offering. It's still a small percentage of our revenue, but with really rapid applicability and excitement from our customer base, particularly in the small to mid-market, customers and our commercial customers that we see there.
So in terms of go forward revenue, or kind of how we're thinking it really is tracking more towards what is best for our customer versus any significant impact on the financials as we see it. Just from a customer point of view and then I'll turn it to Daniel, specific capabilities, it really helps to speed especially for that commercial customer base. It speeds up their adoption cycle as they don't often have large IT infrastructure or IT organizations that are a part of that. So this gives really expands customer choice based on where they want to invest time and their individual preferences. And that to me is why you see us continuing to accelerate our new customers crossing at 8500 this quarter. Daniel can add some color in terms of additional technical features and other features that our customers. Yes. Cloud is an essential part of our strategy to get it to reduce the friction of adoption for our customers. But again, doubling down on what Ashim said, we are here to respect our customer, technology choices. Our cloud strategy is multi clouds, we build for all major clouds and our strategy is multiplatform and we are going to introduce later this year, our support for executing automations on Linux and Macs and that will increase actually, our time. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Hey, thank you and congratulations from me as well. I had a bigger picture question for maybe Daniel here. Task mining, Daniel, like, how do I have to view that to me, it almost suggests that you can, it's almost like a leading driver for future RPA because if you identify the areas, you can automate more in the task mining part, then, you can put RPA on the process money comes in, and you kind of create like a full circle in terms of your client relationship. Is that the right way to think about it? And is it as important as I think, Could you talk to that, please? Yes, I think this is absolutely correct. This is task mining, it's basically one of the initial propeller of the flywheel of automation. I'm very excited about this release. It has been like two years and more in the making. It's the most complex AI project that we at UiPath has done today. And it was the culmination of computer vision and machine learning investments over the years. It really is going to provide the acceleration of discovery of opportunities for automation, is going to multiply the number of automations on the top of the funnel, it is going to increase the stickiness of our platform. And it really addresses one of the bottleneck of large scale adoption.
But I would like to also reiterate what I said in the beginning, task mining is one of the core pillar of a semantic automation platform. Think about all this information that is available on the screen, in documents and in other human interfaces, they are largely untapped by automation and by big data today. So we're getting to understand this data. This is why we call it a semantic automation platform, we're getting to understand this data, like a human user, I think this is extremely powerful. The other piece for us is, we're really excited about -- we both have a monetization play with us. But it really also helps to drive automation, in automation opportunities and the demand for automations in our customer base. We already have a world-class net dollar retention, as you know and this further strengthens our land and expand model. And if you think about what customers are saying, our customers actually especially those who have previewed, it is not just the capability they want, it helps to see always internally go across departments, go across every single process to find every automated process, which further reinforces the $60 million plus TAM and which we're trying to win that unfair share of. Okay. The follow-up, it's funny, you kind of chimed in there, Ashim, because that was my follow-on question. Like if I look at your ARR, you kind of operating like way above like industry standards. And so the question for me was more like, do I -- how do you think about the sustainability of that number? Even if you come down a little bit, you're still going to be way ahead of the streets a bit -- I'm sorry of other vendors and other players, but like, how do you think about that number going forward? Yes. Right now what I see in front of us, I actually see a tremendous demand for automation and our platform. So if you look at two things, but we've been out there for five years plus like with a great go-to-market model. But as I said, we've really been at scale for the last two to three years. Take a company like Hackensack Meridian Health for us and I mentioned this earlier. This started in the finance department, they're able to grow across every single department. Now you put tasks mining in there, you put the other process discovery in it, you put insights into it, you bring human in the loop, all of the features that our incredible technology team has been releasing and releasing at a faster pace.
For me that fuel continues to fuel world-class expansion and every single one of our customers. So we're really confident about our ability to sustain that, not just by the features that we're producing, but the ability for our platform to handle the amount of automation and the diversity of the automation at scale for our customer base. And that really creates an exciting future for us. Thanks. The next question today is coming from Michael Turner from Wells Fargo Securities. Hey there. Thanks and congrats on reporting the first quarter here as a public company. Ashim, you've shown a quick ramp and margin over the past year. It looks like sales and marketing spend is actually still down modestly on an absolute basis versus where that number stood in Q1 of last year. Can you just talk about how you view the balance between growth and margin here? How much of that scale might prove -- might be partner enabled? And should you be spending even more here, given commentary around the inflection point in this market is happening now? Yes. So the numbers actually are masking the continued investment that we were putting in our go-to-market team. So first, let me emphasize that we are first and primarily focused on investing to capture this large and early market that is in front of us, when you look at the numbers that we've reported, there are two pieces to count when you're looking at a year-over-year comparison for sales and marketing.
The first is, we had a change in our accounting policy relative to sales compensation, which had a $10 million impact year-over-year, deferring some of that compensation expense over the life of contract versus taking that -- taking more of that upfront, when you adjust for that and you account for the fact that really COVID, the COVID adjustments of zero marketing events, travel etc, was last year, we had half of a quarter in which that was live. And then this year, we are still, we're just beginning to open up. When you account for both of those, you actually see a good dollar investment in our sales and marketing line.
We've asked, we continue to be hiring at a rapid pace to support, frankly, the large demand -- an increase in demand in our pipeline, the demand from our customers to help them on their automation journey and the demand from our partners as well. So that increase in demand means that we're going to have an investment first mindset, as we look at this, and our leadership position gives us a lot of confidence to invest.
If you look at Gartner and Forrester, that clear leadership position gives me a lot of confidence in the ROI that we're going to be able to sustain through the investments we're going to -- we've done and we will continue to do in sales and marketing. That's a super helpful color. Just a quick follow on in terms of expansion rates, you've referenced the focus there throughout the call, any commentary you can share on how that metric came in this quarter relative to historical and if not, maybe you can at least remind investors when expansion is a function of in the model here and the general cadence you see within customers? Yes. Let me define it for any anybody who's learning about our company. So net dollar retention rate essentially is the calculus that says, how much does a customer continue to expand after their initial land or their initial purchase of automation. And that is fueled by the fact that they struck many of our customers start with single points of automation and then rapidly expand across different processes, different departments and different employee bases. And so, when that creates more demand for our platform, the UiPath platform and robots and that translates to more ARR dollars for us.
When you think about our quarter, I would say we continue to be in a best-in-class expansion territory, just to give you some color around it, our expansion shows that we we've actually now have 1105 customers greater with ARR values of greater than $100,000. And you look at our customers greater than a million dollars that is [104] [ph] customers that are now spending 100 -- that are spending a million dollars more for us. So that is 126% growth for the million dollar customers and 60% growth for our $100,000 plus customers. All of that contributes to the record incremental ARR of $72 million that we've had. And what really is exciting is that our customer base, as it grows, will translate into this expansion, which gives us a lot of confidence as many companies are just beginning their automation journey, which means that our growth, we have a lot of confidence in not just the durability of it, but the stickiness and the demand from our customers. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Koenig from SMBC. Hi, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. One question really about kind of the platform and the product roadmap, and then a quick financial follow up. So your churn is very low. You have very high dollar base net retention, best-in-class. I'm curious, if we get more granular and talk about retaining and increasing engagement with individual users kind of churn on a user level. So that automation stay current and they're put to full use. Can you talk a little bit about what elements of your product roadmap play into that and are most important in realizing this goal and then I've got one financial follow up if you don't mind. I would like to say that for our platform, innovation is [indiscernible] team. We have a platform that addresses different personas, from professional developer to citizen developer to the business users, to IT, to operations, to process owners, we have the largest group of engineers that are here in the automation field. We are investing in RPA since so many years and this is a quintessential part of our platform. Our strategy is always to accelerate adoption for customers and always provide the highest return on investment, Forrester, time to value, one of the main pillar of our product strategy is to reduce the implementation time, reduce the maintenance time, because in third, it exponentially increases the return on investment.
With 21.4, we continue to listen to our customers. We have launched task mining we talked about. But we also have a launch our cloud robots offering, which is a continuation of the advance of our automation cloud. We have launched more governance to centralized cloud-based governance tools. And we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible. Our vision, our ultimate vision is business users will start designing process in an automated manner on our platform, not only automating existing manual processes. I will just add from a customer perspective, the user, we see users actually a high stickiness, we don't see licenses being migrated around to different users, because it gives -- think about a user who for one of our largest financial customers, they want to spend time doing analytics. And so if you look at Bank of America, where we have -- our products sitting with analysts to go and get data, they don't want to go back to the old way of doing things. So our platform is really making it broader. The breadth of use cases we can give allows for that grassroots demand. And that is actually one of the things that is fueling our stickiness. At an enterprise level is the stickiness at the user level itself. And so and more users are demanding it, which is fueling our expansion metrics as well. Terrific. And thanks and I'll just pivot then to the other part of incremental ARR from new logos, Ashim, you gave us some good call around that. After the Q1, anything you're seeing to change your view on incremental ARR for new logos inflecting positively this year. That's all for me. Thanks very much. Yes. I continue to feel, we continue to feel and in the discussions here, the TAM $60 million is real, every single industry, every single department, every single process, every single employee, we see that enrich in really the pipeline of what we look at. So you can see also customers migrating away from our competitors and to us. And that is not just necessarily just about the strength of our individual components. But that is the strength of our entire platform.
If you look at Verizon, they've expanded with us in terms of a customer base, but that is fueling interest across so many other companies that are now coming and giving us that inquiry to come in. So we actually feel really strongly about the pipeline and the validation of our market as well as the execution of our sales team and the investment that we've made with our inside sales teams. Now having inside sales teams, in really core centers in both the U.S. as well as globally. I have a lot of positivity in terms of the continued execution and trajectory on not just expansion but new logos as well. Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the IPO and the quarter obviously. I had a question for Daniel, when you think about the that ‘aha’ moment and customers have, because I think treatment because one of the things that really stood out to me was such high ROI and customers go all in on UiPath. I guess from your perspective, what is that ‘aha’ moment, when a customer goes all in? Are there things that you're specifically doing -- lessons learned that they can help accelerate that learning? Well, I've seen, really customers having multiple ‘aha’ moments. The first one is, when you see the first time robot running and I've seen people in operations doing this for many years, say, wow, I don't have to do this, again. And that has helped us lead our initial length. But in terms of expanding, I think the ‘aha’ moment is about realization, this technology is truly horizontal, it doesn't depend on the particular application. And it reuses the existing workflows, this is a key aspect of our technology, it produces a huge return on investment, because it really uses the manual existing workflow that customers have invested tons of money into building it. And this is all based around the operations. So this ‘aha’ moment led to a strategic sea level sponsorship of enterprise wide automation.
And the first one of this magnitude, I've seen starting with 2017, for instance, SMBC, one of our major, one of our biggest customers have started a big initiative, top level, going toward the entire bank and they have achieved return of investment in the tune of half a million dollars. And we are seeing more and more customers thinking enterprise automation scale, they want. Applied Materials, it's another customer, I remember a great discussion with their CFO and the Head of Operations saying, Daniel, I know that we are late to automate, but we want to go all the way. We want to build the completely automated finance department. And they did it. That's super helpful. And just maybe just one more on the competitive side. If somebody asked earlier about Microsoft, the one that I always get and I'm sort of curious on your perspective is, the platform vendors, the ServiceNow, the Salesforces of the world is they implement additional native RPA or low code, no code capabilities, how does that impact the market versus, more of a -- sort of a player like yourself that can play across multiple clouds, the hyperscalers, or platform vendors. I think by its nature, automation, is more of an agnostic horizontal type of technology, a particular application vendor will build automation that most importantly addresses the needs they see on their platform. And they naturally will be less focused on other platforms. We being independent are really paying the same level of attention to major business application platforms. This is actually what our customers are requiring from us, many customers are really afraid of vendor locking and this is an additional investment that will basically completely capture within a business platform. When you actually elevate your processes above the business applications, you can achieve much better flexibility in adopting cloud in migrating from one version of the platform to the other.
And this is what our customers really are demanding. Our 8500 customers that we have are a testament we have more than 65% of Fortune 500 customers, and this is a constant theme. Automation is agnostic to the business application platform. Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Daniel for any further or closing comments. Thank you. Before we conclude, I like to highlight a good friend and valuable board member, Tom Mendoza, who has decided to retire from the Board. Tom joined us almost four years ago and it has been an absolute honor to work with a person of such energy and humble character. I really thank him for his time with us.
I also want to thank the UiPath team for their hard work and dedication to our customers, and our mission of unlocking human potential through automation. We live our values of being humble, bold, immerse, and fast everyday and I'm very grateful for all that they do. We look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast, you may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

Before I turn the call over to Daniel, I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website. Finally, we would like to invite you to attend FORWARD IV, our annual user conference. We will be holding this event in-person in Las Vegas on October 4 through 6. To register, please go to the homepage of our Investor Relations website for further information.
Now, I would like to hand the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Kelsey and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. The momentum in our business continued in our second fiscal quarter as ARR increased 60% year-over-year to $726.5 million driven by record net new ARR of $73.9 million. We believe we have a long-term opportunity to drive durable growth and build a company that will transform how organizations compete, employees experience work and companies interact with their customers.
The opportunity to unlock human potential is vast and we are in the very early stages of the market ahead of us. This is why we plan to continue to invest across the business. We are hiring the best engineers to deliver market leading capabilities across our platform, increase our sales teams to reach more customers faster, investing in partner enablement to help our customers scale and growing our vibrant community ecosystem that has crossed 1.5 million members. These are just a few of the investments that we expect will further widen the competitive moat and sustain our leadership position.
Just a few short years ago, we introduced our first set of capabilities built on our unique combination of our UI automation, API management and AI-based computer vision that addressed the needs of the core RPA market. Back then, our customer count number in the hundreds. Since then, we have evolved those capabilities into an end-to-end platform that covers the full lifecycle of automation, drives fast time-to-value and ROI for customers. As of the end of the second quarter, our customer base was more than 9,100 and the number of our customers who are leveraging our platform to accelerate automation is growing quickly. We have 1,247 customers that accounted for at least $100,000 in ARR, up 59% from 785 in the second quarter of last year. This includes 118 customers at $1 million plus in ARR, up 100% from 59. These numbers demonstrate not only the significant demand for automation, but demand for automation at scale. A great example is Handelsbanken, one of the largest banks in the Nordics, which chose to work with UiPath as the strategic part of their digitalization journey. Our entire platform offering and vision was a key factor in their selection and they now have plans to utilize attended robots, AI, Process Mining and Task Mining with the goal of automating at least 75 processes within the next year.
Task Mining, which was introduced this past spring, is generating a lot of interest from both new prospects and existing customers. It is a great example of our commitment to innovation and how we can help take the friction out of adoption. With Task Mining, customers can now discover and recommend new automations with the help of AI. And when combined with Process Mining, like Handelsbanken has done in Automation Hub in the discovery pillar of our platform, we expect this will accelerate our customers’ automation journey and drive adoption across our platform.
Another example of scaling customers is Chipotle, which continues to lead digital transformation in retail and deliver on their vision for intelligent restaurants. Chipotle has been a UiPath Automation Cloud customer since 2019. And in the second quarter, they added Automation Hub and additional unattended robot to help manage and support their growing pipeline of automation opportunities. They are also investigating UiPath Task Mining for automation opportunities in their restaurants. Not only for Chipotle, but for most of our customers, flexibility of deployment is an important consideration when they are choosing an automation partner. This is where Automation Cloud plays a key role in our end-to-end strategy. It allows customers to many software robots, where they are needed, on-premise or in the cloud through a single web portal delivered as a service. And we continue to make Automation Cloud even easier to use, recently creating a tool to simplify the process of moving on-premises Orchestrator to Automation Cloud. This has helped customers such as Dentsu whose strategic vision is to elevate its employees’ potential by integrated automation and AI in both internal processes and client-facing services.
Automation Cloud has grown at an amazing pace from GA in December of 2019 to approximately 2,850 customers in 2021. In fact, more than 45% of our new customers purchased Automation Cloud in the quarter, many of them deploying in a hybrid environment. Because of our ability to support customers across deployment bundles, we can put customer requirements first every time. Even with all of this recent innovation, including the spring release of 21.4 which has more customers using it within 3 months than any release in our history, we are constantly pushing to see what we can achieve next.
One of those challenges is addressing unstructured data, which if we can accomplish it substantially broadens what customers can accomplish with automation and increases our total addressable market. Right now, we leverage AI and ML across our platform, offering more than 25 pre-built machine learning models to help customers automate more quickly. Customers of all sizes see the value in AI and ML and frequently ask us to deliver new functionality in the platform. In the second quarter, this led to the introduction of a new ML model to public preview that identifies key elements from text then classifies them to enhance automation in use cases like e-mail processing. It also led to delivery of a highly requested new feature in Document Understanding.
Document Understanding now sends validation test to end users via UiPath Action Center and also enables the auto training of ML models for continuous learning and accuracy improvements over time. This is where we see the potential for semantic automation. We believe the market will evolve from what is now rules and instructions based, frequently requiring human intervention, to software that follows the process and learns how to emulate humans. Achieving semantic automation, as we envision, it is not going to be easy, and it is going to take time, but we have always been at the forefront of automation and we are excited by the challenge. Our constant innovation results in broad recognition of our market leadership by practitioners, thought leaders and industry analysts. It also attracts partners to either join our go-to-market ecosystem or expand the depth of their relationship with us.
Investing in partners to promote their success is fundamental to our strategy. Our UiPath Services Network, or USN, was designed to provide our partners with training, certification and marketing programs. USN recognizes an elite network of service and delivery partners that work with our customers to offer skills on par with our professional services team. This quarter, both EY and Cognizant successfully completed the rigorous requirements of USN certification.
Before I turn the call over to Ashim, I want to quickly highlight Automation for Good, one of the many initiatives that demonstrate how we put our values into action. We believe in the transformative power of automation to bring out the best in people and the potential of people to bring out the best in our world. By way of example, automation has the power to help neurodiverse individuals finally retain meaningful employment. The unemployment rate for autistic individuals is staggering with over 80% of individuals unable to find work.
To help address this challenge, UiPath is supporting AutonomyWorks, a company that employs people with autism to deliver business services. You may have seen them on 60 Minutes. By creating software robots designed to make workloads manageable, this allows those with autism the opportunity to flourish in highly skilled roles and work with cutting-edge automation software. We are proud of this partnership, which is just one example of the impact of our efforts around the world. Finally, we invite you to join our user conference, FORWARD IV, next month in Las Vegas, where you will get to see all of our latest innovations firsthand. We are very excited about the upcoming introduction of 21.10, our newest platform release, which will include multi-cloud multi-platform capabilities, that we believe will further expand our addressable market and leadership position.
With that, I will turn the call over to Ashim to discuss our Q2 performance and guidance in more detail. Thank you, Daniel and thank you everyone for joining us today. Before I get started, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. I am pleased with our second quarter results, which yet again delivered meaningful growth at scale driven by our market-leading automation platform that drives fast time-to-value and tangible benefits. In fact, in an upcoming IDC whitepaper sponsored by UiPath, IDC estimates that the economic benefits driven by UiPath will grow from $7 billion worldwide in 2021 to $55 billion in 2025. Of the three benefit vectors: increased revenue, decreased expenses and increased quality, the expected benefit from revenue gains will be larger than expense cuts and job growth from increased revenue to outpace job losses from expense reduction.
We ended the second quarter with ARR of $726.5 million, up 60%. Net new ARR was $73.9 million, growing 33% driven by an increased adoption of our core product portfolio, Automation Cloud, as well as new product offerings. We have run the business and evaluate our performance based on ARR. This quarter’s strong results were driven once again by a world class land-and-expand go-to-market model. New logos included the State of New Mexico, the New York Power Authority and the University of Washington Medicine. In the second quarter, Prospect Medical started their automation journey with broad platform adoption, including test suite and insights. Accuity, a LexisNexis Risk Solutions company, selected UiPath Automation Cloud and plans to utilize Automation Hub as well as Task Mining among other products to standup a citizen developer program.
On the expand side, our second quarter dollar-based net retention rate of 144% continues to be best-in-class as customers expand platform adoption, add users and deploy more software robots. And even with these strong expansion metrics, the opportunity for our installed base to grow remains significant as we estimate that we have only captured 3% to 5% of their potential automation spend. Another way to look at this expansion dynamic is ARR lifetime value, or ARR LTV and the purchasing frequency of our largest customers. For those of you who are not on the webcast, we have added two slides to our earnings deck for reference.
First, our customers by annual cohort, these cohorts demonstrate continual year-over-year expansion, with many of them making repeat purchases within the first 12 months. This kind of growth comes from our ability to quickly create value and drive meaningful ROI for our customers. Second, our top 25 customers, where we see the momentum driven by automation at scale, this lens on our customer base shows not only the applicability of automation across a diverse set of business verticals, but also the repetitive nature of buying, which happens quarter after quarter. For example, a top 25 customer in the healthcare industry made their initial purchase to automate a handful of use cases in IT. Over time, they found additional automation opportunities across IT and shared services, ultimately setting up a Center of Excellence to service numerous federated automation teams around the globe. And while they have tied automation to an enterprise objective of saving more than $1 billion, they have also expanded their adoption by leveraging automation across subsidiaries, acquisitions and to drive top line revenue, having adopted capabilities across our platform.
And finally, ARR LTV multiples, among our top customers, ARR expansion has been strong, a theme that carries through to our top 25 customer cohort, which has grown to approximately 233x their initial investment. If we expand the ARR LTV analysis to include our top 50 customers, they have an LTV of 90x. And what I see as the most illustrative of the potential of our customer base is the LTV for our top 100 customers of 62x. All of the customers in this top 100 cohort are included in the 118 customers that account for $1 million plus in ARR.
To ensure that as many of our customers as possible see these kinds of results, we work side by side with our partners, which now number more than 4,700 to enable and accelerate adoption. Partners also expand our global reach and bring us into strategic digital transformation programs. A great example of this is Shopify, a recently acquired UiPath customer. Working with one of our big four partners, Shopify selected our automation platform to enable them to deliver an even better experience to their users. As always, we also look at ways to innovate. And in the second quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with Deloitte to invest in their Smart Factory at Wichita State. This joint ecosystem play is focused on creating the factory of the future and integrating industry-leading capabilities like UiPath to redefine how factories operate. This will be a groundbreaking showcase of the benefits of software and physical robot collaboration. We are committed to investing in our partners and helping them scale their UiPath business.
Now, turning to our second quarter, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Second quarter revenue increased 40% to $195.5 million compared to $139.4 million in the prior year period. Looking at our pipeline, which is strong across geographies, we see the opportunity to move customers to deal structures with annual ramping, which we expect will lower our overall discounts. This structure creates better ROI for our customers, long-term engagement opportunities for our partners and will yield better overall margins for UiPath. It is also positive for ARR growth, which is our most important metric, but it can create short-term revenue variability due to the timing of license delivery and GAAP revenue recognition.
The durability of our long-term growth can be seen in remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which were $519.9 million in the second quarter, an increase of 80% year-over-year. Gross profit margin in the quarter was 86% compared to 90% in the prior year period. Software gross margin of 94% was offset by services gross margin of negative 65%. While we continue to run the services business to be approximately cash flow neutral, we expect the timing of revenue recognition as well as investment in customer adoption through partner enablement to create fluctuations in service gross margin over time.
Operating expenses for the second quarter totaled $161 million. We continue to invest in headcount across our sales force and customer success teams as well as engineering. GAAP operating loss of $97.8 million included $92.6 million of stock-based compensation expense related to our equity program. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 million compared to a loss of $7.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was negative $3.5 million compared to a positive $28.1 million in the prior year period as we continue to invest in the business. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Turning to our financial outlook, guidance reflects our confidence in our market leadership, differentiated technology and focused execution. For the third quarter fiscal 2022, we expect ARR to be in the range of $796 million to $798 million. As I have emphasized repeatedly, ARR is the key metric for measuring UiPath, and it lays a strong foundation for the company as we scale. We expect revenues to be in the range of $207 million to $209 million. As a reminder, given the variability introduced by ASC 606, we do not focus the business on short-term revenue growth, which can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and dislocated from ARR and the long-term growth and health of the business. And we expect non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $15 million as we continue to invest in the business while still driving efficient operations. For fiscal 2022, we expect ARR to be in the range of $876 million to $881 million, an increase from prior guidance of $850 million to $855 million provided on our fiscal first quarter 2022 earnings call.
Before I conclude, I’d like to provide a few incremental modeling points. First, we expect sales and marketing spend to increase in the back half of the year. This includes expenses related to our third quarter user conference, FORWARD, as we start to return to some of our pre-COVID marketing activities. Second, our guidance includes an assumption that there will be a return to office when possible. We continue to monitor the impact of the Delta variant on our teams worldwide and are actively supporting employees and their families where needed. And finally, we expect basic share count for the third quarter to be approximately 531 million shares outstanding.
In summary, the team delivered a strong second quarter, reflecting our market leadership and focus on execution. Looking ahead, we have a very strong pipeline, and we expect to continue our momentum in the second half of the year. In the near-term, we are excited to host our user conference FORWARD IV. We invite you to come and speak with our executive team, customers and partners, which include global tech sponsors, AWS and Microsoft, as well as Diamond sponsors, Accenture, CGI, Cognizant, Deloitte and PwC. This significant partner presence underscores their strong support for UiPath and the industry’s largest dedicated automation event. We hope to see you there.
We will now take questions. And I will turn over the call to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now live. Thank you and congrats from me on a great quarter. One question on the demand signals you are seeing. You obviously delivered really well throughout the pandemic, but now that we’re coming out, what do you see in terms of customer appetite to accelerate even further the digital transformation do more around your RPA offering, Process Mining offering, etcetera? So how do you see this demand? Is it going to be stable for you or would you kind of think this could accelerate even further? Thank you. Thank you for the question. We always said that COVID was net neutral for us. We’ve seen some business industries accelerating, where some deceleration in other industries. As we are getting, hopefully, in the last phase of COVID, we see solid demand in – for our technology, for our platform. We are seeing quite a solid pipeline for the second part of the year. And our extended line of products like Process Mining and Task Mining are starting to show really good traction with our customers. Maybe, Ashim, you want to add something? No. I concur. I look at the long-term demand signals that we see. Daniel talked about the strength of our pipeline. We love our competitive position. The awareness in the market around our platform is higher than ever, as you can see from a lot of the industry reports that have also come out. So we actually feel very positive about the long-term demand coming out of COVID. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Thank you guys for taking the question and congrats on the very nice quarter. Ashim, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the guidance. So you raised the full year guide by about $26 million in ARR after beating Q2 by $24 million, and Q3 is about $20 million ahead of where consensus was. So I was just wondering, with that setup, are you signaling to us like consensus was a little bit too weak for Q3 and strong for Q4 and you’re trying to readjust it? Or is there a demand signal in Q4 you’re trying to make us aware, because implicitly, Q4 comes down a little bit in terms of ARR? Thank you. Keith, we can follow-up. But the way that I look at it is I really flowed through the beat from third quarter in terms of what we saw as consensus that was through there as we look out. In terms of just the overall demand signal, I would say everything that we talk about is from a macro trends, we still see in line for the year, which is a continued healthy best-in-class dollar-based net retention rate, a really steady execution on new logos. In terms of the specific guidance, really, as I look out to third and fourth quarter, I continue to guide based on what I see right in front of me, and our teams are continuing to execute in terms of driving the demand, driving the expansion in the field. And I feel like we’re set up to continue to execute well in the second half. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Yes. Thank you very much. I’ll add my congrats. So, Ashim, you had commented on seeing an opportunity to move customers, I think you said to contracts with annual ramping, but I’m not sure if I assimilated that correctly or heard that correctly. Could you just walk us through how those contracts are structured and maybe how quickly the mix might change? Any kind of – any way we might play that through and roll that forward into our revenue forecast? Yes, sure. So when I talk about an annual ramping contract, one of the things that is really positive for us is digital transformation is a long-term trend. And what has happened with the strength of UiPath’s platform is automation is a staple for the long-term requirements for customers to transform the way they work in digital transformation. So what that means is instead of buying simple annual contracts, what we see a larger demand for is getting larger term commitments from some of our customers. But the way they look at that is instead of buying 10,000 robots today, they may buy 1,000 robots today, 5,000 next year 10,000 in year 3. And those – the license deliveries would happen into those years as we go down. And so, one of the things that we look at is that we like that because that is better ROI for our customers and I – when we think about the impact on financial metrics, two things. One is remember we – and I repeat this, we really drive our company to ARR. From an ARR perspective, there is no impact that is there. Based on the way the contracts are structured, if license delivery happens in the out years, then that does have – that creates variability in revenue because we only can recognize the revenue upon delivery of the license. And so that is kind of the way that I think about it from a modeling perspective on revenue. But again, I stress ARR really, there is no impact, and that’s how we drive the business. Thanks. The next question today is coming from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Yes. Thanks, Daniel, Ashim and Kelsey for taking my question and congrats on the $1 million-plus deal productivity. I really likes seeing that. My question just relates to all the partner activity, there is been lots of press releases from you and your partners in terms of working together. And I think you said you’re up to 4,700 now. It’s a two-part question in terms of, are they more helpful, this emerging partner ecosystem with landing customers, or more of the strategic expansion? And where are you with the productivity curve of these partners? Thank you. We are very proud of growing our partner network. We’ve been able to grow to more than 4,700 partners, up from 4,400 last quarter. And the partner network is quite a big focus. It’s a central piece of our growing strategy. It’s both for bringing new logos, but also quite a bit in expanding into our existing customers. And then just to add on is in terms of the productivity curve, we see a lot of customers investing. So that is why you see a lot of the USN press releases that we have out there, E&Y, PwC, Cognizant, these just underscore the commitment of our customer – of our partners to come up the productivity curve. At the same time, relative to the importance that this is going to play for our customers, we look at this as a tremendous opportunity that we will continue to invest in. And we invest in that directly with our partners as well as with our organizations to help enable our partners come up the curve and ensure the right service quality to our customers who are really counting on this to meet their ROI needs. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Thanks very much and congrats on the strong ARR numbers. Daniel, can you just talk about – actually, it follows up on Terry’s question around partners. But are the partners getting trained up on the full portfolio? I guess are they starting just with sort of the more basic automation and then moving into Process Mining? It seemed to me that having your partners fully equipped, understanding Process Mining, the cloud automation technologies could help accelerate customer adoption of that. I guess, how influential are they in terms of customers taking on the whole platform versus maybe just the starting automation points? Thanks. Great question. We are looking always to train our partners in the full array of components of our platform. And especially, we are seeing really growth interest in the Task Mining technology that was catching up quite well with our customers. And we aim to really make all of them capable of delivering this to the entire network of customers that we are having. I believe that understanding the entire platform as a whole is central to how we want to scale up our big customers. This is why we basically invested in all the pillars of delivering automation. You cannot just – if we start only with the core, what traditionally was used to be called RPA, there is just a certain number where you can get into really automating most of the manual repetitive tasks. But bringing all the pieces together, it’s what increases the velocity of widespread adoption within our enterprise customers. Thanks. Our next question is coming from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live. Hey there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Certainly, appreciate it and its clear the focus on ARR, given the moving pieces. I wanted to hopefully just focus on the net new number there as well. The ARR growth has been pretty consistent at 60%. That net new number has bounced around a bit more in the past few quarters. Just wondering if there is anything you can add to help us smooth those trends. And maybe if there is any impact on the uptick Automation Cloud is having there or anywhere else in the model would be helpful as well? Thank you. Look, I look at our incremental ARR numbers, the net new ARR that we’ve been posting, we’re very pleased with it. It reflects the investment. It reflects both the strong dollar base – the impact of the strong dollar-based net retention rate as well as the steady execution of new logos. We continue to invest in our sales force. So as we continue to bring up our sales team and ramp up additional reps, which we’ve been doing, I feel very good about the overall trajectory to fulfill the pipeline that we have in front of us, which has grown and is very strong. In terms of Automation Cloud, I look at cloud overall, and I think, remember that the majority of what we do is in hybrid, meaning they are run at – so from a revenue standpoint, from a demand standpoint, while it’s a differentiator we will win the deal, it doesn’t really impact the difference of ARR, right? It’s more of an impact on revenue. And then when you think about just the cloud metrics, Automation Cloud has grown to approximately 2,850 customers since its launching in December 2019. Overall, the feedback from our customers is great. They love the investment in the road map, so they have choice. And they have different deployment options, which is a real strength and competitive differentiator for us as a company. And it’s instrumental as we continue to win deals, and we continue to gain traction in the market. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho. Your line is now live. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about adoption of this attended versus unattended bots. What sort of trends are you seeing? And is there the mix vary between new deals versus extension deals? We didn’t see any major change in the adoption of attended versus unattended this quarter. We are largely seeing the businesses adopting both, which is a big strength of our platform. We are the only platform that can provide best-in-class unattended and attended robots. And we have continued to invest on this front. For instance, I am very proud that in this fall, we are going to release attended robots for Mac and for Mac users. So we are effectively expanding our total addressable market to – from the people that are using Windows machines in the office to basically people that are using Macs. And in the future, we will go to all sorts of devices. So we continue to really look to win and extend our lead in the attended space. While I think it’s clear for everyone here that in the unattended space, we’ve been a clear leader for a long time. And Siti, just one thing that I think is important to emphasize, when you look at the use cases, as you think about driving durable growth, use cases like the contact center that – sometimes we put attended with simplicity really, you need a robust attended offering to solve the complexities and drive the meaningful ROIs for our customers that is there and that’s important not just for the land, but also for the expand. As people go and take advantage of more use cases, the need for both technologies working in concert is more important than ever for our customers. Thank you. Next question today is coming from Scott Berg from Needham. Your line is now live. Hi everyone. Congrats on the good quarter and tanks for taking my questions. I guess I have one because it’s come up, I think, in every investor conversation I’ve had on you guys this quarter is, how should we think about the progression of the deployment model moving from your term model to a cloud model over time? You guys obviously highlighted some recent successes there, but it’s probably the number one question I get, considering most of the companies we all cover here do have a family of SaaS-based distribution today? Thank you. So when you think about it, I – we’ve always talked about a shift which we’ve factored into a lot of the discussions we’ve had at the IPO time of around 20% movement to the cloud. So a lot of that is already baked into how we think about the future. We are on that trajectory. I think what we see is the demand for different cloud components is there. So when I say 2,850 customers are using Automation Cloud, that doesn’t necessarily mean – that doesn’t mean they are on a full SaaS offering. That means they are on a hybrid deployment offering, which uses some components that are in the cloud and some that is on-prem. And that is not forced by UiPath. We actually respect our customers’ choices, because they have certain infrastructure requirements, certain security requirements, their own journey to the cloud that we want to be able to support rather than forcing them into our mechanism. The feedback and – the other point on the cloud is our execution has been really world-class. When you look at what our product and engineering team has done with Ted Kummert’s leadership, the feedback from the customers has been extraordinary. Customers like Chipotle, Accuity, which is a LexisNexis service company, they are starting their journey with the cloud, right. And so we like the mix that we are seeing. It’s in line with what we have talked about historically. And so far, I would say we are going to continue to execute to that trend. There is no major deviations that are worth highlighting. Right. Our next question is coming from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. I wanted to ask about StudioX. I know it’s still a little early, but can you talk about how perhaps that’s influencing expansion? And what it really means for – from a seat count perspective to be able to expand the opportunity with that offering? StudioX was for us perhaps the most successful product launch after our core RPA technology. And it effectively allowed us to go into the citizen development market and could extend quite a bit the people able to deliver our – to deliver automation on the top of our platform. Now, we continue to invest in StudioX as a major tool to foster the community of citizen developers. We are going to extend it also to be available multi-platform. So, you will expect quite a bit of investment from us in the coming few quarters. It’s – right now, we are doing really a major advance into multi-cloud and multi-platform. And we are launching Linux-based robots. We just announced yesterday the public review available. We are launching Mac support. We are going to launch early next year, the web-based StudioX that will make it even easier to adopt. But overall, we really believe that it’s important to have a suite of tools that cater to a large array of options from professional developers to citizen developers and to all business users. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is now live. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I had a follow-up question on incremental ARR from new logos. Can you just comment on the drivers there and how we should be thinking about incremental ARR from new logos within that 2022 outlook? Perhaps can you comment on average deal size you might be seeing in the pipeline as well? Thanks for the question, Bryan. Average deal size to us has been relatively constant as customers tend to land in similar ways, as we speak, even though they may land at different portions of our platform. So, we have always talked about that average land size somewhere between $15,000 and $25,000, somewhere in there. In terms of the factors that are driving new logos, one is the macro factors. We see more and more awareness that is there. And at the same time, customers who are not familiar with automation still are looking for education. I do think that we are continuing to be in the early phase of this market. So, the long-term trend in the pipeline, we feel really bullish about. In terms of just execution internally, our team has done a great job with the investment that we have made in an inside sales team, both in the Americas as well as in Europe, that is driving really good execution and really great unit cost economics in terms of the customer acquisition cost. And that for us is something that is very positive, and we are going to continue to invest in those areas as they are generating the return that we expected and continuing to drive momentum there. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Hi, great. This is Steve Enders on for Michael. I just wanted to ask a little bit around the competitive environment that you are seeing out there. It seems like there has been a lot of either M&A in the space and people moving into adjacent areas of the automation software market. But have you seen any kind of change in the landscape in the past quarter, in the past year or so? So, we all know this is a big market growing quickly, and automation is the central piece of the digital transformation. So obviously, all major players in the cloud and the business applications are in our space. We – I think the most important movement in this market was done by Salesforce that acquired a small German company. And it played out – we kind of expected this. And I think it made sense for Salesforce. And what is quite telling is that they did this small RPA company to the new suites of products. So, Salesforce is seeing a consolidation between low-code, no-code integration and automation. And this is exactly what we have told the market for a long time, and we have expanded into these areas for a long time. With this big release in the fall, you should expect really a smooth integration of our Cloud Elements acquisition that was done in the beginning of this year. So, we will make a very well-oiled machine around automation with low-code, no-code that we have introduced a year or something ago. And now we are really combining UI automation and API automation in a very good integrated package. We believe that our angle towards this consolidated platform is our angle that comes from emulating people is really the one – that is the winning angle. All these small acquisitions made me think that still the big software players don’t understand how difficult it is to build emulation software. This is our bread and butter. We have built it for a long time. And starting from this angle, we – it gives us a tremendous opportunity to extend our reach to the entire consolidated automation space. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is now live. Hi. Thank you. And a question for Ashim, now, the ARR is clearly your metric for momentum here. And I wanted to ask also about the mapping of duration and ARR as that flows through the rest of your model. Because as I am looking at this, it really looks like we are seeing less multi-year upfront deals, certainly, to your point that you are shifting more towards annual deals across the board. And between that and potentially fewer multi-year annual deals based on what I am looking at here, it looks like that’s having a number of impacts across your model in revenue as well as potentially in deferred revenue that you have in your balance sheet. So Ashim, if you could, could you potentially walk us through some of those impacts? And then to the extent that you can provide a bit of color on some of the duration mix shifts that we are seeing here in this model? Thank you. Sure. So, first thing to note is, remember, you can look at duration in two ways. There is billing duration and there is contract duration. Billing duration means typically prepaid deals that we have there, and contract duration just means the duration of the contract regardless of payments. The majority of our deals are 1 year, and we are – we continue to emphasize that, as you said, with the emphasis on ARR. That being said, our contract duration is steady. When you adjust for some of the large – some unusuals that are there, year-over-year contract duration, you do see towards a trend for us that is shorter as we put more emphasis on ARR versus history. Billings duration is down and that is because we have deemphasized prepaid deals given our cash position and our gross retention rate. So, when your gross retention rate is 98%, we don’t feel kind of compelled to trade any type of discount for long for getting the cash in the door right today. We are able to make better and better economic decisions from the position of strength. That being said, this is all going to fluctuate based on the mix of deals, and I talked about it earlier. There is an opportunity to move customers to deal structures with annual ramping, which does provide lower overall discount levels. It’s better ROI for our customers as well as they can really lock in to their automation needs that they have today and provides more predictability for themselves as well as their engagement opportunities for our partners. That shift is positive for ARR growth. But like I mentioned earlier to an earlier question, it can create short-term variability. And if there is any confusion on ramp, remember what I mean is you can buy robots of 100 per year for a 3-year deal or you can buy robots of 100, 200, 300 in a deal. And then the licenses for that additional 100 per year gets delivered in subsequent years, which is why there is – why that creates variability in terms of revenue recognition. So, I know that it’s not the simplest of subjects, but happy to address that further in follow-ups. Right. Our next question today is coming from DJ Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is now live. Hi. Thanks, guys and I will add my congrats on the quarter. You guys have talked a lot with us about the synergies between RPA and AI and ML. I am just curious, like, how do you explain this to prospective customers? And how influential would you say this in deal cycles today? I am trying to get a sense for where we are in terms of tactical deployments versus maybe more strategic adoption, if that makes sense? We have introduced recently an overarching concept that we call semantic automation and this is an umbrella that define how we are going to approach the next phase of automation that is becoming closer to how human workers perform their job. In the early phase of RPA, we were after more repetitive, completely rule-based tasks. And our robots never really understood what we were doing, what they were doing there. In this next phase, we aim to bring a lot more knowledge about the task themselves and about the data that these processes are moving from one application to the other. So, this is a natural evolution that marries the world of automation with the world of AI. AI is quintessential into reducing the gap between how robots operate and how people operate. And we are making huge investments. We are making each – you should expect from us each quarter from on incremental progress towards this overarching vision. For instance, this release, this major release in October, we will see the introduction of a technology called Forms AI, which is capable of creating nice user interface forms based strictly on the data. So, it’s making – creating for our customers even easier, it’s creating this beautiful form that allows interaction between humans and robots. And we will have incrementally more and more of this feature that really command a lot of advanced AI techniques. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Great. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the expansion activity real healthy year holding in at that 144% net retention level, wondering what is – what does it take for a customer to kind of maybe cross that threshold? Is there a tipping point where you see multiple departments, a certain number of robots when you start to really see that acceleration of expansion into some of those metrics you provided for top 25, top 50, top 100 accounts? And then how could the Task Miner help potentially accelerate that trend? Thank you so much. Well, our strategy was always to have customers accelerate their automation with the full platform. This is really the best way to quickly achieve meaningful return on investments. Our customers typically start with a handful of use cases to promote the return and expand when they realize the potential. Accelerating automation and ensuring customer success is truly a combination of technology and partners. Our technology provides a full slate automation platform that is really instrumental into the large-scale adoptions and clearly increasing the net retention rate, while our partners are instrumental into making this adoption happening at speed. And I am sure Ashim has more to add in terms of practical numbers. Yes. So, when you look at our dollar-based net retention, you are right, Brad, we are very pleased with 144%. And we are very pleased with the percentages of customers greater than $100,000, which is crossing 1,247, which is up 50%. And $1 million-plus customers are growing 100% plus, at 118 right now. When you ask about what’s the tipping point, I would say there is a couple of things. One is definitely interdepartmental buying. That’s a huge opportunity for us that we continue to see customers take advantage of. In terms of the dollar base, the reason why we really track that $100,000 mark, that really is what we start thinking about as a escape velocity, where it shows that automation is a hugely strategic part of a customer’s digital transformation journey. It has meaningful presence and investment in – by our customers. And we are very happy to see it, which drives the LTV that I talked about earlier, that’s really that escape velocity that gets you to that 62x for the top 100 in terms of expansion versus its original deal, 90x for our top 50 and 233x for our top 25. So, that’s how I think about the tipping point, primarily is use case expansion and department expansion. Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Steve Koenig from SMBC Nikko. Your line is now live. Hi gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in. I will just ask a two-parter here. First one, just to put a little bit of a finer point on an earlier question about ARR from new logos, I was wondering maybe just some color on the increment from new logos versus net retention and are you seeing that new logo contribution turnaround from last year? I think it was down a little bit in the pandemic. And then just secondly, on the product roadmap, I would be interested, Daniel, any color from you as we are seeing voice UIs and chatbots proliferate, kind of what are the opportunities for RPA here and the integration possibilities building on what you have today? Thanks very much. So, I will start with the first part. So, in terms of new logos, I think we see roughly greater than 500 new logos that get added every quarter. We have been seeing that trend steady, and we feel very good about it for some of the questions discussed earlier. Roughly, I would say $17 million of our incremental ARR comes from that new logo – the new logo acquisition. And then one thing that’s important is our gross retention rate is 98%. So, having a robust new logo without, so to speak, a leaky pod is really supports why you see such robust growth numbers. And that speaks to the strength of our position and the importance of automation in the market and why we feel so strongly about durable growth. I will pass it over to Daniel for the second part of the question. Yes, I would like to make a case here that with this release, this fork. We are clearly expanding our market. Linux robots will deliver a faster, more flexible, more efficient back-end automation while extending on the Mac computers will allow us to really present our offering to a large number of Mac users that are among our customers. That was one of the most requested feature for us. I am saying this news, to us, it’s very important to put the technology in the hands of as many customers as possible. And you mentioned, if I heard correctly, about voice AI. We believe conversational AI is going to be a clear part of any big automation platform. To us, we regard it as a suspicious of low-code no-code application development. And we – it’s clearly something that we are eyeing on our roadmap. Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Daniel for any further closing comments. I want to thank you all very much for participating in this afternoon’s call. I also want to thank the UiPath team for their hard work, our partners for their dedication, to our customers and our shareholders for your ongoing support.

Before I turn the call over to Daniel, I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
Now, I would like to hand the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to have very good momentum in our third quarter as ARR increased 58% year-over-year to $818 million driven by net new ARR of $92 million.
Our continued growth at scale is fueled by our market leading end-to-end automation platform. Automation fundamentally changes how employees experience work and businesses interact with customers and partners. I continue to hear from customers that UiPath automation platform is one of the most important technologies in their digital transformation roadmap, driving operational efficiencies, generating revenue, and creating significant competitive advantages, as Forrester put it in their predictions 2022 automation report. Automation is emerging out of the back office to become a potent enabler of new business and operating models. Companies with advanced automation programs will obliterate not merely beat the competition. Automation also presents a truly strategic solution for the kinds of challenges presented by secular trends like the global labor shortage and supply chain constraints.
For example, Hana Bank, one of the top three banks in South Korea, had the twin goal of reducing menial tasks done by employees and preparing for future labor shortages. They started by automating tasks which yielded not only cost reduction, but more efficient HR management, then moved to cross bank mega processes and have recently entered the fourth phase of deployment. All in Hana Bank has applied automation to 80 processes, an estimated saving of around 1.5 million hours per year.
Now, turning to the quarter, I am pleased with our results which reflect our constant focus on customer success. At the end of the third quarter, we had more than 9630 customers, including new logos, like Check Inc., [indiscernible], Colgate University, Loblaw Companies and Aspen Medical.
On the expansion side, we now have 1363 customers that accounted for at least 100,000 in ARR, up 52% from 899 in the prior year. This includes 135 customers at $1 million plus in ARR up 82% from 74 in the prior year. The Saudi Ministry of Tourism is a great expansion story which highlights how relevant automation is across verticals. They began their smart automation in 2020 to expedite integration and reporting on their enterprise systems platforms.
In less than one year, using both attended and unattended robots, they reduced the time needed to collect process and analyze data by 95%, from 30 minutes per record to 40 seconds. While NRG, an energy provider in the U.S. and Canada drives home, our competitive positioning. NRG has deployed over 100 automations and achieved millions in annual savings having expanded across finance, HR IT, customer operations and their contact center. They recently acquired direct energy and are in the process of migrating direct energy's automation program from a competitor to UiPath, increasing their automation count by 50%, in a matter of months.
Customer stories like these are inspiring and it was great to gather approximately 2000 automation practitioners that foreword for our first in person user conference in two years, forward strengthened relationships and resulted in new business as well as pipeline expansion. It was clear from the interaction on our show floor and attendance in breakout sessions, led by practitioners including Amazon, Chevron, Spotify, and Palo Alto Networks, that customers are enthusiastic about the power of automation and our newest platform release 2021.10, again expands our UI API and AI capabilities and extends our competitive mode with the addition of more than 100 features and enhancements. across every stage of the automation lifecycle. Updates to our new platform capabilities, like 21.10, first released in the cloud that gives our cloud customers the benefit of a continuous two-week release cadence and asks a continuous feedback cycle, which results in high-quality semi-annual releases to our entire customer base. We have great excitement around our cloud offerings, particularly with the release of 21.10. Over half of our new customers chose cloud as part of their first purchase in the third quarter and we now have more than 3250 cloud customers.
Toll Group a leader in logistics, transport and supply chain in Australia is a great customer success story. They are leveraging our automation cloud for both attended and unattended robots, as well as document understanding, AI center and test suite. To-date, they are rapidly growing automation program is freed up 170,000 hours and they are on track for savings of $1.6 million annually. To continue to offer our customers adaption optionality, we launched automation suite with 21.10.
Automation suite enables our customers to leverage the power of the full UiPath platform with the benefit of a cloud native architecture. However they choose, on-prem, public cloud were third-party hosted with the single install on Linux. 21.10 also included the introduction of Linux based software robots, a capability that is required to be a truly cloud native company. This allows our customers to achieve scalability and auto scale ability in a cost-effective manner.
Our focus on innovation continues to strengthen our lead in the automation market and has also won us recognition by some of the foremost industry analysts in our space. First, we are very pleased to have been named a leader in the inaugural IVC MarketScape Worldwide Robotic Process Automation Software 2021-2022 vendor assessment, which positions UiPath as the leader for overall technical capabilities, and the strong capitalization structure for extending our end-to-end automation platform. And we were named robotic process automation leader and star performer in the technology vendor landscape for the fifth consecutive year according to Everest Group's Robotic Process Automation Products PEAK Matrix assessment 2021. We emerged as the only star performer with also a leader in this year's assessment, which analyzes the changing dynamics of the RPA landscape and assesses 23 service providers across several key dimensions. Acknowledgments like these are important for our customers and our UiPath ecosystem, which continues to grow meaningfully.
In fact, last month, we announced an offering that enables our partners, community contributors and independent automation vendors to distribute and monetize their RPA content to our more than 100,000 existing marketplace users.
We are also making meaningful strategic investments in go-to-market partnerships, where we work together to drive customer success. The number of our partners is increasing and now have more than 4900 and our relationships are deepening. This increased focus is driving growth, particularly with global systems integrators, where we are working to become one of the Top Practices in these influential and global organizations.
We recently expanded our strategic collaboration with Accenture to help drive the adoption of enterprise-wide automation among clients, accelerate their technology transformation efforts and create new growth opportunities.
As an Uber executive said recently at Uber, it is about how we can apply technology and innovation to serve our customers partnering with UiPath and Accenture enabled us to tap into the power of both UiPath's, Intelligent Automation platform and Accenture's business and digital transformation expertise. This powerful combination has helped Uber achieve unparalleled results in its digital transformation journey to enhance internal operations productivity, quality, performance, and user experience.
In addition, we announced that our end-to-end automation platform is being incorporated into PwC perform their proprietary operational improvement methodology and management system. By embedding our platform, PwC can harness the power and scope of UiPath automation product to expedite time to value for customers engage in rapidly advancing digital transformation initiatives. Customers like Mercy, a Saint Louis based healthcare system also benefit from the expertise of our vertical partners specialists like Ametek, a healthcare data analytics and automation consulting for an UiPath diamond partner.
Mercy started their automation journey in finance and continues to scale on our platform, adding test mining and test suite this quarter while steadily deploying more automations. Today, they have hundreds of automations deployed across 84 use cases, with an estimated total benefit of 10s of millions of dollars, and additional time for nurses and doctors to provide better outcomes for their patients. This is our vision to automate mundane tasks to allow employees to make a meaningful difference. All of this is about driving customer success, which includes technical integrations that make it easier to deploy automation. And this quarter, we made several strategic announcements with major technology providers.
We partnered with CrowdStrike to provide customers a new level of security and visibility by extending endpoint security to RPA through their CrowdStrike Falcon platform. This is the first of its kind in the industry. We integrated UiPath insights with Snowflake to provide customers with faster data processing and analytic capabilities to scale their automation programs. We expanded our strategic relationship with Alteryx to include new integrations, making it easier to invoke UiPath bots in an Alteryx workflow.
Finally, we partnered with Qlik. To enable Qlik Cloud Analytics users to leverage UiPath automations to drive action and prioritize tasks in downstream applications. Connectors like this make automations that combine API integrations for high volume transactions with our comprehensive UI computer vision, easy to build the lever, govern and manage. A comprehensive automation program requires a combination of emulation, particularly for the long tail of manual processes an API integration for high volume transactions, both of which are foundational to our platform.
In summary, we had the strong Q3 and we continue to drive growth at scale. The market is very healthy, and we see considerable demand for our automation platform. I feel very good about what we have been able to accomplish across the business since our IPO and we remained focused on innovation and our customers, which we believe is key to our ongoing success.
With that, Ashim will take over to talk in more detail about our third quarter results and our fourth quarter guidance. Thank you, Daniel, and thank you everyone for joining us today.
As Daniel said, we are very pleased with our third quarter as we again delivered meaningful growth at scale. We had strong adoption across our platform, including our core product portfolio and automation cloud, as well as new product offerings, and added great new customers like Prudential, Hermes, Breakthrough Beverage Group, [indiscernible] and Sprout Mortgage.
We also helped the EPA start their RPA journey and their office of their technology solutions. At the same time, we continued to drive market leading expansion rates across our customer base. For example, Isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey has successfully automated nearly 400 processes across 42 departments in two years. This has translated to 15 million transactions handled with savings of 600,000 working hours annually.
They are also deploying UiPath process mining and AI technologies with chatbots. We are also working with companies like Seiko Holdings and Canon which I've successfully implemented RPA and are expanding use cases to enable greater automation across their organizations.
Rather than diving into the P&L, I'm going to change things up a little bit. First, I'm going to focus on the relationship between ARR and revenue. Then I'll give you some color around Q3 and provide guidance, then we will take questions.
Fiscal third quarter revenue grew 50% to $220.8 million, reflecting the strength in the business we closed the third quarter with ARR of $818.4 million of 58%, year-over-year. Net new ARR was $91.9 million up 42%. We have the highly recurring subscription business driven by a true land and expand model with customers deploying more robots, adopting more platform products, and expanding use cases as they realize the considerable value of automation.
We run the business and evaluate our performance based on ARR. In our case, ARR is defined as annualized renewal run rate, which is annualized invoice amounts per solution SKU from subscription license and maintenance obligations, assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions. In other words, ARR is invoice based and we calculate it by taking the invoice amount divided by the subscription term multiplied by 365.
We have a structured process in place to calculate and report ARR, because it is invoice based, we believe that it is the most accurate and reliable measure of our true business activity. It most closely aligns to long-term cash flow and best aligns to renewals and given our strong dollar based gross retention rate, which was 98% in the third quarter. ARR is most reflective of customer commitment, regardless of deployment model.
Revenue recognition on the other hand is based on total contract value or TCB under ASC 606 accounting. And unlike ARR, it is impacted by contract duration, deployment model and licensed delivery, which makes revenue highly variable quarter-to-quarter.
Before I move on a quick reminder. Under ASC 606 license revenue is recognized at the point in time when the customer has access to the license key, which well generally occurs in the first quarter of the contract can vary. Subscription services revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of the contract upon licensed delivery.
These next slides do a good job showing the impact that ASC 606 has on revenue. The reasons why we believe ARR is the best way to drive and measure the business and how both these metrics ultimately are connected. The first example is a one year on-prem deal. It takes the impact of duration out of the revenue equation and reinforces the trailing 12-month revenue equals ARR, which is also what we invoiced in that period.
The next example shows the impact of multi-year contracts on revenue. In this three year on-prem deal with a $6 million TCV, license revenue recognition is front loaded in the first year, which sets up a decline in revenue between year one and year two and no growth between year two and year three. In contrast, ARR is constant for the duration of the contract.
While we aren't going to focus on trailing 12-month revenue as a metric going forward. This slide does reinforce my point. Remember, annualized renewal run rate is a cumulative metric compared to revenue, which is a point in time. While there is no perfect way to bridge the two, looking at trailing 12-month revenue over a multi-year period does help normalize some of the difference. In fact, over the last eight quarters, the CAGR of 62% for ARR and 65% for trailing 12-month revenue underscores this correlation over time.
To quickly summarize, before I move on, we don't manage the business to quarterly revenue growth because of the mechanics of ASC 606. We manage the business on ARR as it more accurately reflects customer commitment period-over-period, which lays the right foundation for the company.
Before I close, I want to make a few comments on third quarter results and provide fourth quarter guidance. I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Remaining performance obligations increased 80% to $579.5 million. Total gross margin of 85% and software gross margin of 93% reflect investments in our services and products support teams, as well as increased cloud hosting costs. Third quarter operating expenses of $179 million increased 24% including ongoing investment across the business and expenses related to our user conference held in October.
Heading into the fourth quarter, guidance assumes there will be some back to the office as we continue to monitor the impact of COVID. GAAP operating loss of $116 million included $95 million of stock-based compensation expense related to our equity program. Non-GAAP operating income was $9.1 million.
Adjusted free cash flow was negative $7.7 million. Our subscription model drives considerable cash flow. While we expect to run the business to roughly cash flow neutral this year, we will continue to invest across the business including R&D, talent, sales, and customer-related activities. We also plan to make strategic investments with partners to drive further customer acceleration and success. This market is big in early stage and given the opportunity in front of us, we plan to continue to lean in to drive growth. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect ARR to be in the range of $901 million to $903 million, an increase from prior guidance of $876 million to $881 million. We expect revenue to be in the range of $281 million to $283 million. And we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million.
We expect to be profitable in the largest revenue quarter of the year, while continuing to invest meaningfully in the business. We expect basic share count for the fourth quarter to be approximately 537 million shares outstanding.
Finally, we will guide to fiscal year 2023 when we announce our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight that we expect fourth quarter to first quarter seasonality to emerge in the business in both net new ARR and revenue results.
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter results as the team's ongoing execution continues to drive meaningful growth at scale. The opportunity in front of us is enormous. We have a strong pipeline and we feel very good heading into the end of our first fiscal year as a public company. We are building a truly multi-generational company that will change how people experience work. This is what excites us and motivates the team every day. It also keeps our focus on the long-term value creation for our employees, customers, partners, and stockholders. We hope you your family and friends have a healthy and happy holiday season.
We'll now take questions, and I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator please poll for questions. Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I have one question for Ashim and maybe I get clarification question and one broader picture question for Daniel. Ashim, thank you so much for taking this through that ARA assimilation, I thought this slide was really great. It really illuminates kind of sort of why ARR is the right metric to look at. When we're thinking about net new ARR addition this quarter. A year ago, I believe he had some pulled forwards. You had certain really strong growth against a tough comp because you have pulled forward from Q4 into Q3. Was there any one-time items or any pull forwards of ARR into this quarter that we should be aware of? Or is this quarter pretty clean.
And then, on the revenue side of the equation, a good explanation of how sort of contract durations and the like, and the size of the contracts in tax revenues, any particular impacts in terms of changing contract durations, or billing durations that occurred this quarter, that might have changed, like the revenue or the billings that we should be aware of? Hey, Keith, great to hear from you. And I hope all's well. Just in terms of the first question, no, there was no significant item that was a pull forward in any which way or that was -- can be considered from other quarters. So it's a very clean quarter, on the ARR front in particular. And then, in terms of the question around duration, billing duration will continue to contract for us. And we've talked about this multiple times in terms of just our focus now with the cash in the bank, that we are going to prioritize, more one-year deals and reduce our dependency on multi-year prepaid deals from a cash flow standpoint, that trend continued in the quarter. It's just gradual, every single quarter, and we're happy actually and very deliberate in the intention on it.
With regard to contract duration, there was nothing significant that I would say is to be called out for this quarter. In particular, duration as a whole is going to be volatile, because the way that we drive the business to ARR allows for customer choice to drive and customer economics to drive the decision on contract duration, versus our internal teams pushing it. So duration moves with every single quarter, and there is no one or two deals in particular, you see just kind of a relatively normal quarter with the mix of deals, falling the way customers have driven up. Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. Question for you, Daniel. A quick question, follow up to you Ashim. Daniel. I mean, obviously, we've tracked your company for almost four years now. And while things really jumped out at us have you expanded your platform, what you call the tapestry? Obviously, we've seen a lot of consolidation partnership announced across the RPA industry process mining for the past call three to six months here. Wondering if you could help us understand your competitive landscape, how this tapestry differentiates you and how this expanded platform is helping you out with customers. Thank you for the question. In the last quarter, we have not seen any material moves in terms of the competitive landscape. And I would start by pointing to the first IDC MarketScape report that put us in a very clear leadership position. And I would quote them saying that when it comes to real enterprise automation, real scale enterprise automation, customers are choosing UiPath. And this is, of course, because we offer an end-to-end platform that is suitable from small use cases to the most complex use cases. And indeed, we have this tapestry that we believe it's what helps our customers drive adoption from the process discovery, which is becoming really driver of growth and helping the adoption to building automation for both professional developers and citizen developers to a strong analytic platform and to our engagement layer, which is basically our low code, no code app platform, which is really dedicated to automation and integration use cases.
So I would, finish my answer, saying that automation is really becoming the critical piece of accelerating digital transformation. We are the clear leader, and we continue to win deals in very large scores, because of our technology on our platform. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thank you, and congrats for me as well. Daniel, can you talk a little bit about what you see in your customer conversations around the increased need for automation just coming from the tight labor market? So, what we are hearing in our cause is that you just can't hire a lot of people just to do repeatable kind of jobs, so you can't force to automate? Is that coming through already in your customer conversations? That will be interesting. And Ashim just quickly on the dollar net retention, is there any commentary, maybe I missed it in the call, I only heard the gross retention. But any comment around how that was tracking? Thank you. This is a great point. Even yesterday, I had the face-to-face discussion with the large investment banking company. And one of the highlights was really, that they are facing almost like 40% attrition in the bank, which is really huge. So we basically talked about how can we partner in order to offer the new guys out of college, the best working environments? How can we offer them, the best technologies out there, people want to join companies that are models that put them in the driving seat that gives them the technology to help them avoid this repetitive menial tasks that make a lot of people to really quit in large masses. So I believe this is really a great opportunity for us in the coming quarters.
And one of the customers that I mentioned in during the script is Hana Bank. And really they've done already, a lot of investments in automations, because they anticipated this tight tail end market and this is their approach. And just in terms of dollar base net retention rate, Raimo, we see that there's really no material change from our last quarter. As we've talked about in the past, we will release the actual number periodically, we continue to feel very strong and confident about our execution and our customers execution. And that continued expansion rate is something we feel very, very confident and strong about as a company. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Oh, great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. And I'll echo that congratulations on a nice quarter. One of the things that struck me in the press release that you just put out today on the partnership with Accenture, and also your comments with PwC partnership is company wide deployment. When we think of UiPath, we think of that kind of rinse and repeat departmental expansion that you guys have been executing so well on. Are you seeing more company-wide deals come into the pipeline? How does that global aside channel help with that type of activity? Thank you. Well, I can say that among our customers that are over a million in ARR, for us, all of them without exceptions, are using our platform -- are using various products part of our platform. So this is not only -- it's not something marginal, this is really something that we are seeing more and more. Our growth products that are basically part of our tapestry is one of the highest growth if not, the highest growth technology within our platform. So that's definitely a growth driver for us. It's the usage of the entire platform. And then, just Brad, the other thing we see is, we do see continued momentum, I talked about our dollar base net retention rate being very strong. One of the drivers of that is cross company deals where multiple functions are finding automation. And I think that's a really important thing as a former customer to just emphasize as people continue to learn about UiPath is our platform is horizontal. So we were talking to CHROs, CEOs, customer call center leaders, CEOs across the board even CROs in terms of how they want to use automation. And our best customers are using are able to replicate what they do in one function and replicate those wins across functions, and that is really a core part of our dollar-based net retention rate and why we have conviction about the size of our TAM. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys, thanks. Perhaps another take on Keith's question, you commented that you'd see seasonality in net new ARR, I thought of is really bookings, I guess in Q1. So, I mean, the standard reason that was pretty clear since you didn't see it last year was the pull forward that more typically you would see stronger bookings in the fourth quarter from an ARR perspective? Yes, generally what we see right now is definitely momentum between second half and first half. When I look at the pipeline today, I'm encouraged between fourth quarter in terms of the emergence of the fourth quarter seasonality that we talked about. So yes, I see that seasonality as a potential here. One thing I'll just address because, just anticipating the question behind the question is related to our guidance, our guidance philosophy continues to be to guide what I see in front of us today and we'll continue to execute and drive the company, we feel very bull -- we feel very confident about not just our execution, but the dynamics of our pipeline and the response of our customers. Daniel, I don't know if you want to talk further just in terms of what you're seeing in the market around that. Yes, it's, we are very pleased with what we are seeing in front of us. We are seeing a strong Q4, it's, the demand is there, we are seeing really very engaged partners, so overall, we are very pleased with the direction where our business is going. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a question around pipeline and then just a clarification on the retention rate. New business and specifically, and the return of in-person events, the conference in Vegas, all the things that you're doing, how has that impacted the pipeline, any material change to the pipe now versus a year ago heading into for 4Q? And then maybe just a clarification, the fact that it wasn't a material change in terms of NRR, it was a pretty wide variance between NRR in Q1 of 131% and Q2 of 144%. So I just want to understand is it within that range between those two numbers, is it lower, is it higher, would be good kind of to get that? Well, the partial return to normal face to face meetings, it's a very welcome novelty for us. We made the bold decision to have our annual forward meeting in person. And I can tell you that besides an acceleration in pipeline, it's been a great acceleration in the energy of the company seeing happy customers, happy partners talking about how important this technology is for them. It's really -- it -- I think it gave us the real energy to push forward this Q3 and we're really into great stuff into the Q4. I personally have started traveling quite a bit in Europe and in the U.S., and that's -- that makes a difference way in-person we are capable of presenting and articulating our vision to large customers establishing sea level connections, and this is one of the particularity of our technology. We need an executive sponsor in order to go big enterprise wide. So the return to normal face to face is only going to help us. Now I let Ashim comment more a bit on NRR. Yes. So, Alex, just one thing I'd like to correct is, first quarter was not 131%, it was greater than 145% is the way that we talked about it in some of the questions and calls. So really when you look at where we have been, that has been relatively consistent all year and no material change. And I always like to emphasize the operational pieces, we continue to execute very strongly because the demand for automation is high within our customers, high ROIs drive a lot of interest from internal executives, we continue to see it, and it speaks to our land-and-expand model. So, first quarter was in line with what we've talked about at 145% plus, and we've materially not changed since our numbers throughout the year here. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thank you, I'll add my congrats. So Daniel, at your User Conference in Las Vegas, one of your partners was saying that this market in the past was a three-horse race and the two of the horses got broken legs. And there were so many stories of Blue Prism and automation anywhere customers migrating to UiPath, I'm just wondering if you can shed some light on whether you have a little extra tailwind from that type of activity? And then, Ashim just going back to Michael Turits' question, the comment about Q1 seasonality emerging in net new ARR. I believe consensus is already modeling that, I know we certainly have lower net new ARR in Q1. Can you just clarify if any, are you signaling that some kind of a change is needed or do you think it's kind of reflected already? Mark, indeed, we are engaging in a few replacement deals of both automation anywhere in Blue Prism, especially within large financial institution. There are territories, particularly, I would say like in the Nordics, Canada, in U.S., where they are withdrawing their presence significantly. In the same time, I would not necessarily call it like a tailwind. Our -- the untapped opportunity in this market is huge for us, where our growth is not coming from replacement of our existing competitors, but really by delighting our customers, evolving our platform, getting new customers, this is really our driver of growth. And then Mark just no -- to be very clear, no, I'm not signaling anything that is different from what I'm seeing out there in terms of the models that I've come across. I would say given our discussions on seasonality, especially last fourth quarter between 3Q, 4Q and 1Q of our -- of the past 12 months, I just think it never hurts to repeat things. And this is our first cycle as a public company crossing between years, so I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew where I stood and how the business looks at seasonality now and what we're seeing as our business matures. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital.
Please proceed with your question. Hi, yes, this is Anisha [ph] for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. Maybe double clicking on the question on demand environment, during Q2 earnings call, you noted the impact on COVID thus far as neutral. With the new Omicron variant, have you baked in any conservatism in your fiscal '22 guidance? I think it's a bit too early to tell if the new variant is having an impact were -- not on the business. We continue to say and to see that COVID is net neutral to us. It was -- COVID is a bit of a headwind to new logos and it's a tailwind to adoption across a few other industries in existing customers. When the COVID will end, we see real market opportunity for us to drive growth across all industries, all sectors. And then just in terms of our guidance, I hesitate to use the word conservatism as I talk about. As we approach these calls, I -- the guidance that we provide is based on what I see in front of us, I don't handicap it. I have not handicapped it in any way for Omni to answer that question directly. I just really look and evaluate the data that I have in my hands today and that is the basis of our guidance. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. A question for you on the sales force, I'm curious if you've seen any challenges being caused by talent tightness in the market? And are you on plan as it relates to targeted sales force additions as you begin to plan for fiscal '23? We have invested throughout this year on our sales force. We are seeing -- we are not seeing right now significant pressure on our ability to attract talent. We have great brands out there, we have a fantastic culture inside the company, our compensation is top notch, so we are really bullish in our capability of attracting talent. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Hi, thanks. This is Joe Meares on for Terry. Appreciate you taking the question. There's been a lot of press releases from you and your partners in terms of working together, and you guys spoke at length earlier in the call about the Accenture and PwC partnerships, I think you're up to 4,900 now. So it's the two-part question. Are these partnerships more helpful with landing new customers or for expansions? And then the second part is where do you think you are in terms of the productivity curve of your relationships with these partners so far? Thanks so much. Well, I would like to answer starting with the second question, where I think this is an extremely positive momentum that we are seeing with major GSIs. We're talking with a few of them about building significant practices in UiPath. And when I -- what I mean by significant practices is like, top five, top 10 practices for them, this is truly important. In relation to the first question, we are seeing they're helping us in both adoption with existing customers and getting net new logos. Of course, we are seeing that our top 20 partners more helpful in expansion with the existing customers and the long tail of partners are a bit more helpful in getting net new logos, but overall, they are helpful on both fronts. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Yes, many thanks. Daniel, I wanted to revisit with you on the competitive landscape. Could you speak specifically to Microsoft and how you see Microsoft as a competitor both now and over the course of the next year or two? And the dynamics that I was thinking about in terms of UiPath as a pure-play vendor with cross functionality in many different application areas versus Microsoft more of a Microsoft centric versus -- but Microsoft has pretty deep reach, you mentioned a few times that you're trying to get access to senior level management. And so just hoping you could speak broadly about Microsoft and some of the underlying trends as you see them unfolding over the next year or so? Many thanks. Speaking about the current situation, as I said before, IDC has underscored very well where we are. In terms of real enterprise traction, UiPath is really the only tangible choice for enterprises that want to go from small to complex across different divisions that want a really high level of penetration. Our own data, if we take into account the deals where Microsoft is participating versus the deals where Microsoft is not participating, we are not seeing material changes in our winning rate. So right now currently, I can say Microsoft has -- doesn't have a meaningful impact on our ability to win customers. What is going to happen in the next couple of years, first of all, I would like to make a case that Microsoft is focused with their RPA mostly on citizen developer and personal productivity. This is a small part of our overall TAM. So I don't see that in the coming years, Microsoft investment and competing with us will materially derail us from our growth trajectory that we are seeing and we are building right now. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Yes, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Daniel, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thought process on verticalization, not of the product, but of your go-to-market efforts, meaning as you start to talk to companies about going deeper with automation, I would think having an understanding of those industries at a greater level of depth would be helpful in terms of maybe accelerating those conversations. I realized that's hopefully what your partners are aiding you with. But I was curious how much of that you think UiPath should take on when you think about your next steps in go-to-market, maybe not next year, but over the next few years? Thanks. Well, one of the best business decision that we made a couple of years ago was to create our industry expertise group. So we hired across a few verticals, people that really are capable of speaking customer language and articulate how technology is helping them. We have built also value engineering that is industry-specific. So that was instrumental for us in lending key deals across financial services, healthcare, and public sector especially. We continue to invest across particularly these three industries. And we are also investing in partners specialized in these areas. So it's really a good point. But at this time, we don't see a need to verticalize our products specific to industries, but for -- from a go-to-market perspective, we are looking very closely into how can we better address customers, particularly across these three industries that I mentioned. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Just had a question about investments into next year, I saw it seems like OpEx decelerated a little bit more this quarter. How are you thinking about hiring into next year, both from R&D and sales and marketing, and any kind of specific areas you're prioritizing, should we expect similar pace of growth or any ramp-up as you try to address this large market opportunity ahead of you? Thanks. I can tell you our strategy for hiring into R&D was higher like there is no tomorrow. We are joking internally saying we don't have a budget for R&D. And I'm really happy to tell you that despite the pressure in the market, Q3 was one of our best quarter for hiring into R&D. Now on a more general terms, I continue to say we really invest across the company, particularly in go-to-market where we invest in field, we invest in velocity, and velocity is one of our best performing things out there in terms of sales productivity, we invest in customer success to continue our great adoption story, and we invest in partners, because we are ultimately a partner-led business. So it's, at this point, we are not seeing reasons to be very concerned about our hiring ability. As I said before, we have a great brand out there, we have a great comp, our position, we are the leader in the market that changes how people live and work, people believe in our destiny, and ultimately, we have also an amazing internal culture as it's really expressed by our own employees. And then just in terms of the metrics really quick, when we say that OpEx is decelerating, I want to remind everybody that when you look at sales and marketing expense for the quarter, it would seem from a reported basis that were down 13%, please remember that there was an accounting change related to commissions, and on a pro forma basis when you adjust for that, we are actually up 42% year-over-year, which speaks to the investments that Daniel was talking about. And R&D is up 46%, we continue to build out in support, et cetera. Right now, while we're committed to long-term operating margins that we've talked about of 20% plus, our priority right now is investment.
And we've talked about being roughly cash flow neutral, we're not afraid to go a little plus or minus against that. We look at the TAM as early, we look at our market position as leading, and so with that confidence, we will continue to invest in both our go-to-market and our R&D business to scale the company. We look at that cycle to continue through next year. And you can see that even with the investments that we've talked about within our earlier call, within the earnings call around our partner ecosystem -- partners and our ecosystem. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Hey there, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Ashim, just following on to some of the seasonality questions and comments, is there anything else you can add from a large deal perspective? Maybe just how you approach guiding for larger deals in particular, and maybe as part of that you can also just help level set and remind us what the cadence of use case or broader expansion most often looks like, is that typically an annual conversation and that's also what goes into the second half versus first half seasonal shape you're expecting or just any additional context on those you mentioned still relatively early in your public company journey, I think it's all useful context? Thank you. Yes, great, Mike, I appreciate the question. When I think about seasonality and large deals, one is the definition of large deal in our -- in -- given our accounting is different between revenue and incremental ARR. So as I think about large deals from an incremental ARR standpoint, I continue to be pleased with the pipeline and demand. We haven't fully highlighted it, but our million dollar plus customers continues to grow, and we see continued momentum in large scale customers throughout fourth quarter. The second piece of that is from a revenue standpoint, fourth quarter, we anticipate to be -- have the most deal activity in terms of there, so duration is going to be something we keep an eye on. Like I said, I really do -- we don't drive duration from a business standpoint in terms of actively from a metric standpoint that really becomes customer and economics driven.
In this environment, I would say our pipeline is dynamic even at this stage in the quarter and we'll continue to monitor that as we go through there as we close the rest of the quarter and as we really kind of enter into the final stages there. So I see good momentum, but I can't predict that really well. In terms of the -- and when I say I can't predict it really well, meaning like in terms of duration and understanding the impact of that. The last thing is in terms of the cadence, we talked about this and we could refer back to the second quarter earnings call, we talked about the life -- the contract to-date or the life to-date value of our customers, many of our customers buy quarterly, it's nothing that they wait for their annual cycle to grow.
Really, what defines when a customer is -- expands is when they start seeing those bursts of ROI that come. For many of our customers that actually can come two to three months out and then continue to come as they go across departments. And for other of our customers, depending on their implementation journey, they may be using some of the early pieces of their purchases and then wait for their renewal. So more often than not, we see multiple buying patterns, but multiple points in the year of when customers buy, and that again speaks to the strength of our land-and-expand model that's there. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ashim Gupta for closing remarks. Just one thing I -- this is Ashim, just before I turn it over to Daniel to close, we've got a lot of questions coming in around RPO. So just for everyone to hear, I want to just state the numbers clearly and so everybody can jot them down for those who had questions. Total RPO for the quarter was $579.5 million, and that's up 80% year-over-year. Current RPO was $359.3 million, and that is up 69% year-over-year. So I just wanted to clarify that. With that, I'll turn it to Daniel to close. I want to thank you all very much for participating in this afternoon's call. I also want to thank the UiPath team for their hard work, our partners for their dedication to our customers and our shareholders for your ongoing support. We hope you have a happy and healthy holiday season and look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter. Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kelsey Turcotte of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to review UiPath's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 financial results, which we announced in our earnings press release issued after the close of the market today. On the call with me are Daniel Dines, UiPath Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Ashim Gupta, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with prepared remarks followed by a Q&A session. Our earnings press release and financial supplemental are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com.

Forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. Before I turn the call over to Daniel, I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call. Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to discuss. So I'm going to break my comments down into sections. I'll start with a quick review of our business, followed by some highlights from the fourth quarter, including new products and partnerships. I'll finish with guidance and give you some details about what our new Chief Business Officer. Before any of that, I want to acknowledge the events unfolding in Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire country, and we are deeply saddened by the crisis that has been created. For me, this is very personal. I grew up in Romania, when it was still under communist control, so I understand the freedoms the Ukrainians are fighting to protect. Amidst all of this, I'm extremely proud of the UiPath team. Among the many things we are doing, we have donated more than $1.5 million in support, and our colleagues across the region have opened their homes to refugees. We have also made our automation platform available to organizations like International Red Cross, which is using automation to manage millions of dollars of donations and we will continue to look for ways to help. Turning to the business. We delivered a very strong fiscal year 2022 marked by important milestones like our IPO, market-leading product introductions, industry analyst acknowledgment of our leadership position and meaningful growth. We have executed well, laying the foundation and attractive leaders who have experience to help us scale. We expect that by the end of fiscal 2023 we will have exceeded the $1 billion mark in ARR and revenue. Fourth quarter net new ARR grew 72% year-over-year, reaching a record $107 million. This drove total ARR to $925 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. Our continued growth at scale reflects broad-based adoption of our end-to-end automation platform and our focused execution. Automation is critical to digital transformation and to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. Our land and expand model continues to drive best-in-class dollar-based net retention of 145%. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 10,100 customers, including new logos, deliver Auburn University, ABM industry and Bechtel AG. We now have 1,493 customers that accounted for at least $100,000 in ARR on an annual basis, up 49% from the prior year. This includes 158 customers over $1 million in annual ARR, up 78%. From a product perspective, these results are driven both by customers deploying more software robots and by accelerating adoption of our broad suite of capabilities. Our end-to-end automation platform is the key differentiator for us as we help customers accelerate their automation life cycle. This includes Paychex. Paychex has saved more than 425,000 manual hours with more than 35 million bought transactions. They now have over 40 workflows in production and are expanding adoption and operationalizing intelligent automation capabilities for test mining and process mining, which help them identify opportunities to save another 40,000 hours annually. We continue to expand platform deployment options with automation cloud robots, which allows our customers to deploy unattended robots instantly without IT, resources or infrastructure. We already offer a SaaS option for almost every UiPath product, and automation cloud robot brings us even closer to a fully SaaS platform hosted in our cloud. As of the end of the fourth quarter, cloud, which includes both hybrid and SaaS deployments, has grown to more than $140 million in ARR in just over two years. We ended the quarter with more than 3,800 cloud customers with approximately 55% of our new logos selecting cloud in the quarter. This includes companies like Snowflake and Recipe Unlimited. Our focused innovation continues to strengthen our leadership in the automation market and we are excited about our upcoming platform release in May. UiPath 2022.4 delivers the next-gen automation cloud, which continues our progress towards frictionless development and faster time to value, expand automation access for all and raises the bar on security and compliance. We also continue to expand our go-to-market ecosystem. We ended the quarter with approximately 5,100 partners. Building a best-in-breed go-to-market ecosystem requires us to sell with global GSIs and automation experts, as well as enable a broad range of organizations with distribution capabilities like Ingram Micro. These collaborations include sell through like with Deloitte, which has decided to expand their UiPath usage for their internal automation journey, sell-with and sell-through during the quarter, we closed several new and expanded partnerships, including Finastra and ISID. Finastra, a UK-based global financial software company plans to bring the power of UiPath automation to financial institutions worldwide. The first phase of this partnership, we leverage Fenestrae's secure cloud platform to allow partners and automation creators to build and sell offerings to the financial market. Additionally, Fenestrae expects to include UiPath capabilities in their own offerings, which they will monetize directly with their customers. While ISID Group, a leading Japanese system integrator, is using automation to respond to Japan's tightening employment environment. Many leading Japanese companies are responding to this issue through digital technologies, and ISID is developing a unique digital human resources development service based on the UiPath platform, to offer to the wider market. As we continue to scale, we are building a go-to-market team that is driving long-term durable growth. And I want to welcome Chris Weber, who is joining us to lead that offer as Chief Business Officer, responsible for our global go-to-market strategy and execution. Chris brings over 25 years of experience to this role, having most recently helped transform sales and marketing across Microsoft as Corporate Vice President of their Corporate and SMB Commercial team. He also led Nokia's reentry into the North American market. He has scaled multiple businesses to billions of dollars and brings an entrepreneurial approach, a genuine customer first orientation and the passion for the role that automation plays in digital transformation. I would also like to thank Thomas Hansen for his partnership and contributions to UiPath over the last two years and for his assistance during this transition. Now I want to give you my thoughts on the guidance we provided this afternoon. I just returned from two weeks in Europe, where I spent time with our employees in Romania and customers across the region. We have a meaningful business in Europe that has been growing well over the last several years. This includes both employees and customers in Ukraine and in Russia, where we have paused business. I can tell you firsthand, this war is having a profound impact on the sense of physical and economic security across the continent and in the UK. We are also starting to hear customers in the US express reservations about both political uncertainty and rising interest rates. As we start the fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to guide assuming the uncertainty we are seeing in the first quarter will continue. It also takes into account our decision to transition our go-to-market leader, which can create short-term disruption. Our financial model is powerful, and we believe there is considerable opportunity to continue to drive durable growth and improve profitability as we scale the business. In summary, we had a strong close to our first year as a public company. I've said it before, and I truly believe it: we are building a multigenerational company that will change how employees experience, work and unlock human potential. Looking ahead, fiscal 2023 digital transformation is accelerating and UiPath is at the forefront of that evolution. With that, Ashim will take over to talk in more detail about our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 guidance. Thank you, Daniel. I want to echo your thanks to Thomas and welcome Chris to the team. Before I get started, please note that unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year-over-year. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped off a milestone year and continues to demonstrate our strong execution and market leadership. We ended the fourth quarter with total ARR of $925.3 million, up 59%, driven by record net new ARR of $106.9 million, which grew 72% and exceeded the $100 million mark for the first time. Full year net new ARR totaled $344.8 million, an increase of 51%. Our results were driven by broad-based demand across our platform and strong performance across geographies. Our dollar-based net retention rate of 145% for the quarter and gross retention rate of 98% continue to underscore the stickiness of our platform. Two great examples of expansion business closed during the quarter. Wireless provider T-Mobile US, a leader in 5G, which began their automation journey with UiPath a couple of years ago. Initially, T-Mobile was focused on process automation in supply chain and finance. They have recently expanded their use of the entire UiPath platform by adopting Process and Task Mining, document understanding and Automation Cloud. Going forward, T-Mobile intends to leverage Process and Task Mining to aggressively expand their automation, freeing up team members to further focus on the customer experience, increasing process velocity, and delivering more synergy savings post-merger. And Vodacom, one of Africa's largest telecom companies by revenue and market cap. To achieve their objectives, which are also tightly linked to the customer experience, Vodacom has deployed 135 unattended software robots, which have delivered today over 1.2 million hours saved, $1.3 million in OpEx savings, and $19.5 million in revenue enablement. Their next step is to launch an organization-wide citizen development program for their more than 6,000 employees to drive discovery, scale, and unleash frontline innovation. Turning back to the numbers. Fiscal fourth quarter revenue grew 39% to $289.7 million. On a year-over-year basis, FX created an approximately 600 basis point headwind to revenue growth. For the full fiscal year, we reported revenue of $892.3 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year. Fourth quarter remaining performance obligations increased 65% to $682.8 million. This includes an approximately 800 basis points FX headwind to RPO growth. Fee RPO increased 57% to $422.2 million. Total gross margin was 88%, and software gross margin was 93%, reflecting revenue seasonality offset by ongoing investments in services and cloud hosting. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses of $213. 7 million increased 39%. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by headcount additions and we ended the year with 4,013 employees. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2023, we expect hiring to be measured given our investments in fiscal year 2022. Fourth quarter GAAP operating loss of $50.9 million included $77 million of stock-based compensation expense. Full year GAAP operating loss was $500.9 million. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $41.9 million. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $73.8 million. Fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 million. For the full fiscal year, we delivered non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of negative $21.5 million. This is in line with our stated objective of being roughly cash flow neutral for the fiscal year. And we have $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt. Let me now turn to first quarter and full year fiscal 2023 guidance, which we believe encapsulates a realistic view of what we are seeing in our business today. Our roots are in Romania and the European market, which was a major focus from the beginning and is an important part of our growth profile. Approximately 30% of our business is in Europe, and we serve customers across the eastern part of the region and in Russia. We also price in local currency, which has created FX headwinds, given the recent strengthening of the US dollar. Both have a direct impact on our growth profile and guidance. For fiscal year 2023, we have included the impact of pausing business in Russia, which is approximately a $15 million reduction in ARR, of which $5.5 million will be in the first quarter. In addition, at current FX rates, we estimated an ARR headwind of approximately $5 million to $10 million for the first quarter and approximately $20 million to $25 million for the full year fiscal 2023. For revenue, we expect an FX headwind of approximately $10 million to $15 million for the first quarter and $25 million to $30 million for the full year fiscal 2023. We have also made prudent assumptions around the profile of large deals in our pipeline, given the current environment and factored in the risks that exist with any sales leadership transition. Our 2023 pipeline is strong and growing broadly. We hear from customers their continued desire to expand their automation programs and the strategic importance of the UiPath platform to their digital transformation efforts and our differentiation from our competitors. I also want to give you insight into our operating framework. We are committed to investing in this large and growing market, while balancing growth and profitability, which we have been consistently demonstrating over the last two years. Our financial model has healthy unit cost economics and strong cash flow, and we expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to be neutral to slightly positive this year. Moving to the specifics of guidance, I want to reinforce that we run and manage the business to ARR, which is where we believe investors should be focused. For modeling, we are adding both full year revenue and full year non-GAAP operating income guidance to our quarterly cadence. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect ARR to be in the range of $960 million to $965 million. We expect revenue to be in the range of $223 million to $225 million. We expect non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $25 million. And we expect first quarter basic share count to be approximately 542 million shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect ARR to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.21 billion. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion, and we expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $0 million to $10 million. Before I close, I want to leave you with a few guidance assumptions and modeling points. First, for the fiscal year, we expect first half net new ARR to comprise approximately 35% of full year net new ARR and to grow sequentially each quarter. For revenue, we expect first half revenue to be equally split between the first and second quarter and to grow sequentially each quarter thereafter. Second, we are extremely pleased with the growth of our cloud business. While this is a net positive, we expect growth in our SaaS offerings to be an estimated 4% headwind to full year revenue growth this year. Third, we started amortizing sales compensation expenses at the beginning of fiscal year 2022. Given last fiscal year was the first full year, we amortized these expenses, we are facing a 300-basis point headwind to non-GAAP operating margins in fiscal year 2023 relative to 2022. Finally, please note that we pay our annual corporate bonus in our fourth quarter sales commissions in the first quarter, which will result in a substantial cash outflow in the first quarter. We expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to be driven by normal seasonal patterns and to be neutral to slightly positive for the fiscal year. In summary, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, and we are confident in the opportunity ahead of us and the transformational potential of automation. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks. We'll now take questions, and I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question. Thank you. Two quick questions from me and congrats on a strong end of the year. The first question is, I appreciate it's tough to come up with guidance with all the uncertainties out there. Can you talk a little bit about how you did it? Was it just -- did you kind of assume lower closure rates because you know your pipeline? So, I would assume it's a closure rate thing that drove the guidance? And then the second point is on the changes to the go-to-market model. I know we have a new leader and it's kind of maybe a little bit too early to talk about it, but would we expect like significant changes there? Thank you. Hi Raimo. Nice to hear from you. So, on the guidance, you guys know that we always guide looking at what is in front of us. And right now, we are seeing the impact of the war in Ukraine. And as you know, we have a sizable business in Europe and it's more than 30% of our business and we are seeing uncertainty in Europe. In the last month, we have all experienced some deterioration on the global macro-economical climate. And we have accounted for kind of normal distractions caused by the leadership transition. On the leadership transition, first of all, I can thank once again to Thomas for his contribution. He is a great leader, and he helped us in the last two years scale from less than $0.5 billion to what we guide today, more than $1 billion in ARR and revenue. And as for the folks that know us, we always are proactively trying to bring best talent in the company, the talent that is capable of taking us to the next stage of growth. And this is exactly the stage where we are today. And I know Chris for a while, has been in my network for a while. He's an amazing business leader that has experience of scaling businesses at this stage and beyond, is an inspirational leader. He is really well connected to our customers. And I believe that he and the rest of executive team will continue to drive this business to really solid growth. The business opportunity is here. Demand is here. We are bullish for the business for the rest of the year. We've been capable of distancing ourselves from the pack. We are the undisputed leaders in the automation. And overall, we are all seeing really good -- great business prospects. Ashim, you can add to this. Yes, I think, Raimo, just on guidance in terms of the assumptions that we had, half of our guidance is very quantifiable directly. So I just want to make sure we walk down the impacts. So with Russia, it is quantifiable that we have a $15 million impact on Russia. We mentioned in the script that $5.5 million of that $15 million is literally just from the appropriate accounting of the businesses that are there. And then the balance is just from the fact that Daniel has made the decision to -- for now to take a pause with our Russia business. The second piece of it is FX. So FX has between $20 million and $25 million impact for us. We rolled forward our guidance to current FX rates. And that both includes our sizable business in Europe with the euro weakening, but also with Japan, where just even in the last 30 days, you've seen a significant movement with the yen. The remaining balance that we see there is we look at our pipeline, and we have a very strong pipeline, as Daniel mentioned. There's a number of large deals, which we're excited about. We've won those deals in the sense of they're not being baked off by competition. But given the macro climate, there's just uncertainty around that. And we've quantified that and incorporated that into our guidance to date, which is the balance after you subtract out the 15 for Russia and the 20 to 25 for FX. Okay. Make sense. Thank you. Next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Thank you, guys for taking the question. And a very nice quarter in Q4. Maybe sort of tailing on Raimo's question, so obviously, we're trying to wrap our heads around sort of the juxtaposition of what was a really strong Q4 and seeing even on an adjusted basis, 50% growth in net new ARR. And if I'm doing my math right, the forward guide assumes that $18 million -- or sort of 18% decline in net new ARR for the full fiscal year FY 2023. If we think about sort of the operating margin side of the equation and the OpEx side of the equation, can you walk us through kind of the response on that side? You mentioned kind of slowing down hiring. But if you're expecting to sell 20% less basically net new ARR, is there more that you should be doing on that side of the equation to sort of soak up some of the slack in terms of the sales force? And how are you thinking about kind of preserving that bottom line if we are going through this period of weaker demand? Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank you for your nice words about the quarter. We believe that we had a solid year. We are really pleased with the results. Going on to the guide, again, I will reiterate that we are guiding from what is in front of us. We assume that the headwinds will continue for the rest of the year. We are looking always to balance the growth and the productivity for the company. Our business, we grow -- we are looking to drive our business to in excess of Rule of 40, taking ARR and free cash flow into account for the longer term prospect of the business. Nothing has changed in the fundamentals of the business and I will let Ashim to comment more on the margins. Yes, I mean, Keith, let me -- I also just want to start with the point on the 18% decline in net new ARR. When you actually factor in the impact of Russia and FX when you normalize for that, that really is talking about an 8% decline, which in the current environment that we talked about, we believe just kind of stays in line with our -- with the guidance philosophy that we -- the prudent guidance philosophy that we have had from the very beginning of our journey here. In terms of operating margin, I don't characterize the hiring as the slowing down, I'd characterize it as just measured given the investment that we put into the company in 2022. And we are very pleased right now with the performance of our investment. We feel confident about the size of our field force and the sales capacity to be able to really take advantage of the market, not just for 2023, but also for 2024 in the sense of we'll continue to invest for the long-term. At the same time, at our scale, we're crossing $1 billion, we believe that it is important to demonstrate and show that we can both grow as well as grow profitably. And the balance of leverage is something that is important to us and our leadership team. Got it. That’s super helpful. Thank you guys. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please state your question. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong close of the year. Just actually, my question is sort of in that context of a strong close because as you pointed out the net new ARR actually accelerated strongest quarter of the year. But if I kind of break it down into dollar-based net retention as well as just new customer growth, seemed like new customer growth was particularly strong and DBNR was high. So, I guess going to the guidance, if you can maybe sort of unpack it another way, how are you thinking about the guidance in the context of sort of new customer acquisition and the DBNR are you hearing from existing customers that they're going to be pausing forward plans, or is this more of just new customers do you think are going to be hard to acquire? Maybe just kind of break it down that way and then just one follow-up. Yes. When you look back historically at us, Phil, we're a 70 -- we've historically been between 70% and 80% expansion and 20% to 30% new logos, right? So that is -- I put that in context of the impacts that are beyond our control, which is Russia and foreign exchange. I kind of put -- I would continue to split within those two realms and then that math and that modeling, obviously, that you can do in terms of what that equates to. In terms of the other pieces of the guidance, like we talked about, we're going through a leadership transition, as well as kind of with the macro environment. We're really just looking at the prudent assumption around large deals, which, again, I think I would just assume the same split as kind of the historical expansion versus new logos. What I do want to reiterate, and Daniel can obviously comment on this further is, customers aren't talking about a pause in their automation program, as much as what we hear is really just -- they're kind of working through the environment themselves, and that just creates the uncertainty of the profile and the timing of the deals at this moment. Our customers are very excited about it, I can say personally, like, we talked about in the script around some of the customers, and Daniel can comment on T-Mobile and other areas, like, we still feel enthusiasm from our customer base, and we're investing like that. I'll turn it over to Daniel to give more color on that. Yes. It's -- we are seeing really good momentum across customers, partners. I spend a lot of time with -- on the field with our people. Demand is there. The -- we are -- I want to remind you that we are operating in a very big TAM. It's in the early innings of this industry. And we remain very bullish on our prospects. Got it. And then just in terms of sales productivity. I mean, it seems like we've seen a slight trend up in that over the course of the year. When you think of sort of -- well, first off, I wonder if you could just, comment on that sort of what has been driving some of that uptick? I mean, excluding, obviously, the impact from the amortization you talked about, but wondering if you could talk about, just, sort of, sales productivity and the trend over the course of this year. Well, sales productivity has been increased constantly over the past three years. And it's really one of the main driver of net new ARR that we want to bring in the company. We really put a lot of focus on driving sales productivity, measuring across the field. Velocity, we made great investment in our velocity team. It's performing extremely well. So it's really one of the levers that we pull hard on driving our business. Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please, state your question. Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I wanted to ask about some of the comments you made around US in North America. I think you were saying, you're being prudent on your kind of forecast backing your guidance in the region, just based on potential uncertainty. Or was that more just a pause that you're already seeing from customers in the region? Yes, Brad, like, we -- one is, I think the macro environment is just overall, on large deals. I wouldn't pin it to any specific geography. Of course, Europe is the one which is, everything is onshore to. But we've also accounted for, and we've said the leadership transition, which is out there. Again, it is nothing that we're seeing anywhere. I would like to emphasize that what we see in front of us is a healthy pipeline. We do not see pauses, we just see uncertainty, given the environment. And so, we -- with our guidance philosophy that we've had from the beginning, we do feel like being prudent is the right way to think about it. The second piece of it is the profile of the large deals. So, like in terms of just whether that be duration or size, those are things that with the environment we see customers kind of reworking their own internal budgets just across the board. Automation is still well funded. The question is just kind of what are the commitments that we have. And I think we're going to get more clarity of that through the year. And so, starting the year, we feel like this is the right way to inform our investors. Understood. Thanks, Ashim. And one more, if I may, please, just on your comments around the SaaS business providing a 4% headwind. Any color you can provide on just interest in the cloud? Are you seeing acceleration in moving RPA to the cloud? What are you hearing from customers there? And any more color you could help with understanding that impact? Thank you so much. Cloud is our first growing business at this moment. We are investing heavily into the cloud. We are very happy with the release of robots that are hosted into the cloud that will further accelerate the cloud business. And for – our entire product strategy is around cloud. I want to remind you that, we are a cloud-first company. We deliver everything in the cloud first and then we go to achieve priority on on-prem and hybrid deployments. I will let Ashim to comment more on the revenue headwinds because of the cloud transition. Yes. So, we mentioned in the script, we've crossed $140 million and change so to speak on our cloud business. So we’re really – we’re very pleased with that progress, like we’ve talked about in terms of return on investment, we're happy. And I would actually say we're even ahead and we're trending ahead in terms of cloud adoption with our customers, given the strength of the offering and the flexibility that we provide our customers. The second piece of that is, just in terms of modeling, we've assumed in -- right now that we're moving a little bit ahead of where we've historically thought in terms of where we are, and we feel very good about the quantification of the headwind that cloud gives to revenue. I do want to, again emphasize is, we do run the business to ARR. And so, the cloud is -- the ARR normalizes for that and this is one of the reasons why we started disclosing and guiding from the very beginning in terms of how that looks and has an impact on that metric. So, we're actually very happy with the numbers and the overall progress. And lastly, the margin rates have really maintained. So, we said that we've guided the cloud, we would be a greater than 80% gross margin business. Within our results and our guidance, you can see that continue. And we're happy with the execution by our product teams in maintaining our margin basis, even with the cloud adoption. Thanks Ashim and Daniel. Thanks Brad. Next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please state your question. Hey, thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong numbers coming out of Q4. And I certainly appreciate what you're describing, Ashim and Daniel in terms of guidance. I wanted to ask, are you seeing any significant changes in the competition that's appearing in your deals, or sorry -- who your customers are considering now that ServiceNow and others are more aggressively positioning themselves in RPA and more broadly, automation? We are not seeing really any increase in the competition. On the contrary, we are seeing less competitive pressure in the deals. We are -- so we can comment if you are interested on various major players that we are seeing in the business. And in terms of the -- our traditional specialized competitors, we are really seeing less and less of them. We are replacing Blue Prism and Automation anywhere in many customers. And speaking about the new entrants like Microsoft and ServiceNow, we are -- we really -- we are not seeing them that much. I can comment on both specifically, if you are interested. And then just on the numbers basis, I think it's really important. We see -- when you look at our win rates, we continue to look and analyze win rates between where Microsoft and where some of these large players are playing and where they're not. We don't see them a lot. But even when we do, our win rate has no difference compared to where they are not playing. So we're really -- the trend of continuing to feel us is the dominant player in the industry. Right now, that is continuing from the data that I see and that we see as a team. Okay. Thank you for the context. And then I'll sneak another one in here. Your ability to scale to $1 billion-plus in ARR is already a significant success, but also scaling above $1 billion in ARR and durably scaling above that can present new challenges. So I'd like to ask, did you see anything in your go-to-market organization that made you question your ability to durably drive that growth above that $1 billion in ARR scale that catalyze your sales leadership change, or is this something a little more tactical perhaps? No, we believe that the leadership change is the one that will catalyze our business at this scale. We are a business of land and expand. And I want to give you some data points that convinced me that our growth profile is going to stay in high numbers for many years to come. If we look at customers over 1 million, we have improved this number by 78% this year, up to 158 customers. If you look at customers over $100,000, we have increased that number by 50% to almost 1,500 customers. They represent a great pipeline for us to grow the business for many years to come. This year, we added 2,000 new customers to our total base of customers. So given our land-and-expand profile, our net retention rate, that is one of the best in business, we are very bullish on our growth profile. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please state your question. Hi, Daniel and the team, congrats on the strong sales in the fourth quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I want to start off with following up on the CRO addition here is, Daniel, I know you talked about some potential sales disruptions, which makes it sounds like maybe Mr. Weber will do something different in the organization. But I guess what -- I guess what are you expecting him to come in and do that might be different than what you've done before? Is there anything from his background and experiences that we should particularly look for as you make this transition? Look, I think that every time we bring a new leader in the company, the that leader has the potential to reignite the passion to improve the desire of people to bring new talent in the company, to bring a partner recognition that help us improve our business. I believe I and assume will be great partners to Chris. I want to tell you that I personally led the go-to-market before Thomas for a few quarters. So, we are really passionate about go-to-market. We are always looking at ways to improve like we talked about, sales productivity. And I believe that we will make great partners with Chris, and we will continue to improve the talent acquisition and the overall performance. Got it, helpful. And then on the SaaS transition for this year, Asim, you talked about the 4% headwind. I actually think it's great to see that you're seeing some acceleration in that opportunity since that's where most of the space likely goes over time. But how should we think about pricing of the SaaS product for what you're seeing early relative to the kind of standard term license that you sell? Is pricing -- I guess, two parts there. One, is pricing consistent, or the same, or is it different? And then two, how are you seeing customers buy in that model? Are they buying or consuming the software any differently that we should think about in terms of maybe contract structure or size? Thank you. In terms of pricing, the list pricing is very similar. It's the same. We actually have what we call universal pricing to ensure that we stay by our values of making this a customer choice versus our choice. And I think that is a big differentiation for us in the market. In terms of discount discipline, given that there is a cost of -- a higher cost of goods sold component, we obviously are putting the appropriate controls in from a discounting basis to ensure that we meet the gross margin standards that we've set for ourselves. And right now, we do not see pressure to that at all. We feel very confident about where we are relative to it. In terms of buying patterns, it's still early, right? We are very happy with the cloud acceleration. Initial signs show all the benefits of the cloud platform. Upgrades are obviously just are flowing. Features are flowing, which is good. It continues to have our customers in on the front end. And having been a customer not weighing down the COEs with that allows them to focus on building pipeline and driving automation, and we expect this to be a good supportive metric of a great and healthy expansion as we go forward and a faster ramp time in terms of customers coming on board. Like I said, it's early. We're excited about what we see, and we'll continue to report out the progress throughout this year and beyond. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Hey, this is Luke on for DJ. Thanks for taking the question. So, you gave good detail around the revenue impact of the geopolitical uncertainty in Russia and Ukraine. But maybe you could share or expand on the impact you're seeing with your employees, which is to say how much of your employee base is in Ukraine and Russia, are they working, and what's your strategy for backfilling their responsibilities? Yes, we don't have a significant presence in Ukraine and Russia. In Ukraine, we have around 30 developers, and we've already have contingency plans in the product or around the areas that they worked on. In Russia, we have a small sales team. I think it's less than 15 people. We don't have any development capabilities in Russia. And we -- since the beginning of this crisis, we really helped our people in Ukraine. We have raised more than $1.5 million. The company was matching 1:1 all the donations. We are providing homes for the Ukrainians. And we are in a good position to help in that regard, because we have a big base in Romania. We have almost 1,000 people in Romania, which has a border with Ukraine. We have to admit the -- everybody is feeling the tension. But Romania, it's a country that is part of NATO. So we don't see any potential conflict that can affect -- can disrupt us. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Next question comes from Strecker Backe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Ashim, I want to go back to Keith's question, but just in a slightly different way. As you said, hiring will be measured this year. But based on your guidance, you're still stepping up your investments back into the business. So can you help us reconcile this and dig into, if not in hiring, where else are these investments going to be going? And then, just from a high level, how should we think about the margin trajectory over the next two to three years? Thanks. Yes. Thanks for the question. One is when you're looking at our expense load of this year and kind of the increase that is incorporated into the guidance, some of that is the carryover from last year. Remember, we're going to get a full annualized expense of the employees that we've hired in the second half, which is not incorporated into that. The second is, there's a three-point impact or a 300 basis point impact of our sales commission accounting change, as a headwind that you have to normalize out of that number. And then, the other piece is, we're thankfully going into a post-COVID world. So the other expenses that we have increased is getting teams back to the office and getting our offices functioning, which we are excited about. We feel like that's going to be a real boost to our productivity levels and to our -- and to the morale of the team, as it is, just on a global basis, for the world. And then, we have marketing events. Getting back out and engaging customers, has always been a great part of our culture. And we've incorporated the necessary investments to be able to do that. When you look at all of the post-COVID expenses, that's around a 400 basis -- around 400 basis points worth of expense that we've added in as a headwind. And then lastly, like I said, we're going to continue to invest, just in a more measured way. So we are still hiring. You look at our R&D and our P&E, we have a great and growing platform. We're excited about our release. I'm sure Daniel will talk about it further, but our test automation has come out to be in a leading category. We're going to continue to invest in our platform and grow in those areas. And we are committed to expanding. Like, this is for the long term. So when you think about our margin rates long term, I would say, we've already been expanding. If you look back on a trajectory of the last three to five years, we look at that trajectory to continue. And frankly, as we accelerate scale, that being said, we are constantly going to evaluate the balance of profitability and growth. We've reiterated, we feel like we're in a large and early growing market. We're going to make investments. We're not going to be shy about it. And we're going to be good stewards of that capital and measure the right returns and have the right hurdle rates internally for it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you very much. Wondering if you could just clarify whether you have, in fact, already seen any pipeline softness or any bookings slipping specifically in Europe, or perhaps February and March actually performed well and this is kind of just an extra dose of conservatism really just in case. There are spillover effects outside of Ukraine, which might spread across Europe later this year. Just wondering if you've actually really seen anything tangible yet or not? Yes. We've seen instances. Anecdotically I can tell you that in Europe, there are companies that are looking at business continuity right now because they stopped their operations in Russia. Many governments in Europe are redirecting the funds to help refuges and we have already quite a material public business. So, there are tactical instances where customers are delaying some deals and are looking to face the realities of the world. And then just in terms of like overall guidance, I wouldn't say any extract conservatism. We continue to feel like we're consistent. We are consistent with our historical guidance philosophy. And when we look at the big deals that are in the pipeline, we feel very strong about them and we've appropriately reflected that impact both for first quarter and total year. And Ashim, when -- thank you for clarifying that. Are you sensing from customers -- when you're speaking with them, do you feel like they're sort of indiscriminately kind of pulling back on all IT categories? I mean are they sort of at that point as – or do you think within your guidance, I mean, are they reflecting to you that RPA is a category that's going to be prioritized and kind of fairly resilient through some geopolitical gyrations because I think our view is that they're trying to overcome wage inflation and labor shortages, and you've got this unbelievable value prop. I'm just kind of wondering if you have a feel whether it's kind of a broad-based pullback in IT spend potentially. Yes, I would actually just answer it more in the affirmative in the sense of -- we've got an affirmation that automation continues to be an important part of -- a cornerstone of digital transformation, that's why we see these deals remain in our pipeline. I met just actually with eight of our customers in one of our advisory boards within the financial industries. We spent an entire day today together. Use cases are expanding. They're innovating. This is something that continues to be in the C level. One metric we didn't talk about, but our $1 million-plus customers continue to expand as does our $100,000-plus customers. So, we crossed 1,493 customers greater than $100,000, that’s up 49% last year, that customer bases brought you know, in our minds automation continues to be a really strong, a really strong part of our program. Our guidance really reflects just the prudence that we feel on the large deal specifically, given the macro environment. There's nothing beyond that in our minds. Yes. Okay. Probably a very -- probably a wise thing to be doing. And I do want to echo what others have said. Is it actually a pretty spectacular finish to the year with that net new ARR number. So congrats on that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig with SMBC. Please state your question. Hi, Daniel and team, thanks for fitting me in here. I have two questions. I'll ask them both at once. So one is kind of an opportunity and one is maybe a little more of a challenge. So I'm seeing firsthand expansions at your largest customers in Q4. And when you look at what's driving your largest expansions, how do you think about the broader opportunity in the Fortune 500 type base? They're doing maybe $1 million and not $10 million. And then I'll just toss out the second question, maybe a little more of a challenge here. Stock-based comp is obviously an important part of motivating employees. Your stock price is way down. And how does that affect your ability to attract and retain talent? And also related to that, how do you think about stock-based comp going forward? Thanks very much and congrats on the great Q4. Yes. Thank you, Steve. And yes, indeed, SMBC is our largest customers. We learned a lot by deploying at SMBC, and we've seen -- it's like a North Star for us when we think in terms of adoption. Look, we -- I think the value prop stays the same in the -- that we described at IPO. There is a huge number of menial repetitive tasks out there. They are not automated yet. And our technology is the only one that can really address the long day of these tasks. And adoption is solid. Even our cloud expansion proves this is a secular trend. And we are really bullish on our prospects. We are not seeing softness in customer demand. On the contrary, this is -- from all my meetings with the field, I got energized. People are seeing it's -- the pool is really there. And then on stock-based charges, we have a -- we continue to be -- and Daniel really drives us a progressive strategy around our compensation. I think hiring numbers from last year are -- continue to show the strength and belief and the excitement in our platform and the relevancy to so many people's lives and we look at our employee base and they're excited about the prospects in front of us. The durability of our growth in the market is not -- is something that is widely believed across our entire employee base. In terms of stock-based compensation, we look at that as a percentage of sales to be able to get -- to have productivity as we go forward. We do not provide a forecast on this. And again, we're in the early stages of where we are the normal dilution that you would see in any company, we look to stay within that range, 3% to 5% at maturity. That is an area that we're -- we feel very comfortable with, and we don't see that as a sacrifice in terms of attracting the talent and building the team required to deliver the numbers that we're all committed to do. And I would like to add that over the years, we've been, I'd say, very good in managing the dilution in terms of stock-based compensation. Based on our own metrics, we are one of the best company out there. So, definitely, we have room for continue to incentivize our people if this is required. Great. Well, thanks guys. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Most all my questions have been answered, but I actually still do have some. So last two really quick ones. The partner activity is impressive. I mean you're adding thousands of partners, it seems like. But what I'm curious about is if you could share where you're seeing maybe more incremental traction or momentum, whether it's ISVs. I think Paychex might be one of those or SIs or VARs or ads? Are any of those seemingly a lot further along and really kind of lifting the ARR influencing? And then my second question, I'll just throw it out there now. Daniel, I think you talked about the uniqueness of having Linux-based automation bots. What are you seeing in the market with your Linux offering? In terms of partners, we are seeing solid growth across all the segments. But obviously, the ones that bring us the most significant business are the GSIs. We -- Accenture, for instance, it's becoming one of our largest partner. The investment that we made in the relationship is paying off. PwC, for instance, it's one of our largest customers and partners. We are driving a lot of business with them and as an anecdote, they recently announced that they are terminating their relationship with Blue Prism. So, they basically are focusing on us as their automation partner. And look, in terms of the Linux-based offering, what we have in the cards is that we are building what we call our serverless offering. That is the core component that will drive the adoption of robots hosting in our own cloud. And on a long-term basis, the Linux robots and the container-based robots will provide us with the economy of scale that is required to drive a large, completely SaaS cloud-based business And ladies and gentlemen, that ends our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. I want to thank you all very much for participating in this afternoon's call. I also want to thank the UiPath team for the hard work, our partners for their dedication to our customers, and our shareholders for your ongoing support. And I want to reiterate our support for the people of Ukraine. We look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Before I turn the call over to Daniel, I'd like to inform you we will be holding our 2022 Investor Day during our FORWARD IV user Conference on Tuesday, September 27 at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas starting at noon Pacific Time. Please save the date. Invitations with registration information will be forthcoming.
Now, I'd like to hand the call Daniel. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking the UiPath team for their hard work and their dedication to our customers during this turbulent time. I'm pleased that, first quarter results exceeded expectations. We reported ARR of $977 million, which grew 50% year-over-year.
Net new ARR was $52 million, net of a $5.5 million due to Russian sanctions. When we provided guidance in late March, we knew it would be a choppy quarter, particularly in Europe, given the ongoing geopolitical situation and macroeconomic environment.
At the same time, both prospects and existing accounts tell us that automation is a long-term solution to this kind of volatility, which leaves us very optimistic about the business long term.
This year, we expect to cross the $1 billion mark in both ARR and revenue. And as we look ahead, we have aspirations to be multiples of the size we are today, which is why we have brought together a global team that has scaled technology businesses of size, their leadership and experience built upon our current foundation and will help drive the next chapter of sustained profitable growth at UiPath. Choppy macro environments typically reveal areas that can be improved.
To that end, the team is focused on simplifying our go-to-market approach, starting with an alignment that will result in better market segmentation, higher sales productivity and best-in-class customer experience and outcomes. We will be scaling through our emerging enterprise teams, which are more cost effective while at the same time, increasing our presence with key accounts where the expansion opportunities are significant, where we haven't had enough dedicated attention.
Chris Weber, our new Chief Business Officer is already writing teams to reach higher to C-level executives and instilling even better operational rigor on deal execution, while reducing bureaucracy and organizational complexity. Our market opportunity continues to be significant as the amount of many on working organizations and need for agility is only increasing. We continue to win in the market, given the measurable return on investment we create for our customers and the breadth and depth of our platform. I have never felt more confident in the leadership team, the direction of the company and our ability to build operating leverage while continuing to win this large market.
Turning back to the quarter. We continue to see broad adoption across industries, ending April with more than 10,330 customers including new logos, Bridgestone Americas, Korea Investment Savings Bank, Datto, Udemy and Virtua. We also had great competitive wins in this quarter with new logos like Zalis and DocuSign, which selected the UiPath platform including the UiPath test suite to accelerate the time to value for new automations and UiPath Integration Service to combine the power of both UI automation and API integrations in a single workflow. We now have 1,574 customers that accounted for at least $1,000 [ph] in ARR on an annual basis. This includes 168 customers over $1 million in annual ARR.
During the quarter, a global financial services and insurance company chose us to standardize on our entire platform, while phasing out a competitor. They are implementing automation across lines of business and plan to use document understanding, AI/ML and test suite as well as scale up citizen development. They have a corporate initiative to remove $100 million in cost by 2025 and see automation as instrumental in achieving their goal. We consistently hear from customers that our end-to-end platform, focused on innovation and vision for the future of automation are important differentiators for UiPath and key to winning in the market.
In the recent Forrester RPA inquiry spotlight 2022 between February 2020 and December 2021, Forrester analyst received the most inquiries about UiPath, 2.7 times the next vendor while 72% of total conversations were focused on automation platforms. We continue to deliver on our promise to make platform deployment easier, faster and similar with the introduction of 22.4, our most recent platform release.
A few highlights include, general availability of automation cloud robots with two SaaS offerings, a VM automation cloud robot created on-demand in automation cloud, providing unattended robots and serverless automation cloud robots, a pool of robots that we run selected automation jobs on demand, expanded integration options in our integration service, controls and templates to streamline app development and new citizen developer access to AI-powered tools like Forms AI, document understanding and test capture, security and compliance upgrades that include every UiPath service now in scope for SO2, and automation cloud UiPath station, and support for Mac expansion in ready-to-go attended automation and support for long-running workflows in Linux.
During the quarter, we also announced automation cloud public sector achieved FedRAMP in-process status. FedRAMP authorization will increase our addressable market in the federal space where we already have a meaningful presence. All of these points to the considerable momentum that continues to build in our cloud business, which continues to be in hyper growth with cloud ARR more than doubling year-over-year and to provide customers even more flexibility. We recently introduced a new pricing model that allows for overall migration between On-Prem and Cloud. A great cloud customer case study is global health care exchange, which started its automation journey with automation cloud.
During this past quarter, they expanded with multiyear road map to apply automation to address more complex business problems leveraging document understanding for large-scale document conversion, AI computer vision to source images reliably from vendor websites, while rolling out a new citizen development program to accelerate internal adoption.
We also continue to expand our partner ecosystem, making automation easier as both go-to-market and technical partners help customers deploy automations quickly and realize fast time to value.
On the go-to-market side, partners like NCS are both deploying our platform internally as well as leveraging it to generate revenue and better serve their customers. Our leading technology services for in Asia Pacific, NCS expects to deploy hundreds of automations within their organization and to create a UiPath automation practice focused on the delivery of the fully automated enterprise to their customers.
From a technical perspective, we announced integrations with Adobe's document services and Adobe Acrobat Sign to help customers automate end-to-end document processes to drive productivity and scale in a secure manner. Myndshft, a leading provider of automated prior authorization and real-time medical benefits check technology to enable better patient care faster by reducing manual operational tasks and introducing significant operational efficiencies. And airSlate, a fast-growing workflow automation company to empower individuals and small businesses to create, innovate and automate to digitally transform their organizations to run faster, easier and more efficiently.
Before I turn the call over to Ashim, I'd like to welcome our new co-CEO, Rob Enslin. When I met Rob, I knew that he would be the right partner to help me lead UiPath. His roots were in development at SAP where he went on to a series of increasingly senior executive roles. Based on his ability to build on lead organizations, his operational skills and commitment to customers. Most recently as President of Google Cloud, he led the team of several thousand employees that drove considerable growth at scale. While his experience and skills are important, it's Rob's personality and his passion for the power of automation, which are a great fit for UiPath.
I'll turn the call over to Rob for a few minutes to share his perspective. Thanks, Daniel. It's exciting to be on the first of many earnings calls at UiPath. It's been just over two weeks since I formally joined, but I've been watching the company for some time. I've studied UiPath's platform, market opportunity and competitive moat. And I'm convinced that in the automation, AI and ML space, UiPath will be a leader that all companies will embrace server time.
I've also been impressed by Daniel's focus on culture, which is the intangible that can create success or undermine potential. We have the opportunity to build a company that not only delivers disruptive technology to our customers, but is also defined by how we develop and empower our employees, care for our communities and give back to our society. I've spent my early days being what you would expect, meeting the team and some of our customers and starting to form my view on where I can have the most impact. We have a powerful financial model. And at this scale, we can drive both growth and operational efficiency. I look forward to digging deeper into the business and meeting many of you over the coming months.
I will turn it back to Daniel. Thanks, Rob. I'll turn the call over to Ashim to talk in more detail about our first quarter results and provide guidance. Thank you, Daniel. I also want to welcome Rob to the team.
Before I get started, please note that unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year. We ended the first quarter with total ARR of $977.1 million, up 50%, driven by net new ARR of $51.8 million. On a year-over-year basis, FX created an approximately $5 million headwind in the quarter, and we wrote down $5.5 million in ARR as a result of Russian sanctions.
Our dollar-based net retention rate of 138% for the quarter reflects the write-down of Russia ARR. Net of the Russia impact, dollar-based net retention rate was 139%, dollar based gross retention rate was 98%. First quarter revenue grew 32% to $245.1 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX impact, which was an approximately $14 million headwind, revenue grew 39% year-over-year.
We are seeing the large deals that have been in our pipeline starting to take shape including one that we closed with the customer in the health care vertical in the first quarter, which helped to drive some of our first quarter revenue upside.
First quarter remaining performance obligations increased 46% to $675.6 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX impact, which is an approximately $47 million headwind, RPO grew 56% year-over-year. Current RPO increased 45% to $424 million. Total gross margin was 85%, reflecting first quarter revenue seasonality and investment in cloud infrastructure.
Software gross margin was 92%. We continue to invest in services and cloud hosting as we scale our cloud business. First quarter operating expenses of $219.1 million increased 49% driven in part by headcount additions and our annual employee merit cycle as we reward our top talent and focus on long-term employee retention.
First quarter GAAP operating loss of $116 million, included $101.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating loss was $10.9 million. First quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was negative $53.8 million. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we pay our annual corporate bonus and our fourth quarter sales commission in the first quarter. We continue to expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to be driven by normal seasonal patterns and to be neutral to slightly positive for the fiscal year. And we have $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Let me now turn to guidance. One of UiPath strengths is our global presence, which gives us diverse perspectives and access to talent. We price in local currency and with more than 50% of our business conducted outside North America, our results are subject to foreign exchange volatility. We recognize that macroeconomic and geopolitical issues are impacting global markets and the strengthening of the US dollar continues to create a currency headwind for our business. As we did in March, the guidance we are providing this afternoon contemplates the current operating environment and includes an FX headwind offset by growing momentum in the business.
Please note FX commentary is the incremental headwind to the numbers we discussed at the end of March. First, for fiscal second quarter 2023, we expect ARR in the range of $1.04 billion to $1.042 billion. This includes absorbing an approximately $3 million FX headwind. We expect revenue in the range of $229 million to $231 million. This includes absorbing an approximately $5 million FX headwind.
We expect non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of negative $60 million to negative $55 million. This includes absorbing an approximately $2 million incremental FX headwind. And we expect second quarter basic share count to be approximately 546 million shares outstanding.
As a result of our strong first quarter, we are absorbing incremental FX headwinds and raising our full year guide for ARR revenue and non-GAAP operating margin. For ARR, we now expect ARR in the range of $1.22 billion to $1.225 billion. This includes absorbing an FX headwind of approximately $10 million.
For revenue, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.085 billion to $1.090 billion. This includes absorbing an FX headwind of approximately $20 million. For non-GAAP operating income, we now expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. This includes absorbing an FX headwind of approximately $10 million.
In summary, our pipeline continues to strengthen as some of our large deals take shape and progress through the sales process. Crossing the $1 billion mark, we remain laser-focused on realizing the efficiency that comes with scale to drive both short and long-term operating leverage and further increase our speed, agility and customer centricity.
Looking forward, we expect this combination of top line growth and bottom line efficiency to drive positive cash flow in the second half of the year. As Kelsey mentioned, please note that we will be hosting Investor Day on September 27th in Las Vegas, followed by our FORWARD IV user conference. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks. We'll now take questions, and I will turn the call over to the operator.
Operator, please poll for questions. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Hey, thank you and congrats for me for the quarter and Rob, all the best in the new role. The question I had is, well, for all of you, probably more Ashim, is around the deals taking shape. So you remember last quarter, you were one of the first to talk about it because you kind of reported later. And that created a lot of questions amongst investors in terms of how this will play out for you this was like macro as kind of people not signing deals or people kind of need to think how they shape the deals. You kind of made a couple of comments, Ashim, about that. Now can you speak a little bit more to that one. You mentioned the one health care deal, but it's a little bit more color that you can give us there? Thank you very much and congrats again. Hey, Raimo, thank you for the question. And let me start first, and then I'll let Ashim give you more color. Look, I've been in a long trip before this earnings call Europe and Asia. And I'm talking with a lot of customers. We are seeing a renewed interest for automation and that to – we are seeing also kind of positive maturity on the big deal evolution through our pipe. But overall, the – in this macro economical and we put a lot of pressure on our customers to become more efficient. And they are turning to automation in one of the easiest way to navigate through these more key waters. Ashim, over to you. Yeah. I think – Raimo, thanks for the question. What we talked about last quarter was there was no denying the macro volatility. And we reiterated the fact that, we weren't losing deals. Automation was important. These deals existed in our pipeline. It was just a question of uncertainty as our customers were gripping with the new realities that we're hitting a new war inflation, et cetera. We're 30, 60 days later. And what we see is we see deals progressing through all the stages of our pipeline. And as Daniel said, positive maturation in terms of the way they take shape. So we – as we look and we track deals through our pipeline and we see that movement, we really feel we have more confidence or we've had moderated confidence on the conversion of those deals, and we reflected it appropriately in our guidance. Okay. It's very clear. Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Got a question here for Rob. So Rob, just as you step back and look at the business, can you just talk about maybe one of your top one or two priorities as you think about the go-to-market function? Sure. So, three weeks in, so observations, talking to customers, I reiterate what Daniel and Ashim said UiPath can play a meaningful role in these economies, and I see that happening. Now we're going to focus on digital sales. We're going to drive digital sales. We're going to get up into the key customer accounts drive further adoption, higher customer satisfaction to ensure that we actually get better returns for those customers, and we're going to expand the ecosystem and channel business. Next question, please. Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. And Rob, congrats on the new post. Daniel, I was wondering if you could just go a little bit deeper on some of the sort of sales changes you guys are making under Chris, and I'm sure Rob is going to play a big role there, just in terms of how you're also leveraging partners to try to drive the sales higher in the C-suite. And I was wondering how those two things are interplaying with each other and what you're seeing with partners that gives you confidence that, that sort of upsell or higher level sales in the C-suite is something you guys can do a lot more of going forward? Thanks. Sure. We are looking to drive some incremental changes in our go-to-market. That will focus us to be more customer-centric. And we will also put more emphasis on the emerging enterprise sector that we believe will help us get more new logos in a more efficient way. I think the new partner strategy is to focus the top GSIs more on the key accounts, while we will have the long tail of partners focusing more on the emerging enterprise sector. We believe that the strategy -- this new strategy will allow us to focus more and provide faster adoption to our key accounts. Maybe, Rob, you also have something to add. I'll just add to, I think we can be very relevant in the office of the CFO, the head of supply chain, sales leadership, marketing and HR departments. I think we together with the big GSIs, that's where we'll actually have some focus because that's where they actually have -- they -- their strength is in those departments and our solutions really add value to that. So that's where we're going to focus for the big GSIs and the systems integrated. Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And nice to see that pipeline developing better than expected. I guess, carrying on sort of that last question, the -- it sounds like there's like some sense of that sales are going. Am I reading that correctly that is this a larger than typical sales reorganization? And is there kind of execution risk that we should be aware of with Rob coming on board and sort of the changes that you're trying to put into place? I'm just trying to make sure that we ascertain sort of the level of change and the potential risk of disruption with what you guys are doing on the sales side of the equation? Well, we are at the scale right now where we have to prepare this company to grow consistently and officially into the next stage. This is why largely we brought Rob and Chris to help us execute really well on this stage. So at this point, we are looking, as I said in my previous answer, to be more customer-centric, scale our emerging enterprise teams. We are looking also to globalize on function to be capable to be more consistent across the regions. So it's a balancing act between efficiency, consistency and agility that we are trying to bring into our go-to-market. I think Rob, if you want to comment more. I think that -- Keith, I think, as Daniel said, that's exactly where our focus is. Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Hey, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Ashim, in terms of the outlook and just following up on the first question around large deals, I wanted to just focus in on what else changed versus last time. You've referenced guiding for what you're seeing most recently. So maybe if you can just expand upon any increased visibility you have now versus when you were guiding initially in March?
And then the impacts of things like cloud, large deal assumptions. And I just want to be clear, the FX headwinds that you referenced were those incremental versus what you had called attention to -- in 4Q, which you think was the $20 million to $25 million in ARR. Just want to be crisp and clear given the moving pieces here as best we can. Thank you. Yeah. No, that's great. Great question. When we sit back and we look at our guidance, we continue our guidance philosophy, we guide with what's in front of us. I think you stated that correctly. So let me start with FX as that was a theme. We – the FX is a fact that's out there as the euro and the yen continue to depreciate, and we factor that into our guidance as we've provided guidance in our current guidance that we've provided.
We talked about the large deals. We just – we monitor our pipeline very closely and of course, the top deals that are there. And we're pleased with the momentum and the movement. And I think that relates to the fact that our customers themselves are starting to get a handle in terms of navigating the environment, which takes some time to digest.
In terms of what else has changed, I would say, everything else strategically with the business remains on course. So our cloud business remain strong. We're very optimistic about the customer response and the metrics around our cloud business. And we – one of the other areas is I think we see – we continue to see opportunities for efficiencies in our company. And that's why we've also increased our operating margin targets for the year. As we look – as we see opportunities both in emerging enterprises as we talked about some of the sales realignment that Daniel referenced in the earlier comments. Yeah. And I just want to be clear. This is Kelsey. When you asked about FX, it is an incremental headwind to when we gave guidance at the fourth quarter call. And we also had some commentary on cloud that we expected it to be about – I think it was a 4% headwind as we went through the full year. And that 4% is not incremental. That's consistent with the first quarter – with what we discussed 30 days ago. Exactly. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Thank you. And I'll add my congrats. So Daniel, we've had a few software companies indicating that the month of April was softer, while the month of May showed some signs of maybe getting back to normal. I'm curious, if that aligns at all with what UiPath has experienced. And are you optimistic that Q1 could have been perhaps the trough for how we would think about the net new ARR growth year-over-year? Well, we knew that Q1 is going to be a choppy quarter, and we have guided accordingly. We were seeing throughout the quarter a positive momentum, especially on the big deals like that deal with the health care insurance company, we closed in April, for instance, just really positive news for us that gave us some tailwinds for the entire quarter. And as we are progressing into May, we are seeing a healthy pipeline creation. So we are cautiously optimistic about how the business is shaping right now. And Mark, I would just point to our guidance. I think when you look at it, we guided to – we guided between $63 million and $65 million for ARR. So I think that kind of speaks to what we see the trajectory at this moment. In terms of are we at a trough in this, we'll continue to monitor and make sure that we're executing at a high pace to be able to execute in any environment. But I think our guidance speaks to kind of like where we see the trajectory right now. Our next question is from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks very much and looks like a nice stabilization in the business. On that front, and as some of the prior questions, there were a couple of comments you made last quarter. One was about decreasing size of the deals that were in the pipeline and also some headwinds around public sector business in Europe. How have those two factors trended into this quarter? We actually were talking about the large deals and uncertainty about the size of the deals and the duration of those deals. And we -- as we've commented this quarter, those deals are taking shape. They're progressing through the pipeline. We've adjusted our guidance to kind of reflect a moderate amount of optimism in terms of the conversion of those deals, especially in the second half.
In terms of Europe and in the public sector, I -- we haven't -- to my knowledge, we didn't make any specific comments like those were examples that Dan -- we were giving about anecdotes. We continue to hear anecdotes around there is pressure in Europe that I think is just understandable given the climate and the war there. But we're pleased with the movement in our pipeline. And we're also pleased with the way our sales team is executing in this environment. Our next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for taking my question. You guys talked about the new business and pipeline. Just wondering on the dollar-based net retention rate on site, mainly from your existing customer. It's came down 145% to now 139% excluding the Russian impact and you guys talked about that on the Q4 call. But wondering any kind of color you can say on that expansion in terms of your customers buying more robots versus buying other products like automation cloud. And is this some kind of trough we'll see or there are a few more quarters in that DBNR trough? Look, I think we're pleased -- we continue to be pleased with our dollar-based net retention rate. It's still a leading metric when you look at peer companies at 138% in terms of reported. We talked about the impact of both FX and Russia, that's there.
In terms of customer behavior, we continue to feel optimistic about what we're seeing. More customers are embracing our platform. We see larger $1 million-plus customers, $1 million-plus customers continue to increase in number and the same in a $100,000-plus customer today. And that really reflects continued optimism and buy around the platform and the opportunity that our customers have to continue to automate more processes.
So overall, we're pleased with kind of where we are in terms of that. We added 12 new customers greater than $1 million, and that's nearing 170 customers now at that rate. And when you compare that year-over-year, that shows a robust growth in terms of the adoption of our platform. Our next question is from DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Congrats in the question. So I imagine time to value is a big focus in the current environment. What kind of stuff are you doing to help customers realize a quick return on the investment they're making? And how do you help them think about that during the sales process? Well, first of all, I would like to tell you that automation has become really a Board priority, C-level suite priority for many of our customers. I talk to customers in different industries, public sector, they are really turning to automation at this point. So it's a -- we are seeing really a good momentum into helping them with accelerating the adoption. Our renewed focus on our key accounts and pairing our GSIs to the key accounts will help with the adoption. I believe that, also on the emerging enterprise, we can have a big – we can accelerate in a big way the adoption and getting of net new logos. And I would like also to mention our 22.4 release with the big focus on cloud that is also removing some of the friction of adoption. So overall, we are really seeing positive signs on the accelerating the adoption within our customer base. Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I wanted to maybe double-click a little bit on the cloud, Daniel. Since you have this new release, do you see this as kind of an acceleration in that down market business lower TCO or do you see this as potentially a broader play within the large enterprise base as they kind of gradually move towards the cloud. I guess, what are you hearing from customers, both large and small with regard to kind of willingness to put RPA in the cloud? Well, I think it's both. We have a certain number of very large companies, and we mentioned them in the past that switch completely for on-prem to cloud development. But I'm very bullish right now of the opportunity on more of the mid segment. We have launched in GA in this release for the first time the hosted robots in the cloud. We call them the automation cloud robots. And that can make a line of business progressing faster with the adoption.
To a certain extent, they are independent of IT into developing an automation program. So this will – will speed up quite a bit the adoption into the mid-market. Also, I would like to mention our newly – completely newly released function that we call serverless robots that can open entire new use cases in kind of API combining RPA with API integration that previously required different vendors, different type of technology. So overall, it's – the progress in the cloud is going very well. We have a great team just spent last week in Bellevue with them, very impressive product, world-class product they build. It's really a good timing right now to address the mid-market. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess all of us who are sitting here, we're trying to figure out, kind of, I think, where the incremental confidence is stemming from? Is it the feeling that deals that were maybe previously out of the pipeline are now back into the pipeline that are large and strategic? Is that, that your – you've got a greater confidence in the close rates in general? Is it some of the initiatives that you're putting into place on from a sales change perspective that they're going to materialize maybe faster than you initially anticipated? Because now the guide for the year on a constant currency basis for net new ARR is flat, which I think is a really positive surprise to all. So I think just maybe touching on where that incremental confidence in the backdrop of we're all reading the same headlines from a macro perspective, that's at least for me, I think, something that stands out. So, Alex, good to hear your voice. I think first is we recognize the macro impact early and acknowledged it. I think that's really important to emphasize. So in some ways, we were a step ahead in terms of how we were looking at things.
In terms of our confidence, our guidance is always to guide what's in front of us. So this isn't for us, just we look at our pipeline. We've talked about the strength of our pipeline overall, and that has been consistent. We've expressed confidence in our pipeline even in first quarter. We never felt like things were coming out of the pipeline. We just felt an uncertainty of how and the timing in which they were moving through.
As we look at our pipeline today, we have several of those deals that we've seen movement on and the movement through a sales process gives us increased confidence of their conversion and what shape they are taking, and that is what we've been able to reflect in our guidance.
In addition, when you just hear the sentiment from the field, automation continues to be a priority at a macro level. Like the market continues to be and our TAM continues to be feel big. We've invested in our company in many of our areas, in many other markets. So we're also -- we feel very good about our connection with our customer to be able to continue to execute. Those are the factors that led us -- that allow us to kind of raise our guidance
And then in terms of the bottom line, that is a point of focus. So we've crossed $1 billion, and we feel like we can both grow while execute efficiency, and we reflected that in our guide as well. And I would like to add our renewed confidence in the executive team. I think Rob and Chris are leading a lot of shops to our team. We are seeing really positive response from our teams. And again, I would like to mention all the discussions we are having, not only me, but every people that I'm meeting, talking to our customers are coming reenergized by this discussion. So overall, it's a better environment than we were seeing two months ago. Our next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Hey, team. This is Connor on for Terry. Thanks for taking the question. So just for me, how is automation faring with internal budgets at customer companies. There's maybe a greater lot in funds that you're seeing to invest long-term into transformational automation in a choppy macro environment? Thanks. Just from discussions with CFOs, I could tell you, digital transformation is not going away. It's only accelerating. I think we're positioned well to take -- to be able to have our share of that digital transformation budget that is there. And with many of our customers, you could just see -- again, like our customers greater than $1 million has moved up 62% year-over-year. And our customers greater than $100,000 has crossed $1,500 and is moving 42% up year-over-year. That speaks to the fact that budgets continue to be allocated for automation. And I think in a period of labor shortage inflation, we've always felt like the secular tailwinds allow for those budgets to be allocated to us, and we see that in the strength of our pipeline right now. Our next question is from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Thank you and congratulations on the strong start to the year here. I think we've all been asking in many different ways about the macro environment. So I'll try to ask in a slightly different one. And with respect to Europe, last quarter, I think we talked about how – certainly, there's some slowness that you were seeing. And I wanted to ask, is there a way to kind of differentiate it in terms of Eastern versus Western Europe within your pipeline or within your business, or just give any context really on how both segments of Europe are performing? Well, our business in – I think, we don't disclose, first of all, on the regional level. But anecdotically, I am telling you, I'm not seeing at this point a big difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe in terms of the deal shaping. Ashim, if you want to add anything? No, I agree with you, Daniel. I think Europe is definitely the area that we've recognized and accounted for in terms of the most challenging of the environments, but no distinction between Eastern and Western besides, of course, the accounting of Russia specifically and our pause on doing business in Russia. Great. Next question, please. Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong start. I wanted to focus in on, call it, the front end of the automation journey here, process mining, task mining, task capture I mean, obviously, unique UiPath to have sort of all those front-end functions then feed a log down the automation journey. What are you hearing from customers now that you've had a couple of iterations of those solutions out you're more integrated is the sort of the full suite starting to resonate and differentiate you? Just sort of any color there would be helpful. Hey, Phil, our customers are receiving our end-to-end platform in a very positive manner. And I can tell you that our – what we call growth products internally and process mining and task mining are part of our growth products are really performing very well, growing at much faster rate than our core businesses. So – and this is one data point. Another one is this white spaces around our core automation are actually helping drive more use cases into the pipeline for automation.
So overall, we are seeing really positive adoption across the entire platform. And in particular, on – we made some solid progress on the process mining technology. We are releasing it in the cloud. It's much more scalable. We are releasing a lot more connectors. So our – we are trying to address the needs of most of our customers with what we are having in the process discovery pillar. Our next question is from Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the start to the year. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the pipeline in terms of types of customers that are coming to the table, either by vertical and geography. You mentioned the big health care deal in the first quarter. Are there any patterns that you're seeing in terms of types of customers in the pipeline for the rest of the year? Thanks. Like from the very beginning, automation is something that's relevant to every single vertical. Of course, our presence in the financial, in the banking financial and insurance sector in health care, those are our two largest areas. So I think those continue to be there.
But no, we see it really across our pipeline. It's broad-based, right? We have both local governments. We have small enterprises. We have large enterprises, Fortune 500. Our pipeline continues to show strength and interest of expansion and adoption across our platform and across all the segments.
Continuing, including flanking and replacing our competitors, those are deals that we also see more and more of especially as we have our latest releases in our product and customers are seeing the breadth of our platform. So I wouldn't -- I would say no pattern that is different than history. We feel very good about it across our verticals with the major verticals and focus that I mentioned. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. I want to thank you all very much for participating in this afternoon's call. We look forward to speaking with many of you throughout the quarter. Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation . the call includes forward-looking statements about the impact of FedRAMP authorization and our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency .,1.0

Our earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. We plan to discuss non-GAAP metrics on today's call. This afternoon's call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and our financial guidance for the third fiscal quarter and fiscal year-end 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, and our other reports filed with the SEC, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 31, 2022, to be filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call. Before I turn the call over to Rob, I'd like to inform you, we plan to hold an Investor Day during our FORWARD 5 user conference on Tuesday, September 27, at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, starting at 11:45 a.m. Pacific Time with lunch that will feature round tables hosted by our executive team. Please reach out to ir@uipath.com for registration details. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance despite an increasing FX headwind and a choppy macro environment. ARR crossed the $1 billion mark, totaling $1.043 billion, an increase of 44% year-over-year driven by net new ARR of $66 million. We now serve more than 10,500 customers. Automation continues to be a central part of digital transformation for companies of all sizes and across all industries. We see this in the breadth of companies that continue to invest in UiPath, like ADT, Icertis, Mayo Clinic, Smartsheet and Take-Two Interactive, which are just a few of organizations that invested in UiPath platform in the second quarter. Our relationship with iCIMS, a leading global provider of talent acquisition software, is a good example of the power of automation. During the quarter, they expanded the UiPath deployment. And looking to the future, they plan to embed UiPath Automation Cloud robots and integration service into the iCIMS Talent Cloud to enable their customers to automate, routine tasks and business processes. Success stories like these and dozens of customers and partners I have met since I joined UiPath leave no doubt in my mind that we will be the enterprise automation provider that all organizations will embrace over time. That's because we moved automation beyond RPA to a full suite of end-to-end platform capabilities. Our PostFinance AG win says it better than we do. PostFinance, a retail financial institution in Switzerland, has been on its automation journey for three years with a competitor in RPA and another in Process Mining. Driven by a search for more efficient automation platform with a wider scope, they determined that UiPath platform is the one in the market that can fulfill all their current and future needs while significantly reducing the total cost of ownership for their automation program and helping them to achieve their strategic goal to become more efficient. Our platform not only allows customers to discover automation opportunities, but also redesign and improve previously disjointed processes, bringing them from the endless cycle of outdated approaches and unlocking the true digital transformation. Digital transformation is one of the most important secular trends, and UiPath platform is central for companies to reach their goal. Over and over, executives tell me that automation has accelerated their business, improved their customer and employee experience, increase speed to value and allow them to redeploy capital. These kinds of outcomes, our customer discussion from the RPA center of excellence, which is automating process by process to the C-suite executives, we have a holistic view of enterprise requirements. A great example of this evolution is a U.S.-based global power technology leader, a customer since 2018. They've automated over 160 processes across finance, supply chain, HR, IT and shared services, saving over $4 million. Now with the C-suite sponsorship, they have expanded their programs to the full UiPath platform, both on-premise and in the cloud, and are launching a citizen development and a tendered automation program. My takeaway from the last few months is that the market is clearly evolving, and UiPath is driving that evolution. We have a first-mover and a technological advantage. And as an automation leader, we continue to expand the value we can deliver for our customers. That being said, while we believe our business has considerable room to grow, our top line metrics have slowed and we need to evolve how we manage our business. Our go-forward priority will be to balance investing for the long-term growth while managing the business to consistently expand non-GAAP operating margin, deliver sustainable positive adjusted free cash flow in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. As we said during our IPO, over the long-term - we expect to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of greater than 20%, and our commitment to that objective has not changed. Let me be clear. I don't believe we need to sacrifice growth to achieve our profitability targets. This market is large and early stage. Our customers are committed to UiPath, and they love the outcomes we deliver. In the short term, we are strategically repositioning the Company to increase velocity, efficiency and customer centricity. This includes evaluating - elevating customer conversations, selling business outcomes and helping organizations realize the transformational benefits of automation. We have the opportunity to be the essential automation gold standard for customers delivering technology that is integral to their business strategy. To get there, we are aligning around four strategic objectives. First, investing in our platform to increase our competitive moat and delight our customers with disruptive and innovative capabilities that improve outcomes, accelerate return on investment and leverage the cloud. Second, increasing velocity and productivity. This is where we are spending the most energy and also expect the greatest return. We need to set ourselves up to take advantage of our incredible new platform releases like 2022.10, which we plan to unveil at FORWARD 5 in a few weeks. This includes branding and marketing around business outcomes that resonate with the C-suite, simplifying our sales motion to lower costs, building strategic partnerships that elevate our brand and service distribution channels and coalescing around partners that can really move the needle. Third, we are bringing together a diverse team aligned around driving UiPath to the next level. Every business that grows at our rate requires experienced leadership. We have great bench strength, having already elevated internal leaders to new roles, and a strong brand that is attracting a great pool of new talent, as you saw by today's sales leadership announcement. Finally, and equally critical, we are committed to sustain profitable growth by leveraging our scale and exercising disciplined resource allocation. Profitability is a core pillar of our go-forward strategy. While we are reducing our near-term forecast to account for a significant FX headwind, the macro environment and our internal repositioning, I am confident in our strategy, and I firmly believe, from my experience that we are on the right track to achieve our growth and profitability objectives. And I am confident in our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Daniel. Thanks, Rob. We frequently talk about our market leadership. And in July, we were positioned by Gartner as the leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for robotic process automation research report for the fourth year in a row, positioning UiPath highest for ability to execute and further for completeness of vision. We are gratified to have received this recognition. We continue to hear from our customers that the breadth of capabilities in UiPath's automation platform is why we win. UiPath is the only company that offers a complete solution, including Task and Process Mining, document understanding, Test Suite, RPA and low code deployed on-premise or in the cloud. Task and Process Mining are key to helping customers discover new opportunities for automation. And in June, we were named a Process Mining leader in the technology vendor landscape, according to the Everest Group PEAK Matrix for Process Mining Technology Vendors 2022 for the third consecutive year. And in our upcoming 2022.10 platform release, we will introduce new process mining capabilities. At the other end of the automation life cycle, Test Suite is emerging as a meaningful growth opportunity for UiPath and an important tool for customers to scale their programs resiliently. The value of Test Suite expands when customers use UiPath's test capabilities for both RPA and application testing, driving our platform adoption in a new market. Finally, we have long believed that the combination of UI plus API plus AI automation is the key to customer success and are really excited about the acquisition of Re:infer. By adding Re:infer to our platform, we can now leverage natural language processing and machine learning technology to do what we call communications mining, transforming massive amounts of unstructured data into actionable information with speed and accuracy, which customers like UBS, Paychex and Farfetch are already doing. Combining Re:infer with the breadth of our AI-powered capabilities unlocks new opportunities for our customers. We are very excited to unveil our newest innovations at FORWARD 5 where we will announce exciting functionality in our 2022.10 platform release across all elements of our platform. We hope to see many of you there. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ashim to talk in more detail about our second quarter results and provide guidance. Thank you, Daniel. Before I get started, please note that unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year. We delivered a solid second quarter in the face of increasing FX headwinds in a more measured buying environment. Customers understand the meaningful business outcomes that automation delivers and the competitive differentiation of UiPath's automation platform. In fact, two of our largest deals in the quarter were new customers making multiyear commitments to our platform, which is really nice to see. Turning to our numbers. Second quarter ARR totaled $1.043 billion, up 44%, driven by net new ARR of $66 million. On a year-over-year basis, FX created an approximately $8 million headwind to net new ARR in the quarter and a $12 million headwind to the total ARR balance. Dollar-based net retention was 132%. Normalizing for FX and excluding the impact of Russian sanctions, dollar-based net retention was 135%. Consistent with the broader macroeconomic environment, dollar-based net retention rate was meaningfully stronger in the Americas. Dollar-based gross retention was 98%. This best-in-class metric is consistent with previous quarters as customers are committed to our platform, which is driving quantifiable ROI. As of the end of the second quarter, customers accounting for at least $100,000 in ARR grew more than 30% year-over-year to 1,660, while customers contributing over $1 million in ARR grew over 60% year-over-year to 190. Revenue grew 24% to $242.2 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX impact, which was an approximately $20 million headwind, revenue grew 35% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations increased 36% to $709 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX impact, which was an approximately $51 million headwind, RPO grew 46% year-over-year. Current RPO increased 37% to $442.6 million. Total gross margin was 84%, reflecting ongoing investments in support and cloud infrastructure as we scale that business. Software gross margin was 91%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect gross margin to be greater than 80%. Second quarter operating expenses of $215.7 million increased 34%, reflecting only one month of benefit from the steps we took in the second quarter. GAAP operating loss of $120.2 million included $88.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating loss was $11.2 million. Second quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was negative $23.3 million. And we have $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and no debt. Let me now turn to guidance. First, we guide to what we see in the pipeline, which continues to fluctuate given the choppy macroeconomic environment, which we anticipate will continue. Second, more than half of our business is outside the U.S., and we price in local currency, including euro and yen. And as a result, there is a material FX headwind for both ARR and revenue that has significantly increased as we move through the year. Lastly, going forward, as Rob said, profitability is a core pillar of our go-forward strategy. While the reduction in our top line near-term forecast reflects the FX headwind of the macroeconomic environment and our internal repositioning, we are committed to our goal of achieving non-GAAP profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow in fiscal year 2024. Turning to the numbers. First, for fiscal third quarter 2023, we expect ARR in the range of $1.091 billion to $1.093 billion, included -- including an incremental FX headwind of approximately $5 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, ARR is expected to grow 36% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $243 million to $245 million, including an incremental FX headwind of approximately $10 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, revenue is expected to grow 22% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. We expect non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of negative $30 million to negative $25 million, reflecting the timing of investments that shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter and an incremental FX headwind of approximately $5 million. And we expect third quarter basic share count to be approximately 550 million shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect ARR in the range of $1.153 billion to $1.158 billion, including an incremental FX headwind of approximately $15 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, ARR is expected to grow 30% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. Revenue in the range of $1.002 billion to $1.007 billion, including an incremental FX headwind of approximately $25 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, revenue is expected to grow 22% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating loss of approximately negative $15 million, including an incremental FX headwind of approximately $15 million. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $25 million for the full fiscal year. Now, I'll turn the call back to Rob. Thanks, Ashim. Crossing $1 billion in ARR this year is a big achievement, but it is just the first milestone for us. I am confident that this is a multibillion dollar company that customers see as integral to how they run their business. We have a strong foundation to scale, and we are making decisions that put us on track to achieve growth and profitability. Our potential is enormous, and we believe in the long-term vision of the Company now more than ever. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming weeks and to laying out our strategy in more detail during our Investor Day on September 27. We'll now take questions, and I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Thanks for the extra clarity, Rob. Can you -- if you think about the strategic changes that you talked about, can you kind of double click on that a little bit more in terms of like the initiatives you're doing there? And usually, when you do that, you kind of have a period where you're negatively impacted, and then it should get better afterwards, which is why you're doing it. Can you just talk a little bit about how you see that evolving at the moment? And the second follow-up question for Ashim. If you think about the -- at the beginning of the year, you were one of the first to kind of call out some macro uncertainties. And back in March, you talked about the renewal pool, and you didn't know how customers would behave. If you think about the additional comments you made today, is that still the same issue? Is there something else that is happening? Can you just elaborate there a little bit more? Sure. Let me go first, Raimo. Thanks for the question. Yes. As we evolve and reposition the Company, we spoke early on about how we're driving digital sales, which is basically a combination of inside sales in our emerging segment, and we're very happy with the progress that we continue to make in that space. We need to position the Company to drive business outcomes into the C-level suite and position the enterprise automation platform to be the winner. And we actually believe that the product is absolutely incredible. And in order to do that, we are aligning the sales organization around that, bringing in new experienced talent. We promoted some talent internally as well. We've just announced the European leader. And we've seen some promising signs in North America as we move the automation platform. So we are pretty confident that over time, this is the right strategy. And as we said, we had layered out at Investor Day in very, very clear terms. And then, Raimo, just when you think about our guidance and tracing back to the first of the year, first, I'll remind everybody, look, we have a very strong foundation globally. So we actually have a very good view of just the overall exposure that's there. Here's what's different. FX continues to get worse and deteriorate, right? We came to parity on the euro. The yen continued to deteriorate as well as the quarter has progressed. We do see weakness in Europe and Japan in particular. And we see that reflected. I mean in our dollar-based net retention rate, we still see that as an asset when you take out the impact of FX. When you break that down one level further, the Americas dollar-based net retention rate when -- where not as exposed to the macroeconomic environment, we see a lot of strength there. We continue to see strength there. We also see strong gross net retention rates, which we talked about at 98%. So we still feel very confident in the value around our renewable base that our software is performing. So, we just -- we look at our pipeline. We look at the activity. We listen to what customers are saying. And we just find it appropriate given the environment to provide the guidance that we did here. Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Just wanted to focus on the guidance in terms of what you're hearing from customers. Maybe, Rob, you can start with this. In terms of just the lower sort of net new ARR expectations, obviously, excluding FX, are you seeing any sort of -- what are you seeing in terms of the change from customers? Are they simply shrinking maybe some of the scope of the deployments or just deployments as a whole getting pushed out? Any sort of more color there would be helpful. And also maybe compare that to what you have done in the first half. And I just had one follow-up for Daniel. Yes. Thanks, Phil. I would say to add on to Ashim's comments, we're definitely seeing budget discussions taking longer, C-level executives getting engaged in as we view automation, obviously, as a key growth lever for companies, but we've definitely seen those outcomes. And as we position new experienced leaders, we're going to be able to deal with that more. As I said earlier on, we do see the benefit, though, of that discussion in North America, where we are starting to see really positive signs in the [operating of the] (ph) segment as well. Got it. And then, Daniel, on the technology side, obviously, you've been investing organically and inorganically in expanding your portfolio. They're really trying to build out an end-to-end suite. When you talk to customers, what is starting to resonate? Is this starting to resonate with them? In particular, are there parts of that suite that are starting to carry more weight? Yes, hi, Phil. Look, I would say that our entire platform resonates very well with the customers. They find the value from process discovery, which is very important in finding opportunities for automation, to implementing where we play for personal automation and enterprise automation to delivering great outcomes -- measurable outcomes. We are seeing meaningful traction with our Test Suite, which is not only for testing RPA, but also for testing application implementation. And it's -- we are seeing it as becoming, like, a clear path in digital transformation as people are implementing new systems, and it's a lot of manual labor involved in testing the new systems, and it makes a lot of sense to automate the manual testing and then reuse building blocks into delivering an end-to-end automation. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. This is Sanjit for Keith. Rob, wanted to get a sense of some of the spending hesitancy so outside of the FX sort of impact. But in terms of customers trying to expand their business with you or attracting new customers, at a high level, you would think that automation would be a super high priority given the inflationary environment, given the need to get more efficient. And so in terms of the sources of those that spending hesitancy, is it about the implementation cycles? Is it about the payback period? I assume this extremely sells itself on an ROI basis. But if customers are prioritizing projects with 12 months or less payback, does this sort of automation fit that -- fit the bill, if you'd like? Or alternatively, are there potentially competitive issues that are sort of lengthening the sales cycles or lengthening the eval process? Any sort of color on the nature of the hesitancy to get deals done? Really appreciate. There's no question customers see the benefit of automation. I'd say the automation is market is evolving, and it's new. And when we look at the broader platform that takes into account what I would say is speed to value. I've spoken to some senior executives here in New York City in the bank, and they are looking to utilize UiPath's platform to drive really financial transformation in their organization. So, we see it in many of our conversations that's absolutely true. But as we look at it, those decisions are taking a little bit longer. They take a little bit more foresight, and customers are taking just a little bit longer to drive it. As we build the ROI calculators and drive the business outcomes with these customers, I'm absolutely convinced that this is -- their automation is definitely going to help companies do, not only digital transformation, but drives speed to value. In the lower enterprise segment, one can look at the emerging markets. We are still very relevant, and product is relevant. And we're doing very, very well in that segment, and that's where we acquire customers, and we continue to acquire customers. So, I would say, over time, I feel really confident that we will be able to deliver. And at the top end of the market, we need to focus on a denser ability to drive consumption with our largest accounts. And that's something that we focus on as well. Understood. I really appreciate that thought. And then as a follow-up, Ashim, I just want to get some -- maybe some context around the guidance. So as you look to the Q3 and the Q4 implied guide, are you extrapolating just the trend that you've seen through July through August to the balance of the year? It seems like Americas has been a source of strength. Do you assume that this strength continues in the Americas? Or are you being more conservative on that side of the business, too? In some sense, are you seeing something that's worse than what you've seen or just extrapolating what you've seen thus far? No. I mean, like we always say, we're very consistent with the way we guide. We guide to what we see in front of us today. And we see Americas strength. We have a lot of confidence in that business as we look at our pipeline and as we look at our execution there. I think Europe and Asia continue to be outsized impacted in terms of -- from a macro and a foreign exchange standpoint, and both of those that we have guided in. And the other piece is, as Rob said, we're repositioning the Company. And we're really excited about the leadership announcements that are out there. And so, we're also just accounting for the -- any transition that's natural as any company repositions itself in certain areas. So, those are the two factors that really give context around our guidance. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Ashim, is it possible to disaggregate the reduction in ARR? I think it's about 6% for the year. Into those three factors, I think you had mentioned FX, macro and your own internal repositioning. In other words, are those equivalent or are there varying magnitudes across those three? Yes. I mean when you look at -- I think FX is the one that is the most quantifiable in terms of where that is. And so we -- when you look at it versus the prior consensus in terms of the change in guidance, we look at that as $15 million to $20 million in terms of the impact just from FX. The macro and kind of some of the internal changes that we're doing and other items, for that, that's really hard to disaggregate. I would say we look at both of those as play as we give our guidance, that's there. So, the macro -- the FX is quantifiable, and I provided that, Mark. The other two, I would just say, is more guiding based on our pipeline that we see in front of us today. Understood. And then I had a quick follow-up, perhaps for Daniel or Rob. I'm wondering if you're seeing equivalent growth rates for automation that run entirely inside the Microsoft environment versus those that are stretching across multiple environments. And if there's any way you could just remind us, what does that mix stand out of the kind of Microsoft-only environment today? Well, traditionally, and it continues today, our technology was mostly used for complex processes that usually spend multiple systems. This is actually the strength of our technology. And most of our customers have multiple enterprise systems. This is -- it's a big difference between an enterprise automation platform that works very well across multiple systems and in application automation, that's Microsoft and similar system application providers, have basically entered the market recently. So, I am very confident that we have the only complete platform that offers an end-to-end process automation that is differentiated for our customers. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Rob, I was wondering, can you just talk about the environment maybe from a vertical or an industry perspective? Are you seeing any difference in the discussions you're having in certain industries rather than others at this point in time? And I guess just some of the earlier questions on the sales organization. Anything you all are thinking about doing sort of towards the end of this year? Or will any sort of changes with some of the new folks coming in be more positioned at the beginning of fiscal '24? Yes. Thanks, Kirk. Good question. So, we're evolving the sales organization in flight. I would say, when you look at the industry, we continue to see significant demand for financial services, for health care and for manufacturing. I wouldn't say the environment impacting any of them more than others, for sure. I would say, it's much more geographical. Some things that we're doing in terms of -- we're driving significant uptick with partners, for sure. We're looking at distribution models. We're looking at the emerging to graduate accounts into the enterprise segment, and as I said, at the density level. The majority of those changes will take place in the beginning of the year as we have brought in new talent and we align our outcome to that. But we feel good about what we're seeing in the market already around business outcomes and how enterprise automation drives speed to value for companies. Our next question is from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. I wanted to ask on the revenue headwind associated with just the cloud transition. I think it was four points previously. So first, any change to that assumption? And then just thinking out further, should we expect a more deliberate push on cloud deployment by clients that caused that headwind to potentially get worse as we go forward beyond this fiscal year? And I guess, can you give us any sense of deployment mix in the revenue base now and how you're thinking about puts and takes of that progressing, it would be helpful. Yes. So the four points stays relatively consistent for the second half. We don't see any change in our assumption there. The launch of our Automation Cloud robots was very successful, but it's on track with the way we have discussed it and modeled it post our launch of 22.4. When we think about going forward, Bryan, like longer-term assumptions, those are things we'll discuss at Investor Day, but we don't see anything significant at this moment versus the previous assumptions that we've given. In terms of Automation Cloud robots, which is the biggest impact from a revenue standpoint, we've already gotten a dozen customers there. It's been great feedback. We mentioned iCIMS in our script, and there's a great partnership emerging there that is using there. And we see other companies as well like Smartsheet and other companies very interested to see how they can take advantage of those Automation Cloud robot capabilities. To sum it up, no change in the assumption. We'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but there's no significant difference at this moment in terms of that as a headwind. Okay. And just understanding FX you've given for ARR in the back half here. Any further color you can give on NDBR as you go through 3Q and 4Q? Yes, I mean net dollar-based retention, we had a 300 basis point FX headwind that is there. Like I mentioned, when you disaggregate it, really, Europe and Japan have the largest impact on the deceleration of the net dollar-based retention rate. We do have confidence in -- as we reposition the Company to reaccelerate that and as FX and macro stabilizes. Right now, those are the two largest pressures that we feel is just really from those two geographies. Our next question is from Brad Sills with BofA Securities. Please proceed with your question. Wanted to ask about land versus expand. I think a couple of years ago, the Company pivoted more towards expansion deals, understanding that the installed base was such that there was that opportunity. You can see dollar-based net retention has been holding nicely in the one 30-plus range here. Is there any plans to go back towards land potentially here? Or do you still see that opportunity within the installed base to kind of continue to drive this kind of growth with more focus on expansion deals? Yes, Bryan, great question. So we definitely see the opportunity to drive expansion deals. As the automation -- the enterprise automation platform becomes very relevant for companies, that is how we would want to do it. We also want to see how we can drive it in a really top segment in key accounts and provide a density model there. And we're also looking at customers in terms of the propensity that they have to expand. So we're actually looking at the full segmentation and how do we drive an efficiency model in terms of acquiring a company, promoting a company and ensuring that they have density with consumption. Understood. And then one more, if I may, please. Just you mentioned bolstering the competitive moat. What are some of the things that you think of in the road map here that are behind that potential to continue to build upon the platform and the capabilities that do differentiate UiPath? So I'll start and hand over to Daniel. Just having spent the last three months visiting customers and partners doing world tours, I've been to Asia, Europe a couple of times, I've met probably 60-plus companies, right, I will tell you that we have a very unique platform that nobody else has in the market in an end-to-end way, from discovery to process understanding, ability to fulfill it through RPA and AI and ML and the ability to connect to test and then have insights into how they can operate in a company. That message, when we connect that branding to the C-suite, I think, is going to be incredible. And then Daniel can talk a little bit about the details on the technology. Yes. So, we are the only platform that succeeded in combining API-based automation with UI-based automation. We deliver it in a single low-code, no-code platform that is easy to learn. This is tremendously important to automate a vast array of existing processes and new processes. We completed the platform by adding document understanding that is based on our AI foray and machine learning, and we are making steady progress there. We are building a world-class platform. We have acquired Process Mining three years ago. We've done cloud replatforming of the technology, and are the clear number two in the -- in that part of the technology, and we are closing fastest the gap with the number one in the Process Mining. Plus, our discovery suite that combines Process Mining, Task Mining, Test Capture, automation hub is unparalleled in helping our customers discover both processes at system lock level and tasks on harvesting the data on the desktop level. We are making steady progress on smoothly integrating all the components of the platform delivered in a single unified experience for the end user. Our next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. I guess, Rob, first question for you. There's been a number of questions about just the strategic repositioning of the Company. Go-to-market kind of excellence that you're focused on. If you had to look, just given your time so far at the Company and just thinking ahead over the next 12 to 24 months, where do you see the biggest impact, though, to this key metric ARR? Is it new customers on the enterprise side coming into the fold? Can digital sales actually add up to a lot more for the expansion with your existing enterprise customers? Can you kind of pick apart those three areas? Or maybe I'm missing something. I'm just trying to understand what you have the biggest needle mover. And then I had a question for Ashim. Yes. We need to do both on that. In other words, selling products into the emerging enterprise segment is a great way to acquire new customers. Then we need to determine how to reposition these companies so that we actually drive enterprise level scale activity. When we look at enterprise level scale activity, that's where we're talking about driving enterprise automation as a theme through companies. So, we have to do both. We have to continue to acquire companies. We have to understand which part of these companies have the propensity to expand. And when we know and understand where the propensity is, we need to make certain that we provide dense coverage to them so that we can accelerate the expansion as well. So, we're looking at that level of efficiency. And we're also leaning on our partners in this space to help us drive this. So Terry, it's not just one play. It's multiple plays. I think we've done really well at the acquisition. I think our digital sales organization is really very, very good and very scaled. And you can see that across the board. And we have a unique opportunity to evolve enterprise automation to become truly a business play that drives speed to value. We're also looking at creating solution packages so that it makes it easier for companies to understand what we're selling and how to position it, and that applies as well to our sales folks. All these pieces coming together we'll -- we will lay out at Investor Day very, very clearly for everybody to understand how this will evolve over time. Got it. Thanks, Rob. And just a follow-up for Ashim. I think you all talked about a path to non-GAAP EBIT or operating income profitability and free cash flow positive. Is that for the full year of FY '24? Or would that be at some point within the year when you hit that -- those metrics? Yes. Look, we're committed to profitability. I just want to emphasize that to begin with. We're going to talk more about this at Investor Day. What we said in the script is pretty clear in terms of we want to get sustainable and profitable in the short term, and fiscal 2024 is definitely insights for us, but we're going to talk more and provide more specific information at Investor Day. Our next question is from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. A couple of questions. Kind of coming back, Ashim, I think, maybe best to Raimo's question about going back to Q4 when you had seen some negativity. So just walk us through this trajectory, if you would, where in Q4, you said you were seeing macro pretty much across the board impacting the pipeline, not just in Europe. And then last quarter, I think you said that customers were starting to get a handle on things. And now things seem worse again from a sales cycle perspective, and particularly that in macro. So -- excuse me, in certain geos. So if you could just walk us through why bad, been better and bad again, that would be helpful. Yes. So one is like I want to make sure, like, we guide to what's in front of us, right? That is a very consistent way in which we guide from -- and that we have from the very beginning. It's a really dynamic environment. I just -- I want to make sure -- I think we all can attest to that, and we feel it. So really, coming out of last quarter, we felt more optimism in EMEA, in particular, when we were guiding in terms of that. Right now, we see it, it's much more challenging than expected on the ground there. Rob can also give more color on that as he has the discussions with customers. So really Japan, EMEA, Europe as well as kind of some parts of Asia, like they are all -- they all feel just more challenged when we look at the dynamics right here today, and we guide what's in front of us. At the same time, we feel like the opportunity for automation is big. We see our customers engage. Our dollar-based net retention rate to me shows the durability of our model and the value proposition that we have. And as we talk about guidance, we want to make sure that we are responsible and prudent and derisk the second half of the year just given the dynamic environment in which we're in. I'll let Rob give more color on Europe et cetera. No, I just think it's consistent. I mean having spent time in Europe in the last couple of months, I would say we had slight optimism that companies that got used to what is happening in the war -- I think we said the word become more regional. But I think the -- certainly, the level of what's happening now with the inflation and the energy and so on is having an impact, and companies are thinking about what to invest and where to invest, and they're taking a significant amount of time to make those decisions. The more we focus on automation in helping companies and delivering that message to companies, I'm pretty convinced that we will be more successful in Europe, for sure. And then my follow-up, I think someone else asked about competition, but not sure if you answered it or maybe I missed it, but what -- is there any change in the competitive environment, whether it's typical people we would think of like Microsoft or not just other companies doing RPA, but think of it as maybe potential for competition with substitute products, whether something like low code where you do have some offerings also? So are you seeing more competition strictly in RPA and then maybe with alternative ways of solving the problem? We are not seeing any material change in the competitive landscape since -- in the past three months. And we have -- we continue to see Microsoft but limited to personal automation. In enterprise automation, we are competing with more of our traditional competitors. We are not seeing the new entrants like ServiceNow, Salesforce into our opportunities. We -- they are probably -- we are seeing them in less than 1% of our opportunities. At this moment, I'm pretty confident we have a very differentiated platform that it's a clear leader in automation as attested by various analysts, by our customers, by anyone basically. Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. I know there have been several on the go-to-market changes, but I do want to go back to that topic. We saw Chris and Rob joined earlier in the year. We have a few new regional announcements on the team there this quarter. Commentary in terms of the backdrop still sounds clear that automation is a big opportunity. But given changes in go-to-market changes in macro, how do you make sure you aren't taking your eye off the ball in the core automation space? And are those changes things you're able to kind of shore up ahead of the user conference, the customer conference and just the upcoming importance of the fiscal Q4 period that you have in front of you? Yes. We feel confident that we have -- that showed up, but I would also add in terms of the RPA or the automation -- the core automation, that continues to expand. And then you see that in the digital sales piece. But as we reposition, the broader enterprise automation is a platform play that we have to drive true business outcomes and faster ROI environment. And many of the leaders that we brought in understand that, and we will bring in more experienced leaders as well to actually to drive that environment. And to be honest, when you look at this, and many of you will be at Investor Day, their attendance for FORWARD 5 is amazing. So I'm absolutely convinced, one, is we have the right strategy. We layed out it very, very clearly for you. You'll see that we are focused on ensuring that we will get enterprise automation at the right level. And at FORWARD 5, with the amount of folks that are showing up, it clearly shows that we are the automation leader, and we have a unique value proposition across the board for all aspects of automation. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. A lot of mine have been asked, but just two more kind of clarifying questions on previously discussed topics. Maybe the first one, just -- it sounds like the guidance has been derisked for incremental macro deterioration in Europe, but have you reflected anything in terms of incremental macro deterioration in the U.S. in the guidance? And then as a follow-up, just the confidence interval here around, to some extent, just to Michael's point, that the execution changes that you're putting in place and the repositioning don't have an outsized impact on actually closing the business at the end of this year's Q4. So I'll start with the guidance. So one is I think that the Americas from our standpoint, and we guide what's in front of us. As of this point, we don't forecast further deterioration in Americas. We have our sales leader in place that -- the announcement came out that was recently promoted, has been with the Company. From a macro standpoint, we still feel good about the pipeline relative to Europe and to Japan. And the indicators, like I said, we have strong dollar-based net retention rate. We are not FX exposed in Americas. So, I think we are appropriately guiding for where we are today. Of course, anything could change from a macroeconomic environment, but we guide for what's in front of us at this moment. And then in terms of the overall year, like again, we've accounted for not just the macro, but also the repositioning for -- of the Company. As Raimo kind of talked about even in the beginning, we've derisked that in -- as a part of our guidance. The impact that comes with any change, and we feel very positive and excited about the change for our long term, but we acknowledge some of the short-term risk that that could create. Yes. We've derisked, and we pretty -- we see -- when we say we see positive signs in North America, we look -- we're seeing the opportunity of deals, larger deals coming into the pipeline. And we have actually implemented a very strict forecasting policy. So, we feel really good about the derisking and the opportunity in front of us in North America. Our next question is from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. I think likewise, many of my questions have been asked, but I wanted to check in about just sales across the platform. Clearly, we understand that UiPath is going to market with an end-to-end automation platform, but are you seeing any particular segments that are kind of running a bit hotter or are seeing more demand or some areas that might be a little bit softer or receiving additional scrutiny, say, between PA versus Process Mining versus Task Mining, just various different aspects of your platform? So when we look across the platform, I really want to -- we see customers wanting to buy the platform. And I think the metric that actually reflects the best is our customer is greater than $100,000, and our customers greater than $1 million, which we showed continued positive momentum in both of those areas. We've discussed in the past that we do have the ELA offerings that are there for customers. And what's attractive for that is they get the full breadth of our platform and full automation capabilities from Discover to the core RPA to additional abilities as well. So those two metrics really show that. Do we believe there is some more opportunity? Yes. And I think Rob talked about that in the script. And that is some of the areas that we're going to be talking about at Investor Day. Rob can add as well from his comments with customers. I think you answered it. I think that there's opportunity. There's significant opportunity. This market is not constrained. We need to go after that opportunity. Test Suite is clearly an amazing product in the market. It connects -- Test Suite testing -- test automation across all platforms, and it allows you to automate the -- to automate automation inside the automation platform. So I think we have a unique and a big opportunity in that space. And on the discovery side, customers are just getting started. And if I can get one more in. You hire today or rather announcement today of hiring Mark Gibbs, his background at SAP, also just looks like the integration you announced with Workday. Is there anything to read here that you're seeing more opportunity in either HCM or in ERP-related work we there? Because it's clear certainly that some players in the space have been focusing on automation. Yes. And maybe we haven't been clear, but I would tell you, I see -- I'd phrase it maybe a different way. I see a significant opportunity in embedding automation into technology products where those products will drive higher value services for their customers. I think iCIMS is a great example of that, and we are talking to a number of technology providers in this space. So I think that is a runway that we can drive for. Our product is really well suited to being embedded in other solution sets. And clearly, when you look at the different ERP markets or transaction provider markets, we focus on sub-processes. And so we are additive, additive in terms of how customers would see value. And any customer that's going through digital transformation or a transformation or migration, whether it'd be SAP or Oracle or Workday or Salesforce, including automation into that transformation is an incredible opportunity. And that's where we see the CIOs will see automation going forward. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll now turn the call over to Rob Enslin for closing remarks. Thank you very much, everybody, for attending today. We really appreciate it, and we look forward to seeing everyone at Investor Day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kelsey Turcotte of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today to review UiPath’s third quarter fiscal 2023 financial results, which we announced in our earnings press release issued after the close of the market today.
On the call with me are Daniel Dines, UiPath’s Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Rob Enslin, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ashim Gupta, Chief Financial Officer. Rob will start the discussion and then turn the call over to Daniel. After that Ashim will review our results and provide guidance. Then we will open the call for questions.
Our earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. We will be discussing non-GAAP metrics on today’s call.
This afternoon’s call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and our financial guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements.
For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, and our other reports filed with the SEC, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2022 to be filed with the SEC. Forward looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today, we undertake no obligation to update them.
I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
As a reminder we price in local currency and have experienced a significant foreign exchange headwind as we have progressed through this fiscal year.
Now, I would like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with third quarter results, which delivered both topline growth and margin expansion. ARR was $1.110 billion, driven by net new ARR of $67 million. Excluding the FX headwind of $22 million, total ARR grew 38% year-over-year.
Revenue was $263 million. Excluding the FX headwind of $22 million, revenue grew 29% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was $18 million, a third quarter record, reflecting our focus on disciplined capital allocation and cost management.
During the quarter we added new logos like Petco, Nautilus and Wisconsin Energy, and saw particular strength in our healthcare and telecommunications verticals. A great new logo in the quarter was Orica, one of the world’s leading mining and infrastructure solutions providers.
In a competitive win over two standalone vendors, one in enterprise automation and one in test automation, and working with Accenture as an advisor, Orica selected UiPath, because of our ability to deliver both enterprise and test automation in one platform.
With C-suite sponsorship, Orica is planning to migrate and scale their existing enterprise automation program with UiPath and utilize test suite to enable successful upgrades of their SAP S4/HANA.
Third quarter is also the federal year-end, and under new leadership, we are very pleased to report that we delivered a strong quarter in that vertical, including expansions with The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Customers appreciate both the quantifiable and intangible business outcomes that our automation platform can deliver, including business risk reduction, improved customer and employee experience, profitable growth and the ability to more effectively allocate resources. These are outcomes that resonate across lines of business and up to the C-suite.
For example, one of North America’s largest third-party logistics firms, Total Quality Logistics, is using Document Understanding, software robots and Task Mining across their organization. In just two years automation has delivered both strong ROI and helped them grow, including driving revenue in a new line of business without adding headcount. Going forward, Total Quality Logistics also plans to implement Process Mining to identify macro processes that can benefit from automation.
It has been a busy few months for the team and we are executing well across all of the key strategic initiatives that we laid out at our Investor Day. These include, extending our market leadership with our largest platform release 22.10, which Daniel will talk about in more detail, driving platform adoption with our market-leading capabilities in every stage of the automation lifecycle, making significant progress upleveling our go-to-market model, which I will talk about in more detail next, announcing some great technical and go-to-market partnerships, and lastly, to build out our world class team, with the addition of Lee Hawksley who will lead our APAC go-to-market team.
Now, I would like to take a few minutes to update you on progress we have made on our go-to market initiatives. All of this work is designed to enable our teams to sell higher into organizations, define business outcomes that resonate with C-level executives and accelerate customer time to value.
To make sure we are on the right track we tested many of these new approaches in our North American market and were very pleased to see they played an important role in several notable third quarter wins.
Next step is a formal roll-out across the geos, much of which we started at the beginning of the fourth quarter when we launched new packaging and pricing designed to simplify our go-to-market motion. This approach brings together the solutions necessary to more quickly realize the advantages of broader platform adoption in a one line-item SKU. We also expect this pricing model to reduce friction in the purchasing process.
We formally introduced NorthStar, our new value-based selling tool. This prescriptive and predictive model helps our sales reps position the value of automation to customers through an engagement framework that defines economic value, the execution roadmap and best practices. It is a great tool to clearly position the differentiated, long-term benefits of automation delivered through our full platform of capabilities.
We are also leveraging our extensive industry insights to align sales teams around verticals like financial services, healthcare and TMT, where we have had good success to-date and identified considerable white space to continue to grow in both new and existing customers.
The focus helped us close a third quarter expansion deal in the financial services vertical with Bank of New York Mellon Pershing, a UiPath customer since 2020. Through their implementation of UiPath, their automation program scaled quickly, improving both efficiency and risk mitigation across the firm, as well as their client experience by leveraging UiPath’s software robots to process transactions more consistently. As a result of these positive outcomes, Bank of New York Mellon is now rapidly expanding to the full platform across their organization.
And to give customers in these verticals even more tools for success, we are pilot -- piloting our first Solution Accelerator to provide them a starting point for their automation journey. We are excited about Solution Accelerators and believe they will provide our customers with the technical knowhow to help them complete their implementations significantly faster.
With customer success always in mind, we continue to deepen our relationships with
global GSIs and automation experts. At Forward 5 we announced our expanded partnership with EY, also one of the largest UiPath customers, that puts the partnership on par and at scale with their largest Ecosystem Partners.
The strengthening of this global alliance is a testament to the trust that we have developed and their belief in the massive growth potential that the UiPath automation platform presents for global organizations.
We also continue to expand our technical ecosystem. During the quarter, we announced several strategic partnerships with major technology providers, including Microsoft, which named UiPath as their preferred enterprise automation partner, while we announced Microsoft Azure is a preferred cloud platform for UiPath. We plan to continue to collaborate and innovate together to bring automation solutions powered by Microsoft Azure to market.
And Outsystems, to combine the power of the UiPath Business Automation Platform with OutSystems’ high-performance, low-code. Together, we expect to enable customers to securely and intelligently automate core business processes and applications.
One of the best proof points of our execution is the growth of our larger customer cohorts and this quarter we were very pleased that our cohort of customers over $100,000 in ARR increased to 1,711, including customers over $1 million of 201. For these customers, automation isn’t just a tool they can use to reduce or eliminate tedious work, it’s part of their strategy, growth plans and operating model.
I feel good about where we are in our journey to take this company beyond $1 billion. We have the market-leading automation technology and platform, the right leaders putting the right go-to-market structure in place and we are making the disciplined decisions that allow us to drive growth, increase productivity and expand operating margin. We are already seeing the positive impact of our work as we head into the fourth quarter and the team is focused on a strong close.
I will turn the call over to Daniel to talk about our 22.10 platform release and newest innovation. Daniel? Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I’d like to thank the UiPath team for their hard work and commitment to our customers and partners who recognize and appreciate your dedication to their success.
In fact, one of the things I enjoy most about my role at UiPath is spending time with customers to understand where they are in their digital transformation journey and talk to them about the role automation can play in that evolution.
Given today’s unpredictable operating environment and tightening budgets, automation is a powerful engine that directly addresses these challenges and changes the way organizations of all sizes operate and innovate.
We had great platform expansions in the quarter, such as ManpowerGroup, a UiPath customer for four years. After successfully deploying automations in their finance department, they expanded to use our full platform in the quarter as they look to scale their automation program internally and deliver workforce solutions to their clients.
Ultimately, platforms win, because integrated technology is easier to manage and drives faster time to value. With market-leading capabilities in every stage of the automation lifecycle, our platform outcomes resonate with the C-suite and are a huge competitive advantage for us.
A great example of platform adoption is a deal we closed with HCA Healthcare, one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers. HCA has been a UiPath customer for two years with numerous software automations in production. In the quarter they expanded our partnership by adopting the entire UiPath platform in a multiyear agreement.
Coming out of our Forward 5 user conference and our most important platform release this fall, 22.10, momentum is building across the business. This release allows customers to automate more, faster and with less friction, expand user and builder bases, and operate it all more efficiently and effectively.
This recent platform release includes a preview of Studio Web, the latest member of our Studio family, which completes our cloud offering, further reduces the friction in ramping citizen developers, and provides a cross platform developer experience.
22.10 also delivers the ability to build public-facing applications with UiPath Apps, enhanced capabilities in Process and Task Mining, and platform intelligence to help our software robots understand both structured data with Document Understanding and unstructured data with the acquisition of Re:infer.
There’s a massive amount of value to be captured by automating processes involving unstructured data. During the quarter, several customers added Re:infer, which we recently acquired and have renamed Communications Mining to their automation program.
This includes a leading U.K. fund administrator and UiPath customer since 2019, that is planning to leverage Re:infer to drive efficiencies and improve customer experiences by automating tickets in their case management system for their HR, payroll, accounting and tax departments.
22.10 also delivered enhanced capabilities for both Automation Suite and Automation Cloud, both of which helped drive triple-digit year-over-year growth in Cloud ARR. One of our core tenants is flexibility of deployment to meet the customer wherever they are on their automation journey. This constant focus on innovation has won us recognition by thought leaders and industry analysts and we are proud of the recent reports from Everest Group and ISG.
According to Everest Group’s Robotic Process Automation Products PEAK Matrix Assessment 2022, we were named an RPA Leader for the sixth consecutive year and Star Performer in the Technology Provider Landscape.
ISG named UiPath a leader in their latest application development research focused on low-code/no-code software companies. This recognition reflects our commitment to category leadership and innovation across the platform.
I am proud of what we accomplished in the third quarter and excited about the massive opportunity ahead. The need for automation is greater than ever before and I believe UiPath will continue to play a leading role in helping organizations not only thrive, but increase their competitive advantage.
With that, I will turn it over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year-over-year. I also want to note that FX was a significant headwind to our results again this quarter. I will start by running through our third quarter and then provide fourth quarter guidance.
Third quarter ARR totaled $1.110 billion, driven by net new ARR of $67 million. Because we sell in local currency, foreign currency fluctuations do not impact demand for our product, but do impact the translation of our results.
On a year-over-year basis, FX was an approximately $10 million headwind to net new ARR, and for total ARR, FX was an approximately $22 million headwind. Excluding FX, total ARR grew 38%.
We now serve approximately 10,650 customers. As we shared at Investor Day, we are positioning the company to land and grow customers with a high propensity to invest in automation, while distributors will serve the lower end of the market.
Moving on, our dollar based net retention rate was 126%. Normalizing for FX and excluding the impact of Russian sanctions, our dollar based net retention rate was 130%. Americas continues to show strength as our dollar based net retention rate outperformed relative to the rest of the world. Dollar based gross retention of 98% continues to be best-in-class, underscoring the transformational business outcomes that customers achieve with our platform.
Revenue grew to $263 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $22 million, revenue grew 29% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations increased to $759 million. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $50 million, RPO grew 40% year-over-year. Current RPO increased to $441 million.
Total gross margin was 86%, reflecting ongoing investments in support and cloud infrastructure as we scale that business. Software gross margin was 92%.
Third quarter operating expenses were $209 million. We continue to focus on operational efficiency including our restructuring actions, hiring freeze and tighter control of discretionary spend.
GAAP operating loss of $67 million included $81 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating income was $18 million, our strongest third quarter non-GAAP operating margin to-date.
Third quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was negative $24 million, reflecting timing of collections and prepaid vendor contracts that allow us to lock in favorable terms for UiPath in an inflationary environment.
We have a very strong balance sheet, which is an important asset in the current operating environment, with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Now, let me now turn to guidance. We guide what we see in the pipeline and assume that the current choppy macro environment and pressure from foreign exchange continue.
Turning to the numbers. First, for fiscal fourth quarter 2023, we expect ARR in the range of $1.174 billion to $1.176 billion. This is an increase from prior guidance of $1.153 billion to $1.158 billion. We expect revenue in the range of $277 million to $279 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $35 million. And we expect fourth quarter basic share count to be approximately 554 million shares outstanding.
Finally, we will guide to first quarter and full year fiscal 2024 when we announce our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight that we expect typical enterprise seasonality from the fourth quarter to first quarter in both net new ARR and revenue results.
We delivered a solid third quarter as our durable financial model and strong balance sheet give us the resources to invest in long-term growth and drive sustained profitability, both of which are core to our go-forward strategy. The team is focused on delivering meaningful outcomes for our customers and we look forward to a strong close to fiscal year 2023.
Finally, I would like to wish our employees and all of you a healthy and happy holiday season and we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks.
With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator. Operator, please poll for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I appreciate all the color, particularly on the go-to-market changes, which is really where I want to focus my question. Rob, obviously, you made some changes when you joined and I wonder if you could walk us through just sort of your thoughts on call productivity versus just capacity in the sales force? How do you kind of think with these changes you are making sort of productivity should start to inflect? And then, similarly, how do you feel about sort of the capacity of the go-to-market push right now? And then just have one follow-up. Yeah. Thanks, Phil. We feel good about the capacity we have got and aligns with the strategy we outlined at Investor Day and we are starting to see real proof points around our strategy and how we are delivering that and the team is actually focused on really good delivery.
So if you look at, like, what I would say is, one of the best proof points of our execution is the growth of our customer cohorts. When you look at $100,000 in ARR. We have increased that to 1,711. And when you look at customers over $1 million now, it’s up to 201. So we feel good about the go-to-market, the segmentation and our execution and how far we have come in a relatively short period of time. Great. And then, Daniel, you highlighted just efficiency that need to drive productivity as a catalyst for automation for companies, obviously, the dollar-based net retention continues to remain strong and it feels like that’s resonating with the customer -- existing customers that already have proof points of success. But when you go to new customers that have maybe just starting their automation journey, what makes sort of the light bulb go off of sort of, why automation, why RPA in just your full hyper automation suite is something they should lean into from a productivity standpoint? I think this is kind of the same motivation as for existing customers, they drive, close down the improve employees’ productivity, they improve also customer satisfaction and we are seeing meaningful new customers that are getting into automation by buying the entire platform.
And I can -- for instance, in the case of Orica that I think Rob mentioned, the Orica -- our -- the power of our testing was instrumental into driving the adoption of the entire platform and it was the competitive takeout of two of our competitors. So I would say that the benefit of automation is even more relevant in this environment for the new customers. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Oh! Great. Thanks so much and it’s great to see some of the early success with the changes in go-to-market. Maybe on that topic, please, Rob, if you could expand a little bit on where you have seen some success. I know it’s early, but with some of these verticals you called out some of these solution accelerators. Are there any ones in particular you would call out and are there any learnings from your success in those areas that you might be able to apply more broadly? Yeah. Brad, some of its antidotal, because we are very early into actually the numbers. But I think -- first of all, I think the proof points around ATA, Bank of New York Mellon and Orica are proof points of the NorthStar approach that we -- the value selling around NorthStar and then driving significant value and this speed to value is showing progress. We also have seen our solution packages. We started to launch them significant interest. We don’t have actually clear KPIs, but we are seeing significant interest.
And I think our sales organization has more tools in the bag to deal with the environment we are operating in and they are doing really well around that. We see significant progress -- obviously, continue to see significant progress in the United States around that and we are starting to see with the team in Europe that’s having benefit as well. And look, I mean, Orica is a world-class leading energy company based out of Singapore operating globally and shows that we are starting to see progress with our strategy globally as well. Wonderful. Thanks. And then one for you, Ashim, if I may, please, on just the outlook that you provided at the Analyst Day for next year, ARR growth exiting the year at 20%. It’s down quite a bit, I mean, this quarter, you are at 38% constant currency, you are guiding to 20, it looks like 27%, maybe 29% constant currency for Q4, so a pretty big deceleration. Are you assuming a worsening macro in that outlook or if you could just remind us what are you assuming in that number? Thank you. Yeah. Brad, like, we discussed at Investor Day, the anchor points that we provided for next year assumes the current macro environment that we have all -- that we have been talking about, and as well as the FX or the foreign exchange environment that we have also been seeing. We really see this as consistent from forward and our Investor Day until now. We will provide more of an update as we get into next year and report fourth quarter earnings. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thank you and congrats on the great margin progress. So, Ashim, I don’t think you actually spent quite as much time on talking about macro issues tonight. And so I am wondering if it would be logical to think that this period of Q3 and Q4 could represent the trough for the net new ARR. What I mean is, if it’s declining here in this 25% to 40% range and then maybe there would be an opportunity to kind of improve on that as you get further into the repositioning and the repackaging and the go-to-market changes in the first half of next year. Is that -- as a general framework, is that a fair way to be thinking about the trending of the business? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yeah, Mark, it’s very consistent with what we have talked at Investor Day and Analyst Day. We look at the environment as consistent. So we probably have talked less about it just in terms of the environment between Europe, APAC and Americas, we feel relatively the same environment as we talked about just a few months ago.
In terms of our commitment to executing on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day, we are all committed and actually excited about the progress that we are making around segmentation, solutioning, focus, identifying high propensity customers. All of those factors in our mind, we feel are going to yield positive results and that’s what we are executing to.
I would remind everybody just we are going to see typical seasonality as we get into next year between first quarter we mentioned in the script, but also first half, second half. But, overall, we are pleased with the execution of the strategy and we do -- we are executing that strategy because we believe it will yield positive results. Okay. Understood. And maybe as a quick follow-up for Rob and Daniel. Could you touch a little on the expanded Microsoft Azure relationship. I believe Microsoft said that UiPath is going to be one of their largest partners that’s built on Microsoft technology, I think, they referred to it that way. What type of opportunity do you see with Microsoft and is that something that’s helping you win business out there incrementally at this point? Thanks for the question. Let me start and then Rob might add more color to it. I feel that we made a good bet on basing on having our technology built on the top of Microsoft Azure cloud that help us drive create cloud offering that resonates with most of our customers.
It really helps us to reduce the sales cycle when it comes to the cloud, it reduced the sales cost and it increased time to value to our customers. Microsoft has been really a good partner for us, both on the technology innovation and partnering on the go-to-market side. So we are really looking at a positive development on this front. Rob? I think that’s good. Thanks, Mark Thank you. And our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question. Thank you. Two quick questions. One on staying on partners, competitors, et cetera, and Rob, you spent, obviously, a lot of years at SAP. Like how do we have to think about the SAP relationship, a lot of your businesses, isn’t that SAP installed base, helping on process optimization, et cetera. SAP is making more noise about doing it themselves. Like how is that relationship evolving? That’s my first question and then I have one follow-up for Ashim. Yeah. Look, I mean, we -- first of all, I would say, you have got to look at our portfolio. Our portfolio, we are very strong in financials and healthcare. So we have a broad portfolio that we go after.
So it’s not only our partnership with SAP that we are working on and we have got a partnership. We -- they utilize some of our technology. We obviously work closely with them and we continue to work closely with them, because we believe we have a mutual benefit in helping customers add value and together with the customer base and the customer fit they have.
We think there’s an incredible value for our customers. But that also includes other companies in that space as well. So we continue to progress. Key partnerships are clearly part of the strategy we laid out at Investor Day and we continue to evolve that every quarter. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Ashim, obviously, a lot of investors look at net new ARR added and you had a really strong $67 million this quarter. If I look at the implied number for Q4, it does seem different than what we saw in Q4 last year. Could you just kind of speak a little bit if there are specific factors that might drive that, I remember like a couple of years ago, we had the change in the year end, et cetera, like just anything that we should know about or remember about Q4? Thank you. Yeah. So in Q4 we have a more pronounced impact from foreign exchange. I think that’s the first notable point Raimo. The reason for that is a lot of our renewable base, which obviously will renew at a potentially lower FX rate -- at the current FX rate, I should say. That has a $20 million impact year-over-year. So when you look at what we have implicitly guided at around $66 million and you add $20 million back for that, that takes you to $86 million.
And then you take into account the macro -- the impact from the macro environment and we have been consistent in our guidance philosophies in terms of guiding what we see in front of us. That’s kind of how you think about the components of the guide and the factor for why it is $66 million right now. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hey. This is Simran on for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking our questions. So with the uncertainty you noted earlier about the current environment, has the tone of your customer conversations changed at all and do you see more hesitancy with customers are experiencing longer sales cycles? Yeah. What we have been very clear about is we see a consistency between the quarters that we saw in Q2 into Q3 and we believe that we are actually managing it really well right now. Got it. And then also earlier, you announced an additional reduction in your workforce. How are you thinking about the reallocation of those budgets towards greater efficiency and execution and customer strategies? Yeah. Good question. So the restructuring was that we announced two weeks ago, I think. Part of the strategic discussions we had at Investor Day and the rollout. That is a cross-functional restructuring that we have. It has very little impact, the minimum impact on our quota carriers and our go-to-market, and we continue to execute the go-to-market as we design this around the strategic initiatives. Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Ashim, on the operating margins, you guys really outperformed kind of what the original guide was there. Is that all coming from the headcount reductions or is there more efficiency kind of improvements that are coming from other parts of the business? And how should we think about that kind of the potential for further progression there into FY 2024 perhaps? Yeah. So not -- the headcount reduction, just to answer directly and then I will walk you through the operating margin, Keith. The headcount reduction was announced on November 15th. So what we announced had very little impact -- no impact on our third quarter results.
When you break down and you look at how the operating margin came together, the first is the topline. The team did a great job on executing in the environment and so we outperformed the topline, and of course, that flows through and falls through to the bottomline.
The second is, while we know we were in a period of reorganization, we had a hiring freeze that we put in place and we installed a lot of operating -- we -- in this environment, our entire employee base, I think, understands the environment and we are operating with a lot of discipline. So you just take those two factors in there. That really explains the beat.
In terms of the go forward, I’d point you back to kind of our discussions at Investor Day and the anchor points that we provided, we are committed to margin expansion. We see a path to be able to grow durably and profitably, and we are going to operate with discipline, but still execute a strategy for growth that we have laid out together. Got it. And then one follow-up and I think this is probably for Rob. In terms of net new customer growth, it looks pretty weak in the quarter, like, just overall, net new customer growth at like 150. That’s the lowest that we have seen since you guys have gone public and even the customer is over 100,000. This is -- it was a relatively small increase versus what we have seen historically. Is this part and parcel of the distribution changes or more of a macro impact and how should we think about kind of the pace of the ability to sort of recover and accelerate that pace of net new customer has on a go-forward basis? Yeah. So when you look at it, Keith, I mean, the majority of the churn is in the smaller customers. If you remember the chart that we showed at Investor Day shows that we have to move those customers from the left to the right.
We feel really confident that we actually -- that’s actually happening and that we are getting more success with more positive signs in the Global 2000 and that’s going to continue to be our focus and that’s how the segmentation is actually set up. We will move more over time into the distribution side with the smaller customers and you should expect to see churn in smaller -- in the smaller customer market. Got it. So like the [Technical Difficulty] retention rate remains really strong, but the smaller customers that probably the customer retention rate is kind of we are seeing the impact of that on the net new customer adds? Yeah. Got it. Excellent. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please state your question. Hi. This is Chirag on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. Just one question for me around the reception of the automation platform. So how deep would you say you all are in terms of customer adoption of the overall end-to-end automation platform today within your existing customer base and largest customers when we are talking beyond core RPA use cases and how are you continuing to pursue the opportunity to go deeper? And maybe if you could call out any specific areas that are carrying more weight or seeing more demand? Thank you. Yeah. So, obviously, we feel very positive about the business platform and what we can achieve with the business platform and we see significant future positive signs in terms of the customer opportunity that we have in front of the team with existing customers to expand.
If you just look at the expansion, you can see with Bank of New York Mellon, ATA customers expanding to the full platform and we see many, many more opportunities in that space. It’s clear that solution sets like test is have -- will have a big impact and it can be a significant driver. So it’s clear that Document Understanding is a significant driver of the platform.
And we believe with our Process Mining and Task Mining, as we described with Total Quality Logistics that the broader platform is now starting to have an impact and it’s pretty clear in our customer conversations that the platform is the way to go for automation.
So we feel really strong about where we are headed. How it’s tied to our NorthStar strategy, our selection of packages or doing packages in our platform pricing. Early days, but really confident about how we have laid it out and how we are starting to execute. Yeah. This is Daniel. I would like to add that if you look from an [inaudible] perspective, our platform strategy, it allowed us to move from our traditional market of automating existing manual processes and to growing more to end-to-end process automation.
So we are the only company that has a platform that covers the entire spectrum of automation from large business processes to manual repetitive processes to even micro test that people are doing as part of their daily job. Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. It’s good to hear some of the early go-to-market initiatives here having some success and I am curious on that, how the land size on some of the new deals are comparing to before, I know it’s early, but I think the company had talked about an average land size of 15,000 to 25,000 in the past. Can you just give us any sense on how we should be thinking about the average land size under this new approach, just as you cite some of these notable new third quarter deals? Yeah. So we see progress on the land size, Bryan, we see it slightly up as we look at the numbers right now. Our focus, as we move forward, though, is just overall expansion. So what we are really excited about is that, we feel good we have a healthy pipeline.
Customers are expanding. They are expanding into multiple elements of our platform in terms of the number of ELAs, et cetera. So both the land size we see slightly up, but we see progress in terms of customers wanting more of the platform that is very tied to our strategy in terms of driving further expansion and getting into the C levels as we outlined at Investor Day. Okay. And then a follow-up on free cash flow, I heard some of the opportunistic actions you took here in the third quarter. How should we be thinking about the 4Q levels on free cash flow and just anything to be mindful there as you work through some of the restructuring actions? Yeah. We don’t guide to free cash flow just to make that clear to start. At the same time, we have talked about being roughly cash flow neutral. So when you look at the numbers, we expect to be able to -- you should expect to see that free cash flow be positive and move us closer to that neutrality in terms of that, we are on track for those areas. And then our free cash flow expansion will be the same as we move forward in terms of our commitment on profitability that we talked about earlier. Thank you. And our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first question is a multi-partner and then I had a follow-up. Rob, for you in terms of like earlier in the year, when you were putting forth some of these initiatives to optimize the business and improve execution. On the go-to-market side, I think, there was the idea that there could be some disruption, two go-to-market activities, because of the things you are doing. Ultimately, have you seen about what you had planned for in terms of disruption to ARR or the business or has it been less? And are you done with kind of like the right leadership team and the bench strength now? And then I have a follow-up. It’s difficult to disaggregate and what I feel really good about is, how we looked at testing a lot of the initiatives in the U.S. and how they came through getting the right leadership really quickly in place in the U.S. and we have seen them execute. And that’s allowed us to actually move that to other parts of the world.
It’s pretty clear our European business is in very good shape now. Mark has done a good job with the leadership team where they are actually stable. We -- they have made all the changes necessary. And then bringing Lee on in Asia-Pacific, we feel like that’s going to pay dividends as well. And we feel like we have got the framework and the formula now to actually enable the sales force to execute to the market that they face. That’s great to hear. And I guess for us -- you had, I think, called out automation suite and Automation Cloud being up triple digits on an ARR perspective. Do you think -- I mean, I know it’s still early days with those solutions. So maybe it’s just small numbers. But can you continue to grow triple digits and what would be that portion of ARR next year, just trying to understand the size and scale? Thank you. Yeah. In terms of go-forward guidance and cloud, et cetera, remember, we really drive customer choice for that with -- in terms of allowing them to decide what is their deployment method. That being said, the team’s executed well and we see a lot -- we see continued progress and excitement in the field and our customers around our cloud-first philosophy and the product releases that are coming out.
In terms of just modeling, I would say, we are consistent with what we discussed at Investor Day, and previously, in terms of modeling our go-forward cloud mix. We feel like we are in line with what we have discussed previously. Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I got a couple. To start with on the sales side. Ashim, you talked about deal sizes improving a little bit with the change in sales execution. One of the things we see often from companies, from vendors in this environment is actually trying to sell a little bit smaller, especially when the ROI and value proposition is high and has really good expansion rates. Is that an angle that you have looked at to help maybe try to address a smaller pain point initially during this challenging macro, just to get your foot in the door and then use your natural strength to expand from there? Yeah. Scott that is the natural sales process that invested at UiPath and UiPath is really good at that, right, of acquiring smaller deals. So, that continues to show positive signs for us and it’s one of the levers that we said early on, we would continue to invest in and we continue to invest in. So we completely agree with you that’s something that we will continue to drive.
We also mentioned that, we -- as we change the segmentation, we will start to use propensity and graduation and we started to see that take impact. That allows us to take a quick acquisition and start to focus on how do we expand it and so that strategy is what that we are executing and that will drive the deal sizes up.
So it’s a combination of one, it’s both, and we believe that the way that automation can play in this market with the NorthStar approach, we are well set to actually help customers also get some of the value returns for them at speed as well. Got it. Very helpful. And then kind of a follow-up along the sales side there is, what are you hearing from customers in terms of automation and RPA on the priority list today. We continue to hear positive things about the technology, and obviously, it’s great for reducing costs and macro such as this. But are you seeing any changes in terms of how customers kind of look at this priority today? I think two ways to look at it. I definitely feel like customers understand now or getting to understand how automation can help them achieve their objectives in terms of efficiencies and actually expanding it into more customer experiences, I mean, that -- what Daniel -- as Daniel described, we are really good at dealing with mundane tasks, standardizing tasks, seeing regulation. But we are also getting really good at implementing new business models that are really complex across the Board, which is the broader aspect of automation.
So we are confident that there’s a market. We are confident that the market is in front of us and we really feel good that our strategy that we launched at Investor Day is aligned to where the market is headed. Wonderful. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please state your question. Hey, guys. This is Ryan [ph] on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to go back to the vertical question from earlier. You talked about a good win in finserv. I think you talked positively about healthcare. I know those are two areas where you are prioritizing efforts, but any verticals that you would maybe call out that underperformed your expectations or surprised you from a lander expansion perspective? Yeah. So I would say we obviously saw financial services, healthcare, technology, media and telecom. I would not say I didn’t mention and maybe I should have, I think, it was in -- the government we have done -- we feel like we have really done well with the government in different departments there expanding.
So I would say, for the most part, I can’t say there’s a laggard that stands out, but there’s definitely industries where we have actually seen, obviously, stronger progress in this quarter. I don’t know, Ashim, do you -- can you think of any, I honestly can’t think of an industry that’s a laggard right now. No. I think what, I mean, we have talked about this, it’s very ubiquitous and I would even tag on to the previous question in terms of priorities. I mean we meet with CFOs. It aligns -- our platform aligns perfectly with their priorities. Rob and I actually went to a joint customer, one of the leading construction companies in the U.S. and we -- as 5 minutes, 6 minutes going into the platform were sold, we just want to now work on how do we implement this. How fast can we do it? How fast can we… How fast can we implement it. Can it help us fast. …fast and so I think that speaks to the priority and it also speaks to how ubiquitous construction as we were going through it. They themselves started rattling off use cases. Great. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please state your question. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the solutions-based selling motion that was discussed back at Forward 5. I know it’s relatively early days here, but any thoughts or updates about this strategy, any sort of solution sets that are coming together based on perhaps some of your prior experience with professional services is particularly compelling or do you have any early feedback on how customers are responding to this? Yeah. I would say, it’s too early to go to give you a broad customer feedback on that. We launched one that’s on the marketplace. One of our customers is utilizing Bank of New York Mellon is basically going to utilize the solution package to accelerate their journey. And then -- and I don’t have -- and then we have another four packages, which actually are either launched or will be launched this month, so it’s continue.
But it’s certainly helping our sales organization position and it’s certainly helping the customers understand that the solution accelerators can help their speed in terms of implementation, getting started quickly and moving faster for them.
So we feel really good about it and -- but just too early to tell you the full feedback yet. I mean, we are excited to be quite honest. We are super excited internally about it and if I could get 100 out tomorrow, I would. Okay. Thank you. I mean I am excited and looking forward to seeing what’s going to happen there. I also wanted to ask about the partnership with OutSystems as well, because there seems like a very natural alignment between what you are driving is an automation platform and what low/no-code companies are doing for their own like enterprise application development acceleration cycles. But can you perhaps expand upon a bit of that partnership there and what it is that you can perhaps accomplish with an enterprise application platform as a partner? I think there are natural synergies between a low-code/no-code application platform and low-code/no-code automation platform like we have. We have built our platform with a very open mindset. So we have our own apps platform that our automation centric and I wanted to offer our customers the ability to build even more complex, like, what we call Tier 1 type of applications.
With OutSystem, you can even build custom CRMs or healthcare, medical or ERP type of application and they are tied very well into our automation platform. So we offer, I think, really end-to-end way of imagining new businesses, as Rob said very well. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Hey, guys. Just one question for Rob. Rob, where are we in terms of the focus on selling more to the end user versus selling to IT. And to the extent that maybe in the past, it was more selling to the end user, has that created any issue with shelfware or licenses that are being in the hands of end users that now there’s perhaps more of a focus on the IT department? Yeah. Michael, this is what I would say, if you look at our focus in bringing our solution packages, platform pricing, and as Ashim just mentioned, when we talk to a CFO, we are talking about the full end-to-end spectrum of how we help them in their business.
So when I look at the concept of shelfware, for me, that’s something that we have -- we focus on, and you will see changes to compensation plans coming in next year that will actually help move that needle and ensure that we actually customers get time to revenue really quickly and that’s the focus. I mean, that’s the focus on the Global 2000 to ensure that the time to revenue is moving at a much faster rate and the whole organization is behind that. Okay. That’s it for me and congrats on a very stable and solid quarter. Great. Well, everyone, thank you for joining us today. I would like to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season here in New York, where it feels like a holiday season in the streets, the lights are out bright and we feel really good about it and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. So happy and healthy holiday season to you and your family. Thank you. And with that, we conclude today’s conference. All parties may disconnect.

And welcome to the UiPath Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelsey Turcotte, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for UiPath. Kelsey, you may begin. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today to review UiPath’s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 financial results, which we announced in our earnings press release issued after the close of the market today.
On the call with me are Daniel Dines, UiPath’s Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Rob Enslin, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ashim Gupta, Chief Financial Officer. Rob will start the discussion and then turn the call over to Daniel. After that, Ashim will review our results and provide guidance. Then we will open the call for questions.
Our earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. We will be discussing non-GAAP metrics on today’s call.
This afternoon’s call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and our financial guidance for the fiscal first quarter and full year 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements.
For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022, and other reports filed with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended January 31, 2023, to be filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
Now I’d like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter, reflecting the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives and the strength of our AI-powered Business Automation Platform.
I’d like to thank the UiPath team and our partners for their hard work and focus throughout the year, as well as our customers for placing their trust in us. Ensuring customer success every day is the foundation of our future.
ARR ended the year at $1.2 billion, driven by net new ARR of $94 million. Excluding the FX headwind of $38 million, total ARR grew 34% year-over-year.
Fourth quarter revenue was $309 million. Total revenue for the fiscal year was $1.1 billion. Excluding the full-year FX headwind of $71 million, fiscal year revenue grew 27% year-over-year.
On the bottomline, a record fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 22% drove full-year 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to 6%. We believe this strong finish to the year accelerates our path to profitability and serves as the baseline for our fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin outlook of 9.5%, an approximately 350-basis-point expansion year-over-year.
Executing a restructuring, driving efficiencies and streamlining our organization has increased our focus, enhanced business agility and leaves us well positioned to continue to expand our market share and leadership in automation. Driving growth at scale while increasing non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is central to how we manage the business.
Our Automation Platform changes how organizations operate, innovate and grow, enabling our customers to quickly see a meaningful return on investment. For example, in the fourth quarter, a North American warehouse retail chain expanded their UiPath deployment adding Task Mining and software robots to scale their automation program across more than 330 outlets.
Wins like this are a great example of how value-selling with the right sales motion expands our footprint in existing customers. This is where our new go-to-market structure that creates coverage density and our new sales tools like the Northstar model come into play.
Northstar is designed to help the team better articulate the tangible results our Automation Platform delivers, particularly to the C-suite, driving organizational focus around automation and firmly establishing UiPath as a strategic part of a customer’s digital transformation journey.
Northstar also helps the team expand deals. During the fourth quarter we closed a record number of deals over $1 million, increasing our cohort of customers with $1 million or more in ARR to 229. Customers with $100,000 or more in ARR, increased to 1,785.
The fourth quarter was a good backdrop for our February sales kick-off where we trained the team on the full platform and a variety of new tools to build intimacy with customers, sell outcomes, drive new logos, increase expansion and build scale through partners.
Looking ahead to 2024, the team is ready to go, our enterprise and corporate segmentation models have been rolled out and accounts are assigned throughout the organization. We also continue to leverage insights gleaned from our customers with a vertical sales motion.
For example, in financial services, following a successful deployment at TD Securities, TD is now expanding automation across several lines of business at the bank to help deliver improved client experiences, productivity, and efficiencies.
And, in healthcare, Quest Diagnostics selected Document Understanding over other document processing competitors because of our high level of data accuracy with both structured and unstructured data, to help them analyze and process millions of documents.
To support our vertical strategy we have introduced Solution Accelerators which serve as templates to guide customers through deployments for common use cases. We have 10 Solution Accelerators available in our marketplace, with initial offerings focused on finance, healthcare, and IT and we plan to add additional verticals.
BilledRight, a medical billing and operations company, is implementing two Solution Accelerators to automate the processing of healthcare related data into administrative systems, expecting to save over 40,000 hours annually.
Partners also benefit from the changes and investments we are making in our go-to-market resources. This includes global systems integrators, as well as more regionalized partners which not only expand our reach and scale, but are instrumental in helping customers build and execute a robust automation program.
For example, EY is helping the State of North Carolina incorporate Document Understanding and expand their automation program from COVID driven use cases to back office automations across their enterprise.
And, as we previewed at Investor Day, we are in the process of transitioning our smaller customers to our ecosystem of distribution partners, providing new sources of revenue for our partners and deeper enablement for these customers, while allowing our sales teams to focus on higher value opportunities.
Many of our partners also have very successful automation programs of their own, such as Capgemini and Ingram Micro, which expanded in the quarter as they continue to grow their internal automation programs and deliver our market leading capabilities to their client base.
And finally, you will notice we rolled out a new positioning for our brand earlier this week, which included the introduction of our new brand tagline, The Foundation of Innovation. This communicates not only the power of automation to transform businesses today, but also the potential to fundamentally change how quickly customers can move from idea to execution.
I am inspired by how much we have accomplished in our fiscal year 2023, launching our largest platform release to-date, completing the groundwork for our next phase of growth and delivering exceptional outcomes for our customers and partners. While there is always more work to do, I believe we are well positioned to drive UiPath to the next level as we enter fiscal year 2024.
With that, I will turn the call over to Daniel. Daniel? Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to echo Rob’s thanks to our team, customers and partners. You are all critical to our ongoing success. Before we move on, I’d like to add some color around this afternoon’s 8-K announcing that Chris Weber, our Chief Business Officer, is leaving UiPath. Chris will remain with us through a transition period that ends on April 30th, the last day of our first quarter. We wish him the best and thank him for everything he has done for UiPath.
Moving forward, Rob will assume leadership of our go-to-market function as part of his day-to-day Co-CEO responsibilities. As many of you know, Rob has over 30 years of sales experience at both Google Cloud and SAP where he built a strong track record of growing sales organizations at scale.
At the same time, our Co-CEO structure has freed me up to spend much more time with our research and development team, which is where my passion lies. We have a market leading platform and our talent is a major competitive differentiator for us that will continue to strengthen our position in the market. I am really excited to once again assume day-to-day leadership of the R&D team.
This streamlined organizational structure will allow us to move with even more agility and efficiency which is good for UiPath and for our customer’s growth. As we enter fiscal year 2024 I am pleased with how the teams are positioned and look forward to a strong year.
Turning to the business highlights, I am gratified by our recent placement as a leader in The Forrester Wave: Robotic Process Automation report that was published in February. Among other things, the report states that we have evolved from an RPA pure play into what we refer to as a business Automation Platform.
It also notes that we have added capabilities such as process mining, intelligent document processing, API integration and low-code app development to our product, thereby turning it into an Automation Platform.
The Forrester report also acknowledges that our investments in software-as-a-service deployments and re-architecting the product to turn it cloud-native are paying off. We ended the fiscal year with over $350 million in cloud ARR, including both hybrid and SaaS offerings.
A great example of a cloud deployed customer is Fiserv, who continues to grow and expand their automation deployment by incorporating Test Suite, Automation Hub and Process Mining to accelerate their delivery of operational excellence.
We recently released new functionality in Test Suite to make it easier to migrate assets from legacy solutions to UiPath to provide tighter collaboration for application lifecycle management and testing tools. Not only does Test Suite open a new market in application testing for us, but it helps ensure quality and resiliency which allows customers to automate faster.
A great example is Swisscom, which, after successfully implementing RPA and Test Suite in their finance, IT, HR and Customer Service departments, is rolling out automation across their entire organization to improve customer service, attract and retain talent, enhance operational efficiency and launch new growth engines in B2B with automation-as-a-service.
Our customers also benefit from real-time advances in AI. The role of AI in automation is not new for us. We have made significant investment in AI for years and from inception it has been infused into every part of our platform.
For example, we use AI to build large language models for capabilities like Document Understanding and Communications Mining, which we acquired with Re:infer. During the quarter we closed the largest Re:infer deal ever with a customer who plans to use it to interpret customer sentiment across millions of emails per year to reduce manual processing, client churn and enhance customer experience.
Coming later this year, Clipboard AI shows what AI can do for knowledge workers in their day-to-day roles. By leveraging large language models and understanding the structures of content, Clipboard AI intelligently transfers data between documents, spreadsheets and apps, eliminating the need for repetitive copy and paste. We plan to share more on this and other AI innovations at our AI summit later this month.
We have always had an open platform and believe that the power of automation is best unlocked when you can work with every application and business system including our ongoing relationship with Open AI.
Later this quarter we plan to release a preview of our GPT connector that will allow users of our low code development tools to easily utilize GPT to generate content in automations. There are countless use cases where customers can benefit from software robots that are able to write content and generate responses. Our vision is to arrive at a place where anyone can train and use AI to make their work easier and more productive.
Looking ahead, the automation market presents a massive opportunity and we remain focused on building a generational business that drives shareholder value through growth at scale, margin expansion and meaningful positive non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.
With that, I will turn it over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year over year. I also want to note that since we price and sell in local currency, FX continues to be a headwind to our results.
The tangible value automation creates is resonating with customers, particularly in a constrained environment, and while we expect ongoing macroeconomic variability and FX headwinds, we enter fiscal year 2024 positioned to execute.
Turning to the fourth quarter, ARR totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 30%, driven by fourth quarter net new ARR of $94 million. Full year net new ARR totaled $279 million. Excluding the FX headwind of $15 million, fourth quarter net new ARR totaled $109 million. For total ARR, excluding the FX headwind of approximately $38 million, total ARR grew 34%.
We ended the fourth quarter with approximately 10,800 total customers, including new logos like The Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Zoetis, Daimler and Bank of Maharashtra.
Moving on, our dollar based net retention rate for the quarter was 123%. Normalizing for FX and excluding the impact of Russian sanctions, our dollar based net retention rate was 129%. Dollar based gross retention of 97% continues to be best-in-class.
Revenue grew to $309 million. Normalizing for the FX headwind of approximately $14 million, revenue grew 12%. For the full fiscal year, we reported revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-over-year FX headwind of approximately $71 million, full fiscal year revenue grew 27%.
Remaining performance obligations increased to $894 million. Normalizing for the FX headwind of approximately $18 million, RPO grew 34%. Current RPO increased to $562.5 million.
Fourth quarter total gross margin was 87% reflecting ongoing investments in support and cloud infrastructure as we scale the business. Software gross margin was 93%.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $199.5 million. We ended the year with 3,833 total employees.
GAAP operating loss of $45 million included $99 million of stock-based compensation expense. Full year GAAP operating loss was $348 million, including $370 million of stock-based compensation.
Non-GAAP operating income was $69 million, resulting in a record fourth quarter operating margin of 22%. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $65 million or a 6% operating margin.
As Rob said, our results reflect the positive impact of our restructuring efforts combined with a continued focus on discretionary cost management and resource allocation that prioritizes higher return initiatives.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $101 million and for the full fiscal year, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was neutral, in line with our stated objective. We have a very strong balance sheet which is an important asset in the current operating environment, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Now, let me turn to guidance. For fiscal year 2024 we have maintained the topline growth rates we committed to at Investor Day and included a nominal increase as the dollar has weakened since late September.
We are also assuming the macroeconomic environment does not improve, including weakness in North America and that the sales force repositioning builds momentum as we move throughout the year.
And, finally, we have meaningfully accelerated our path to 20% plus long-term non-GAAP operating margin, as we now expect fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.5% and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 8%.
For the fiscal first quarter 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.250 billion; revenue in the range of $270 million to $272 million; non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $5 million; and we expect first quarter basic share count to be approximately 558 million shares.
For the fiscal full year 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.425 billion to $1.430 billion; revenue in the range of $1.253 billion to $1.258 billion; non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $120 million.
Before I close, I want to leave you with modeling points and our management philosophy. Starting with fiscal 2024 modeling points. We expect the year-over-year foreign exchange headwind to continue in the first quarter. First half net new ARR to be approximately $100 million. First half revenue to be approximately $555 million. Second half net new ARR and revenue to reflect similar seasonality as fiscal year 2023.
Full year non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 84%. Non-GAAP operating income to reflect similar seasonality as fiscal year 2023. And fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of approximately $100 million. Please note, we expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow to be positive for all quarters in fiscal 2024 and to follow normal seasonal patterns which ramp into the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, we started amortizing sales compensation expenses at the beginning of fiscal year 2022 which creates a 200-basis-point headwind to non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2024 relative to 2023.
Finally, we are actively managing stock-based compensation to lower dilution, which we expect to be in the range of 3% to 4% year-over-year for fiscal year 2024. Looking ahead, we anticipate to continue to calibrate the need for competitive compensation packages while reducing overall dilution.
In closing, we are committed to managing the business to the Rule of 40 plus, which we believe we can achieve given the strength of our global team, our market-leading Automation Platform, the power of our financial model and the size of our market opportunity.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the Operator. Operator, please poll for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question. Hey. Thank you. Congrats. That was a very strong finish. And the -- my question was like the last few weeks, we had a lot of news flow and news items around the advancement AI with ChatGPT, et cetera. Can you remind us please, like, how you are playing in there in terms of either doing it yourself or partnering with the other guys and how do you see the evolvement of AI for your own business? And then I have one follow-up. Thank you. Hey, Raimo. This is Daniel. Yeah. Well, it’s a little bit unusual to start talking about technology in our earnings call, but I think that’s a great sign. I am actually very excited on the progress that is happening on the field. And as you know, we are heavy users of AI and we have a really solid research and development arm around AI for the past five years.
We have kind of the best AI in the world when it comes to computer vision to understand application screens. And in this -- with this new advance in generative AI, I think, the best platform will be the most favor, because generative way, it’s basically a creator tool.
So in our case, this is going to accelerate the adoption of our platform. It’s going to help democratize the access to creating automations. And if you feel in the same time, while why you are not using the best tool out there when you can have the AI tool drive faster adoption.
So I think this combination between AI and the tool that the platform that is capable of fulfilling with AI comments, it’s a great combination and they are import to infuse -- continue to infuse generative across our platform.
I would like to emphasize the use of GPT-3 and large language models in our upcoming Clipboard AI and this is going to be a tool that cater to all business users, basically will allow everyone to transfer to -- transfer information from any source, every document to any application.
Imagine many a few dozens of fields converted transform in one step. It’s going to save tremendously in terms of productivity. And we are using a huge combination of our own AI models, GPT-3, Google, Amazon, everything that is combined there. So I am -- again, I am extremely bullish for the prospects of UiPath with adopting the generative AI technologies. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you for that Daniel and great to get from you. The other question is for Rob, with Chris leaving, like, as far as we understood, like, Chris’ role was to meet the sales more e-commerce driven to kind of have a better kind of more efficient way to go into the mid-market. Where are we on this project or his journey and how do you think that will continue or do you expect any disruptions? Thank you and congrats from me again. Yeah. Raimo, thank you. Great question. Look, first, we want to thank Chris for all the efforts you put into it. He’s done a great job with the team. Remember, we are very aligned from the very beginning on our plan with the go-to-market organization both Daniel, myself and Chris, and we are well on our way with that transformation.
So I would say there’s going to be minimum disruption to the field. We feel really good about the execution. The team is really positive about the progress we have made from Investor Day and where we continue to make and we will update up for the future.
Plus, we are reporting a significantly strong leadership team and with them reporting to me, we will feel like we can actually execute even faster, get closer to customers and deliver even more value to our customer base. Yeah. Raimo, I would like to add that, having Rob here and Rob is known to everyone that he is one of the best go-to-market leader on this planet. Having the opportunity to have Rob leading directly go-to-market in his -- as part of his day-to-day responsibilities, it’s actually a great news for us. I think we continue to streamline this company, I think this is the right size of the company right now, and we are really poised to more efficiency and to even accelerate our growth profile. Thank you. and our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Great. Thank you. This is Dion on for Keith. I want to ask on your Q1 guide. I mean it looks really healthy entering the year and so I was curious, since we already have mid-March now. Is there any color you can sort of provide on what you are seeing a few weeks into the quarter here? How is the demand environment shaping up and how are you executing out there? So, Dion, thanks for the question. We see the environment very much the way we saw it in October. And in our Q1 guide, we have actually accounted for foreign exchange, the continuing -- the continuation of foreign exchange pressure particularly in Q1.
But also just assume the same variability in the macroeconomic environment, including North America having the macro pressures as well. When we look at our pipeline, we are pleased with the continued progress on the execution of our sale -- of our positioning that Rob and Daniel talked about.
And overall, we have given an extra actual buffer of conservatism in there or a little extra buffer to account for the environment that’s there. So our philosophy has been the same. We have guided to what’s in front of us with -- while still accounting for a little buffer for the variability in the macroeconomic environment. That’s great to hear. And then maybe one more question on the net retention rate, obviously, it’s come down slightly from last quarter, but the magnitude is, obviously, way less than it was in the previous quarters. So any way you can sort of frame what you are seeing with customers, particularly among your large customers and how should we think about the net retention rate on a go-forward basis, are there any levels where we could see that stabilize? Yeah. Let me start and I will turn it over to Rob. So reported net dollar retention rate of 13%. Again, foreign exchange has pressure on that number, when you normalize for foreign exchange is actually at 128%.
And we see that our value or our incremental ARR continues to be driven by the highest propensity to -- customers with the highest propensity to invest in automation and especially in the Global 2000, Fortune 500, we have had a record number of million-dollar-plus deals, which I think is great momentum. Rob? And I would just add, I spent a lot of time in Europe and Asia in January, and I would tell you that the customer discussions are at a significant sea level discussion, the platform is resonating with customers, the brand around foundation for innovation is resonating with customers, and in this environment, I feel really good about where our product is positioned within our customer base. Excellent. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please state your question. Hey. This is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong finish to the year. Going off the prior question, are you noticing any differences in the growth and expansion of different customer cohorts. Meaning are newer customers perhaps slower at growing on the platform when compared to early adopters or vice versa, are there any trends that you might note here? Our cohorts have actually behaved pretty relatively similar, Kirk. Remember our -- the general customer journey is a land size of around 25 -- Chirag, sorry, is around $25,000 and from there we see customers expand their use cases similarly and kind of move up that curve very well.
Our -- the older the customers, that’s where you see the seven-digit and $1 million-plus deals kind of move as they have more confidence internally about their ability to scale automation and the culture moves in that direction.
Our platform also continues to help that. I think the addition -- the continued maturation of process mining, task mining, broadening with the Re:infer acquisition, our platform adds more value and so we do see more customers interested in more parts of our platform, that is helping at every stage. Yeah. And I would just add to that, we talk about growth products, but if you look at Document Understanding and the Re:infer Product Communications Mining, we are seeing really good results with customers as they expand into those products. Test Suite has had a big impact.
And I would also just say that, in an environment we are operating in right now, many of the larger customers are into, what I call, a stack consolidation. And our platform fits nicely into that process, as customers continue to figure -- find ways to innovate from the existing environment. So this is all good for our platform. Got it. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in here. Ashim, can you talk to the factors that are driving operating leverage expansion within your business and the stronger than expected margin guide… Yeah. … that give you confident in looking ahead? I think the team has done an incredible job execution. Like I think every UiPath employee understands that operating leverage from -- goes from delivering value to our customers and starts with the topline, while managing expenses and finding more ways to be efficient.
What I think we are really proud about in 2023 -- in fiscal 2023 is our ability to execute and streamline the organization in tough environments. I think we have done that. We continue to show that as we have -- as Daniel talked about in terms of streamlining the organization.
Across the Board, I think, the magic formula is you stay consistent on growth and you manage your cost. Operating leverage actually is kind of -- is just a natural result from that. When you look at fourth quarter, it speaks to that in the numbers and that’s why you see our operating margin really strong.
I do want to make a note, you also see it supported by strong free cash flow generation and I think that we look at both of those items. And we have also noted in our guidance this year that we look at every quarter to be positive from a cash flow standpoint and that’s just from working both of those muscles simultaneously. Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC. Please state your question. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results. Yeah. I wanted to look outside of U.S., could you give us a sense for the opportunities in sort of like broader EMEA and APJ, just in terms of both the land and the expand opportunity? Yeah. We are very pleased. Actually, Daniel and myself, we are in the Middle East, where we opened up our by office with his excellency, the Head of Digital Transformation in UAE. And we are very pleased with the team had their sales kick off. We are very pleased with where we are going, the talent we have in the team.
We are also starting to see, as I mentioned earlier on, significant discussions around platform with larger companies wanting to actually go all in with the UiPath from an RPA and expand into the other areas of our solution.
We have also seen significant interest in attended automation, strangely enough in markets like Denmark and Sweden, we have seen where companies want to drive employee empowerment, because they are actually having constraints in terms of resources and finding the resources we are finding significant benefits in that space. So I would say, our European team is coming along very nicely. We are cautiously optimistic about the opportunity in that space.
In the Asia-Pacific market, we have made some adjustments according to what we said at Investor Day. Lee is on Board now, probably, Lee Hawksley is on Board about three months. We have got some new leadership in India, a new leadership in Southeast Asia.
And I would say, we are at the very beginning of that, but cautiously optimistic that we can take the work that we have done in Europe and in North America, and execute pretty well in Asia-Pacific as well. Got it. Thank you. That’s super helpful. And then, Ashim, for you, you guys have a diversified base of users. But can you give us a rough sense for exposure to both sort of the tech and financial services vertical? Yeah. I mean on the banking financial vertical is a strong vertical for us. We have talked about -- we have given some of those figures, historically, we don’t disclose them on a quarterly basis, but they are one of our largest segments, financials and health care.
Just to qualify a little bit, when we look at the exposure, like, it’s kind of we have evaluated it. A lot of our major customers are in the large institutions, like, JPMorgan, like, some of the major banks that are out there. And so, with that, we feel really good about our position of where we are there right now. I would just add to the financial services. I mean, when you look at the opportunity to have drive efficiencies in financial services I think we had a tremendous amount of value in that. We see our solution sets like Document Understanding having huge benefits in healthcare and in insurance because of the straight through document processing that we can achieve and the results. With our Northstar value proposal is having a difference in financial services, insurance and healthcare. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please state your question. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on margin first. So can you just bridge what you did in 4Q here, the strong 20% plus value planned out for fiscal 2024 and specifically, if you can maybe talk about the areas of cost efficiency that you benefited most from here in 4Q? And then any of those benefits that don’t recur initially in 2024 or areas that you are leaning back in to invest? Yeah. I think the -- I will always emphasize. I think our operating margin starts with delivering in the topline. which we have all of our teams focused and we have this market in front of us that allows us to deliver numbers like the revenue number we did.
Bryan, in terms of the specific cost areas, I -- frankly, we had cost productivity across the Board and I really want to just emphasize. I think from product and engineering to G&A to sales and marketing, every team has contributed in the right way.
Most of what we have seen, like everything that we have realized, we look at that as something that is recurring. There are some -- always some timing elements that go into a quarter such as sales commissions accruals, those types of things that have some accounting associated with it in terms of seasonality.
But all of the efficiencies that we have seen in terms of rationalizing organizations, streamlining organizations, finding productivity and discretionary costs. Those are things we see as sustainable as we go forward and that’s why we feel really good and confident about the 350 basis points that we are expanding the year even off of a higher beat in the fourth quarter from where we ended. Okay. And then on the product, Daniel, can you talk about client appetite that you have seen around discovery products and I heard a reference customer there, I think, around Communications Mining. So I am curious how you would compare the uptake of that product versus what you saw in the past around Task Mining and Process Mining when you brought those to market? It has become very clear in the last year, I’d say that, the discovery pillar is an essential part of a full-fledged Business Automation Platform. And we are making steady progress, first of all, in Process Mining. We have released a great version on the cloud. And we are really bullish on our prospects on being sizable player in the Process Mining market.
We have been one of the first company to invest in Task Mining and this is one of the most ambitious AI project that we have ever attempted. And the new transformer-based models give us even better hopes into getting more of the Task Mining. To a quick reminder, what we are trying to achieve is basically watching over the shoulder people doing business processes by AI configuring how the processes themselves.
And Communication Mining, it’s our latest addition to the platform by acquiring Re:infer. It’s again, it’s a large language model based on transformers. We have seen great traction, especially with our -- some of our large customers, especially banking customers that use our Communications Mining technology to classify millions of emails and taking action based on the email.
So, again, this shows the power of an integrated platform. You discover and then you automate, and ultimately, you operate. To me, it’s again, it’s a great point that our bet three years, four years ago on this platform is becoming successful today. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please state your question. Hey. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Much appreciated. In terms of just the growth guide, Ashim, we can appreciate that there have been a lot of improvements that you have put in place you are guiding for 10% up to 18% for the full year on the topline. Can you just maybe level set how much of the growth improvement comes from some of the go-to-market and product changes we have been talking about since the Investor Day versus the math of lapping some of the headwinds you have experienced and just how to think through the progression there? Yeah. So, maybe just as I start, I think, we finished fiscal year 2023 at 19% revenue growth and we encountered a significant FX headwind in 2023. So that helps to level off, Michael. So adjusted for that actually we feel -- we -- we feel like it was a good growth -- a good delivery in 2023.
That being said, when we look at our guidance philosophy, we talked about 18% at Investor Day. We accounted for the weakening dollar within our guidance. We adjusted and put an additional buffer for the foreign -- for the macroeconomic volatility or variability that we see in front of us and then we accounted for the repositioning and the execution time line that Rob has outlined. So when you take that all together, we actually -- we feel good about our guidance in 2024 and we continue to guide to see what we have in front of us with those qualifications. Yeah. And I -- this is Kelsey. I want to step in quickly. We gave a lot of very specific modeling points in the script, which I think will be very helpful to you as you put your models together tonight.
So we will post all of that information on our prepared remarks to the website as soon as we are finished tonight and if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us, but I think this will help you put your FY 2024 model together. That’s very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on margins. I mean, obviously, the Q4 margin results are strong and stand out. The expansion targets for the year are in line with the targets that were presented at the Investor Day. Still strong expansion, but with the second round of cost reduction that went into place in November, were those something that was contemplated alongside the Investor Day targets or can you just help us understand if there are areas of reinvestment on the product side or other things that you are also contemplating that keep the range in a similar state even with the second reduction? Yeah. I think, net-net, we look at we look at keeping our workforce relatively stable. We don’t see any major investments or major decreases at this time, and so overall, I think we have factored our actions from last year into this year.
Now are there areas that we invest in? Yes and that’s why we continue to look for opportunities to streamline the organization, and every UiPath employee continues to look for areas of efficiency together, particularly, in our discretionary spend. So that’s kind of how we have looked at it.
I would say all of our actions have been baked in. We will invest in the areas needed to execute and to continue to take advantage of the market, the opportunity that we see in front of us. But we feel like we can relatively fun not to keep the size of the organization relatively similar. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Audi Wu [ph] for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to call in the past six months to nine months, both for UiPath and a lot of other vendors, we have heard that customers are kind of really kind of slowing down and trying to pick the right tools and then kind of going all in on them and you guys have been kind of focusing on the post sales motion. So some of the success we are seeing clearly in your results just from those changes you guys have made to the sales? Yeah. I mean, I think, we laid out very clearly that at Investor Day, where we were going, what we were going to do around pricing, packaging, the segmentation of the organization, the execution around the growth products and delivering on the platform and we feel like we have executed really, really well around that.
With the environment, part of the question, Audi is, if the environment hasn’t changed, we kind of were cautiously -- cautious about the environment and we have continued to focus on driving the forecasting at the right approach, making certain that our investments are focused on the right level that we are actually connecting to the C level customers and that were actually part of their budgeting cycle and that’s what we are focused on and I think that’s paying dividends.
But I’d also just say as well, when we launched 23.10 [ph], which was the technology platform, that allowed us to be competitive in the discovery area and we absolutely are starting to see some real traction with these Document Understanding and the Re:infer product in the marketplace.
I would say that our customers are looking for an Automation Platform is what I have said from the very beginning. Automation is an important aspect to every customer’s journey, and if you want to move with speed and agility, you need Automation and we feel like we are clearly the leader in Automation Platform space. Great. Thanks for the answer there. And then just, ultimately, on the -- in terms of contract renewals, any patents to call there, any trends we should watch for as we go through fiscal 2024? I don’t see any, we feel like we are on top of contract renewals. We don’t see any significant changes in the contract renewals. Our customers -- we continue to focus on expansion, as well as a key aspect for customer -- that are existing customers and we will continue to drive expansion. We think we have significant upside in the existing customer base as well. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Wonderful. Thank you. I wanted to ask if you could provide an update as to which of those solutions that you are selling into under the new go-to-market are you seeing success. Obviously, some big changes to more solution selling approach. I would love to get any color as to which verticals or solutions are you starting to see success with, which one should we see as more up and coming? Thank you. Yeah. Hi, Brad. Good question. Document Understanding is we, I mentioned it earlier, Document Understanding, we are seeing significant traction in Document Understanding. The value proposition around it is very clear, it’s almost crystal clear in terms of the value customers can receive. Our straight through processing is really high and so when you have customers that have significant invoice or payment systems or claims payment systems, we see significant value in that.
At Test Suite we are seeing value in that. That’s actually very unique in an Automation space. There’s nobody that connects testing with Automation, so that’s significant. And then companies like E&Y where they have used Process Mining solution with the audit practice and we have seen process there.
What I would say, overall, though, is we are seeing more and more companies start to look at the platform as an opportunity, enterprise license agreements are becoming more significant in the discussion. We are having a lot more discussions with customers look and say, when you look at their full stack can your Process Mining, Task Mining, Document Understanding, can it replace many of these other applications in a platform, make it more consistent, easier to implement, faster to implement. And then on top of that, I would say, our solution accelerates are actually starting to have an impact as well as we help customers achieve the Automation results much faster. Thank you. Next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please state your question. Yeah. Thanks. I will give it to one question, but I can’t help myself. I really do appreciate Ashim all the color on the first half and second half. Hopefully, our model won’t be so out of whack going forward then. It’s very helpful. I guess, Rob, for you, the question I would have is, you got a lot on your plate in terms of the go-to-market efforts and now you are kind of taking the role as Chief Business Officer as well, so you got a time on your plate. But what about partners? I know at the low end, partners are important to like kind of over first-line customer kind of engagement. But these global SIs or the regional boutiques or the ISVs, it seems like with some of these products like Document Understanding, I mean, you have a really good opportunity to really partner together and drive a lot of incremental revenue. So what are you doing or what are some guideposts on partner side of this go-to-market transformation you are working on? Thank you. Yeah. Good question. So we -- I think we -- I believe we made significant progress with partners like E&Y. I was on the Automation, the Worldwide Automation, I guess, event yesterday with E&Y, which is touching, I think, five or six markets around the world, over 1,200 of the customers there.
When we are talking about how Automation can help deal with inflationary aspects, different economic disruption that customers are taking -- take labor arbitrage and so on. So I feel like we are making significant progress with partners like E&Y.
I would also say with Accenture, we are making progress. They continue to be fully supportive, incredible opportunities in Europe as well with Accenture and we are starting to see that play through and many of the others are also now starting to see Automation as a big play.
When you look at how a partner sees the Automation space. In the past, they saw it in terms of many different products, many different types of solutions trying to solve and now they UiPath as a go-to player in the Automation space to help drive customers. And there’s nothing that can drive business results faster than Automation. You can get it often and you can get it on top of many other solutions. So it’s non-disruptive in many ways.
And in my discussions in Europe, as I said, I have started to see a significant amount of discussion as well, not only in terms of those discovery or those growth products, but also in terms of attended automation to solve constraints in the healthcare environment and how they are dealing with different levels of labor shortages in those markets. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Hey. This is Billy on for Michael. Just wanted to ask how you are thinking about new versus expansion going into next year? Thank you. Yeah. We have kind of -- I would just assume the same split that we have historically had, which is the 70-30 split for our net new ARR. That’s the assumption, I think, we continue to have and it’s been fairly. Yeah. I would just add to that. There was a question earlier around e-commerce and distribution. We are distribution partners. I should have answered this, our distribution partners are actually investing more in markets and they are actually starting to see bigger upside opportunities in that space. So we feel positive about the acquisition of customers as well.
And remember, we always said that, we were going to focus on creating a highly efficient density model as well, which fits the customers that want to expand into the platform area and with our new growth products as well. Thank you. Next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please state your question. Hi, everyone. I will certainly echo congrats on the strong quarter. I guess one question I am going to ask is on the Solution Accelerators now that they have been in the market for a little while. What’s the ARR trends on those like relative to maybe how you sold the platform historically. I just didn’t know if you have seen any changes either up or down in terms of how you are able to land with those versus landing without them? Thanks. Yeah. So, good -- so, Scott, on that, I would say, we now -- I think between 10 and 16 Solution Accelerators are in the market. We are seeing significant uptake on them in -- on the marketplace, sorry and we are seeing significant uptake on the Solution Accelerators.
As I said very earlier and we will continue to bring them out is the speed at which customers are using them. They are driving the bigger opportunities that we are working on. We don’t actually charge for Solution Accelerators, but we are definitely seeing that they are benefiting us, as we help customers drive enterprise license agreements, how they want to use it and the speed at which we can accelerate them. So they are certainly helping the sales cycle and helping customers get faster return to value. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks. Yeah. This is Robert here. I just want to thank everybody. I appreciate your time and I really look forward to spending time with many of you over the next couple of weeks from Daniel, myself and Ashim and Kelsey. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us as always.
I want to take a moment to thank our team and partners for everything you do, to make UiPath successful, and our customers for placing their trust in us. It was a good start to the fiscal year with first quarter results reflecting our commitment to driving growth at scale, coupled with increasing profitability and cash flow.
While the broader environment continues to be variable, the level of engagement with prospects and momentum in our large customers gives us confidence, in the strategic role automation will continue to play in digital transformation. Turning to the numbers. We ended the quarter with ARR of $1.249 billion, an increase of 28%, driven by a net-new ARR of $45 million. Excluding FX headwind of $6 million, net-new ARR totaled $51 million.
First quarter revenue was $290 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue was $297 million and grew 21% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin increased from negative 4% in the first quarter of last year, to positive 17% in the first quarter of this year. A significant acceleration of our path to the 20% plus long-term operating target, we laid out at Investor Day.
I am very pleased, with the progress we are making to better align the team to customer requirements and the resulting efficiency improvements. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, was a first quarter record of $73 million.
The first time we delivered positive non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, at the outset of the year. We ended the quarter with approximately 10,850 customers, reflecting our focus on acquiring customers with the highest propensity to invest in automation.
New customers included Liberty Bank, New York City Health and Hospitals, Vermont Federal Credit Union and Navia Benefit Solutions. And we are seeing good momentum in our large customers, customers with $1 million or more in ARR increased 43% year-over-year, to 240. While customers with $100,000 or more in ARR, increased to approximately 1,860.
Customers choose UiPath, because of our market-leading technology and breadth of platform capabilities, which allows to stock consolidation, vendor rationalization and accelerate ROI. Helping them achieve speed and agility, while driving efficiency and improving employee and customer experiences.
For example, Colgate Palmolive, with more than 70 automation across various departments, they expanded to broader platform capabilities in the first quarter, as they migrate to an integrated platform. Consolidate vendor spend and utilize our governance capabilities.
And with Silica, which started the UiPath journey with Test Suite, expanded to additional platform capabilities, as they look to improve cost saving, productivity and employee and customer experiences.
It has been a busy start to this fiscal year, we launched a new segmentation model, nearly doubled the number of solution accelerators, added SAP solution accelerators to complement our partnership, hosted our annual AI Summit for a record number of participants, introduced our next platform release 2023.4. And announced several strategic partnerships and strengthened our Board and management team.
We also recently hosted two incredible events, our first-ever UiPath Summit an exclusive event for our digital C-Suite and most forward-thinking customers and our UiPath Together public sector event in Washington. There were two clear takeaways. Our platform is driving meaningful ROI for our customers and they want to understand how they can leverage the UiPath's Platform, to deliver the power of generative AI, responsibly and at scale.
Since inception, our platform has been infused with AI. We offer our customers best-in-class models, re-communications, understand documents and see screens and interfaces. Coupled with this next wave of generative AI, we can help customers make automation even more accessible, across their employees and significantly expand use cases. Equally as important, our automation platform provides the guarantees, guardrails and governance our customers require to deliver generative AI safely.
We are investing like the market, we are moving fast. Which, Daniel will talk about in a few minutes. AI is not new to UiPath. We are delivering real value to our customers today. During the quarter, [indiscernible] a UiPath customers since 2022, decided to replace a competitor and migrate the entire automation program to us, with a strategic focus on AI, as they work to accelerate development and deliver better governance. We also purchased Document Understanding for process invoices and plan to roll it out across other use cases.
Another great example is Hyundai Capital, which is innovating the car buying experience for Genesis, Hyundai and Kia dealerships. And the customers by leveraging Document Understanding to streamline the loan and lease process. Reducing the time it takes to fund a loan, translates into a better experience for both the dealership and the customer. And we see level sponsorship.
They are exploring additional opportunities to further streamline their organization and drive efficiencies to the bottom line, using AI and UiPath automation. Our partner ecosystem also continues to play a critical role in our success. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with Snowflake, launching a pre-built solution for the Manufacturing Data Cloud to instantly connect data to business processes without using complex code. These technical integrations enhance our customers' ability to seamlessly integrate across applications.
In addition, go to market partners expand our reach to customers, in a scalable and cost-effective manner. A great example is KION, the German multinational and UiPath customer since 2019, working with PwC, KION continues to scale across the organization as they look to incorporate AI and Test Suite into the automation program.
We also recently announced a partnership with T-Systems, a Trusted Cloud Provider as classified by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy to deliver our end-to-end platform at scale to public sector organizations and large enterprises across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. As part of this partnership, we plan to work with T-Systems to develop industry-specific offerings to joint customers.
One of the first of this Deutschlandticket, with T-Systems and UiPath anticipate helping them manage demand for the new flat rate transport ticket in Germany. And finally, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP, to jointly offer automation capabilities to customers. This partnership will help enterprises build a clean core, on S/4HANA Cloud, which complements SAP fold process automation, enabling organizations to improve efficiency and productivity across SAP and non-SAP workloads.
We are pleased to be the premium sponsor for all three of SAP SAPPHIRE events, in Orlando. Barcelona and Sao Paulo. And tomorrow, I will join the ASAP team on stage at Sapphire, Barcelona to underscore the partnership, we now have in-place. Our partner is also very excited about the announcements. [indiscernible] E&Y's Americas Vice-Chair has told us that having two alliances within the EY ecosystem that leverage the strength of the UiPath automation platform to help clients drive even more value from the SAP investment, makes a lot of strategic sense.
There is a significant amount of inbound interest and I'm convinced that together we can help customers achieve game-changing results. In summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives, which are raising our profile and relevancy not only with our customers but also with go-to-market and technical partners.
That being said, we are mindful of ongoing macroeconomic variability and we have more work to do, extending our market leadership, helping customers get the most out of automation, and continuing to improve our execution.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Daniel. Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon everyone.
We are very excited to have introduced our newest platform release 2023.4, earlier this month. This release further accelerates our customers' ability to discover, automate and operate at scale, and continues to expand our leadership position in UI, AI and API automation. Our customers are very excited about this new release and our plans to use generative AI to further increase adoption of our platform.
We believe that generative AI will be a very important part of our enterprise AI foundation, along with domain specific AI and automation. And it is our platform that will allow us to deliver in a secure and governed manner, that Enterprise customers require. Generative AI, it's very powerful, but by itself has a limited scope of capabilities in the enterprise, it can read and generate tax, but not take action.
AI without automation, is like a brain without a body. However, when AI is combined with an enterprise automation platform, it opens a whole new set of use cases and opportunities for customers. Our software robots can already read screens and documents and now with generative AI, they can answer customer emails, create summaries of complex documents and respond to support questions.
Customers can use these new generative skills to extend existing automation, in areas such as customer service and imagine entirely new ones. We also believe that generative AI will democratize access to our platform, making it easier for both knowledge workers and developers, to create automation using just natural language descriptions. Generative AI will upskill every employee.
One of our biggest competitive advantages in leveraging the power of generative AI, is our long-term investment in AI computer vision. With computer vision we understand screens, from legacy to modular and applications and our knowledge of screens continues to grow exponentially with more than 2 million calls every day to our AI computer vision service in the UiPath automation cloud.
We are uniquely able to combine this understanding of screens, with the cognitive intelligence of generative AI, to watch what happens, understand what's being done, and automated it in our enterprise-ready platform. Let me show you a quick video of a research project, codenamed Wingman, that we are currently working on, which illustrates this. If you are not on the webcast. Please go to our Investor Relations website for the link.
[Video Presentation]
This shows how generative AI and computer vision can create robust workflows without writing any code. As this technology matures from research into products, we expect to extend the capabilities beyond developers to knowledge workers, who will be able to simply describe tasks in natural language and have them execute it directly by our platform.
At our FORWARD IV User Conference in the fall of 2021, I described the potential of generative AI, using the phrase, semantic automation. I am very pleased to report that our first offering in this space, Clipboard AI, is now in preview. Clipboard AI intelligently transfers data between documents, spreadsheets and apps, understanding the content and automatically inserting the data into the right places.
This use case has the power to transform how people work, and this is made possible by the depth of our expertise in combining AI computer vision, our own domain-specific models, and generative AI. Generative AI, also creates a compelling opportunity in automating manual tests. Today application testing often still requires manual intervention, which makes it slow, unresponsive and highly repetitive.
The opportunity for a combination of generative AI and computer vision, prompted through natural language descriptions and delivered through our platform, has the potential to meaningfully transform the testing market and we are well-positioned to execute here. Generative AI, represents a massive opportunity for UiPath and I am working closely with the team and our customers, as we infuse it across our platform to realize its potential.
This is why I'm so excited to welcome Karenann Terrell, to our Board of Directors, as a former practitioner with C-Level technology roles at GSK, Walmart, Baxter International and Daimler Chrysler, Karenann brings a wealth of experience and customer perspective. Which I believe will benefit the entire company.
Before I close and hand the call over to Ashim, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to your UiPath's success. We remain focused on building an enduring Rule of 40 company and are pleased that our first quarter represents another step on that journey.
With that, I will turn it over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone.
Unless otherwise indicated I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year-over-year. I also want to note that since we price and sell in local currency, fluctuations in FX rates impact results.
We continued to execute against our strategic imperatives of balanced growth and profitability, which resulted in first quarter revenue -- first quarter revenue outperformance, as well as record non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.
As a result, we are meaningfully increasing both our full year non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow outlook, this afternoon. Turning to the first quarter, ARR totaled $1.249 billion, an increase of 28%. Driven by a net-new ARR of $45 million, excluding the FX headwind of $6 million, net-new ARR totaled $51 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 10,850 customers, including great new logos like Asda, Jubilant Life Sciences, Robert Weed Corporation, TaskRabbit and TNL. As Rob mentioned, we saw strength in large customers as they continued to increase their UiPath footprint, with broader platform adoption and increased consumption. A great example is TetraPack, a customer since 2018, who continues to expand on our platform adding additional products this quarter like, Document Understanding, Action Center and Automation Hub as they migrate to the cloud.
Our strategy is to focus on customers with a higher propensity to invest in automation, as we transition our smaller accounts to a distribution channel. AI is also a central part of our strategy and is infused across our platform. A great example is Canon USA working with Green -- is Canon, USA, working with GreenLake Consulting Canon has built an automation program that leverages Document Understanding and customized machine-learning models to process over 5,000 invoices each month. Automation, gives them greater accuracy and efficiency, and requires far less need for human interaction, saving their employees over 6,000 hours of manual work annually.
Our dollar-based net retention rate for the quarter was 122%. Normalizing for FX, our dollar-based net retention rate was 127%. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best-in-class. Revenue grew to $290 million. Normalizing for the FX headwind of approximately $7 million, revenue grew 21%. Remaining performance obligations increased to $904 million, up 34% percent year-over-year. FX-adjusted, RPO was $891 million. Current RPO increased to $559 million.
Turning to expenses, we delivered a strong first quarter total gross margin of 87%. The software gross margin was 93%. First quarter operating expenses were $205 million, reflecting disciplined cost control. We continue to find opportunities to optimize the business, which allows us to both reinvest in growth, and increase profitability.
We have built a strong foundation to scale the company, and we'll continue to leverage automation and improve operational excellence, to grow the business efficiently. Before I move on, please note the year-over-year decrease in G&A reflects both cost efficiencies, as well as the reallocation of software expenses to other line items. GAAP operating loss of $46 million included $85 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Non-GAAP operating income was $48 million, resulting in a record first quarter operating margin of 17%. The combination of revenue outperformance and disciplined expense management, resulted in record first quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow at $73 million. I am very pleased with this achievement, and we expect to be non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow positive, every quarter for the remainder of the year. We also have a strong balance sheet, which is an important asset in the current operating environment, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Now let me turn to guidance, which assumes the overall macroeconomic environment continues to be variable including in North America and that we are in the midst of executing our new go-to-market strategy, which includes account segmentation and the transition of smaller customers to distribution partners.
For the fiscal second quarter 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.301 billion dollars to $1.306 billion. Revenue in the range of $279 million to $284 million. Non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $10 million. And we expect the second quarter basic share count to be approximately 563 million shares.
For the fiscal full year 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.4271 billion to $1.432 billion. Revenue in the range of $1.267 billion to $1.272 billion. Non-GAAP operating income, to be approximately $168 million. This translates to a non-GAAP operating margin of 13%, a 700 basis-point increase year-over-year. Before I close, I want -- I want to leave you a few final details. First, given our first quarter gross margin outperformance, we now expect gross margin for fiscal year 2024 to be 85%.
And finally, we expect fiscal year 2024, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, of more than a $160 million or 13% adjusted free cash flow margin. Looking forward, the team remains focused on delivering growth at scale in a disciplined manner, which allows us to both invest in extending our market leadership while expanding operating margin and increasing adjusted free cash flow.
Thank you for joining us today and we look-forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter. With that. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please state your question. Hi, this is Joe Meares on for Terry. Thanks for taking the questions I appreciate it. So, you recently announced your new business automation platform with SAP. It sounds like a big deal to us. Can you just explain what drove the decision to make this integration and what you think the opportunity is here? Hi Terry, this is Robert here. Thank you for the question. Look, with I'm here in Barcelona with many of SAP's customers and it's a truly exciting event for us. We are the key sponsors in both Orlando, Barcelona and Sao Paulo. Well, I think basically in terms of the customer, a large global apparel, footwear company this morning in Barcelona mentioned why the partnership for them is important.
And it's basically around the ability to migrate to S/4HANA, drive a clean core, accelerate their digital transformation, combining some of SAP's technologies around Signavio, which is process modelling, connected with our UiPath task mining, and driving of the UiPath platform together that global footwear, apparel company is working with robots over a couple of 1,000 hours, where a SAP system seeing a significant benefit, together with customers wanting to move faster, customers want to actually see how automation on top of their existing environment, whether they're actually going to go through digital transformation or not and we believe that.
Our go-to-market organizations on both sides will be able to deliver the value to these customers, much, much faster. So it's a significant partnership. The feedback we got from global systems integrators has been exceptionally positive, we've mentioned a couple of them. And we've had a lot of positive inbound interest in this partnership with SAP. To get it, today we also have customers that already utilize us in the Test Suite capabilities we have, you can see as we've mentioned previously, with Orica and the benefit they've got out of it.
So, we think at the end of the day, customers are going to see the significant benefits acquired by connecting ERP systems, world-class mission-critical ERP systems, together with world-class automation systems. Super helpful. And then just as a follow-up. We recently saw UiPath product demonstration that used ChatGPT to come up with test scenarios for the Test Suite, it seems very additive to the platform. Can you just explain, at a high-level how ChatGPT augments the product and then what your product does that ChatGPT cannot do? Thanks so much. We're very excited about the opportunities that generative AI is going to bring to our platform. We are seeing good opportunity to increase the adoption of our platform by making the existing use cases easier to implement and democratizing access to the platform. In the sense that even more-and-more less technical users can use it.
We are building as part of this project, codename Wingman. We are building a co-pilot like technology, where users can specify in natural language -- the task they want to automate and we use our computer vision to read the application screens, and by combining our own technology with the cognitive power of ChatGPT, we can actually create very easy-to-use workflows that can be deployed on run by our platform.
Moreover, we feel that in our Document Understanding business, we can accelerate the creation of domain-specific models, by training them, using generative AI. But then deploy them in a secure and governed manner. So this domain-specific model has the advantage that they are very precise and they don't they don't pause business risks. And you mentioned testing.
Explorative testing was very difficult traditionally to automate, because people if very fast through building an application and user interface, usually changed quite a lot, but now we see the opportunity to have a description of the tests in pure English, like you would do for a manual test and then by our automation platform that employs, computer vision and generated a will simply explore the user interface and will be capable of Understanding and application testing for more like a human user.
That will result in an acceleration of actually implementing a large application, because people will test, much more often. So development cycles, will shorten. So only once we believe this is an amazing opportunity for our platform and I want to stress again, that the power of it really puts into highlights the power of our computerization that reads screens, the power of our execution platform that can execute screens through applications and the power of our end-to-end platforms that can orchestrate and deliver automation in the enterprise great manner. Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Raymond Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question. Thank you and congrats for the numbers on the quarter guys. I wanted to stay on that testing theme and actually the SAP theme from the first question. And I'm thinking about testing in a SAP migration environment because as a lot of customers have to go to S/4HANA lot of customers need to be done and we think that customizations, et cetera, should be like a significant opportunity for you guys around testing there and work there and. Am I dreaming or do you see that and what's the opportunity there? And I have one follow up, question for Ashim. Yes, Robert here. When you when we mentioned the [Arcata suite] announcement earlier, that is in combination with S/4HANA migration, that they are doing so an integral part of that migration, and it was also automation on top of -- On top of S/4HANA migration. So we actually have customers today that actually utilizing significant parts of both platforms. And the opportunity is significant because it also ties in the SAP's BTP platform together with a slow migration.
So that's why we feel really confident about it. We also feel like it changes the discussion in front of customers and it drives a significant amount of efficiency in the migration process as well. We've also deliver heat maps and ICT solution accelerators to help move that motion even fact. So we do see that as a significant opportunity with our partner SAP. Yes, okay, perfect, makes sense. And then Ashim great results on cost control and what you're doing there. How do we how do you think about your cadence investment cadence here for the remainder of the year in terms of kind of controlling costs, but also kind of getting ready for in case things are kind of looking better in the second half of the year with a view on 2024, like how do you kind of run the business at the moment. Many thanks. Yes. I think first is, we are world consistently invest in areas that we see opportunity, Raimo, that is both in the go-to-market side as well as in-product and you can see that in the results of the roadmap, you know that Daniel talked about in the product and the excitement that we have there. And things like that and. Deals like the SAP partnership that happens through the investment of time of our resources. So we focused people in the right places with the highest return. We've talked about it, I think we have enough scale now. We're a big chunk of our base is really scalable globally. You look at our G&A structure.
I think we've built the foundation to scale across every single country and support the customers and the strategy that's in place today. And on the go to-market side. Rob brings a ton of expertise and the leadership of the go-to-market teams really are constantly looking for the best opportunity and focusing on customers with the highest propensity to invest, automatically leads to better ROI's in terms of the investments, we put it so well. I think that we will continue to operate the company efficiently, that efficiently for us means investing in great opportunities and de-emphasizing areas where we don't and that formula.
I think has shown positive results. But you could buy, you can see, not just the generation of free-cash-flow, but also us raising our overall operating margin guidance here to 13% for the remainder of the year. Yes, okay, makes sense. Well done. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC. Please state your question. Great guys, thanks for taking my questions. Rob, maybe I'll start with you. Upselling the platform beyond RPA is clearly a big opportunity for you guys. And when we look at your growth in large customers, it seems like it's showing up there. Can you talk a little bit more about the success you're seeing there moving customers beyond RPA to the broader platform. And what does that do to air ARR per customer? Yes, and maybe Ashim can comment on the ARR per customer, but certainly when you look at our customers above one million, that's improving all the time. I would say, Matt, the discussions we're having with customers today using our Northstar model. It's significant, it's really around how we can help businesses, how can help drive efficiency and how we can help them deal with this environment that we're working in today.
So we see we see lots of opportunity that. I think Daniel mentioned Document Understanding, the return on Document Understanding, the results we have with customers today in healthcare, healthcare providers and financial institutions, is absolutely significant and we see more-and-more customers expand.
And then as customers' started to see areas if they. I would say, when we engaged in a sales cycle and it's and we with Test Suite and I looked at the full platform. We're seeing more-and-more customers select us because of the platform, the opportunity that it provides so. I would say, RPA in automation. Today the enterprise version of the way the companies look at enterprise automation UiPath is clearly the leader in that space. The partnerships that we've now going place with big GSIs and big technical part is making a big difference. And I'm very confident of where we're headed with our focus on industries and these partnerships. Great, thanks. Maybe just Ashim following-on Raimo's question on margins, obviously, super impressive from 9.5% to now 13% for the year you just sort of curious when we think about that longer-term margin progression. How should we think about the cadence? Beyond this year, which is obviously been pretty dramatic this year so-far. Yes. I think we're really pleased with the progress and the pace of execution by every single employee of UiPath, frankly. Working to both serve our customers and find efficiencies together. We've talked about 20% margin, in terms of a long-term operating margin goal, we will update that at the appropriate time as we see the need to, but we're more than halfway there. We feel really good about that progress. We're committed to being a Rule of 40 company, and I think just continuing and continuing that progress is what we're focused on. Thank you very much. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Hi, this is Arti on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, is there any material portion of your pipeline where you look at it, you feel like you're being involved in generative AI and LLM with external products? To be clear, I understand you guys have your own AI and LLM products. But specifically if kind of thing. Any incremental pipeline with adoption of these kind of emerging LLM. Thanks. So I don't think we look at our pipeline in that vein. When we go-around and we Rob can talk through the customer portion and the customer stories -- every customer's and our pipeline reflects the continued interest in understanding their automation and AI go hand-in-hand and the power of generative AI really makes us the right long-term fit for their platform.
So we see that in the pipeline in terms of just the continued throughput of the deals and the deals with our largest customers reflecting our strategy. So that's the way we see it, do we have a specific set of pipeline or deals just around AI, we don't look at it that way and. I don't believe our customers do either. Yes. Let me just add to that, because. I think it's really important and. I think Daniel - in Daniel's prepared remarks, I thought it came across really well. When you look at the way we look at enterprise, AI, and we are getting a significant amount of discussions with our customers. You have to go back to domain-specific AI and domain-specific AI we've had. years, years of work-in this space that our customers, whether it be task mining Document understanding our computer vision technology. And don't forget Communications Mining as well.
So we've got years of understanding in that we spoke about clipboard AI previously on generative AI customers really want to understand how we can benefit them in the future with automation and how these two go hand-in-hand. And I think that's going to be something that UiPath will continue to evolve really-really fast in the next month. I would believe that we are seen as a leader in a thought leader in this space as well. I mean, Daniel, do you want to make some comments on that? Yes, as I said, it's. I really believe that from a strategic standpoint, AI development will follow a bit like our human brain development. We have so very powerful cognitive engine. But we have a lot of specialized. those, if I can say so help us to do many task on autopilot. For instance, if I try to look at Deniz initially. I am training using my cognitive understanding of the game, but then I will play on autopilot because it's much more effective, it's more precise, it's actually much less intensive in terms of resources that it requires.
So obviously, this is going to be the module that will prevail in the enterprise world and a. This is why I believe we have an extensive mode here with based on our computer vision technology and actually our ability to execute actions on screens, which is a very hard thing to do, reliably. So it's part of our IP for the last 15 years in a way I. I really believe that generative way it's exactly the missing piece, RPA to really go to the next level of adoption. Got it. That was a very insightful thoughtful answer from all of you. So I'll just leave with that. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Yes, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. I wanted to start first with. Ashim in terms of the demand environment, you guys talked about sustained deal scrutiny, similar to last quarter. As you look into the trends in May and look into the pipeline for the rest of the year. How are like, what is sort of the customer buying behavior, how is that shaping up. Any sort of changes you see in May versus what you've seen in Q1 and what you saw in Q4? No. I think it reflects just the way that we've described it, which is, it's it reflects the variability of the macroeconomic environment. That. I think it goes changes every single day and we're attuned to that with our customers, but there is no consistent change that we see a major difference in from that perspective. Is there any sort of regional variation? This there. Some inkling that Europe might be doing better than the U.S. and Asia, or is it still pretty volatile across the various geographies. So just in terms of what I see and I'll let Rob comment on. He has then with the customers, but from a pipeline perspective, we're really pleased with and the execution within across our teams. I think the word variable really is a global phenomenon. In terms of the overall environment. I think well. You know for a longer period of time. Just since last year and. I think North America is something we commented on. In in the last earnings call.
So from that, those are just the dynamics and I'd say that's pretty consistent, nothing else that. I would highlight, Rob. I don't know if you want to add on. I pause on that one. I don't think there's much to highlight. I would say that it's consistently variable. I would say the same discussions taking place with customers when you talk about our Northstar model into them where we speak to customers about the broader automation platform per he is progressing very nicely in both the U.S. and the Americas and in EMEA. We are pretty pleased with the progress there and we will continue to work on the progress. In APJ, but. Market conditions. I would say all variable consistently. Understood. And then maybe just sneak one last one if I may, for Daniel, you've been pretty clear about on this call about the potential for generative AI to help making RPA more useful testing, seems like a very interesting use-case, as well as customer service. What does that mean from a pricing perspective? So as you guys incorporate this technology, do you feel like you'd be able to press on the pricing lever, given the potential productivity on the hands of debt you may extract deliver to customers. Yes, this is a big tailwind for us. And it's going to positively impacts all areas of our platform, because ultimately we will infuse generative AI across our platform. And. This basically will - with the increased adoption of our technology. I think the generative AI will pave the way for itself. And we will sell more robots, we will sell more documents processing. We will sell more AI units, so. I think. I think it's going reflect pretty nicely into our existing price model. I appreciate the thought Daniel. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please state your question Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on-the-go to-market refresh. Rob, you touched on it briefly, but can you take it a little bit more on the sales and go-to-market reorg across the three operating regions. Really just compare and contrast where you stand in North America versus EMEA versus APAC. Yes, look I mean. I think we've executed the go-to-market changes. As we said we would consistently. Those changes. So would say settled. Really well, mostly. In some of the segments. It's taken a little longer than then we would have hoped, but right now, I feel really good about where we all and the rhythm.
We have in the second-quarter and now the teams are focused. So, absolutely the right decision. Absolutely the right execution. And as you said a couple of times, Bryan. I think Neil, see the acceleration in the second half of the year due to the changes we've implemented. Okay, all right. And then just on the partnership ecosystem, kind of same question here, just any feedback from the service channel partners. As you are shifting some of the long-tail over to them and any learnings thus far on this plan. Yes. I would say the partners across the board. You got to look at the partners. If you look at the big GSI's. I think we are having way more discussions with them, paid very much involved in many of our NorthStar discussions around digital transformation, and big projects. So then that model fits really well.
Our existing partners, the local channel partners are seeing bigger opportunities as we continue to showcase the platform they get fundamentally understand how to position the platform and actually even in some of those partners see areas like Document Understanding where they actually really driving it. And then the distribution is where we still got some, I wouldn't say work to do, but we still got it. To see it come through. And look. The reaction. I mean that's the one probably that we don't mentioned because maybe. As far as global, but the partnership with T-System's with large companies in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and the public sector in Germany, is significant, right? We already working with Deutschlandticket, which is Deutsche Bahn, on the flat rate ticket system for the whole of Germany. So that's the big significant opportunity for UiPath as well. And then the SAP partnership. Coming out of Sapphire will be in-full execution mode and we really confident that. The senior leadership of SAP being here in Barcelona being on stage, tomorrow with their team and the customers, we'll showcase the fundamental difference of that partnership as well. Okay, good to hear. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. This is [Austin Williams] on for Michael Turrin. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like net-new ARR was down versus last year in the quarter. Is there any additional color you can add on whether it's new logos or expansions that are impacting that? And as a follow-up, are you seeing any change in the average deal sizes for new lands? Yes, so just when you look at it. I wouldn't say there's a driver between new logos and expansion. Really first thing is normalizing for FX, FX had a $5 million to $6 million impact in the quarter. So, I think that's the first piece. And the second is, it's more of a just a general the broader macroeconomic variability that we see and the transition that we have in terms of the go-to-market changes that we've made and that's appropriate, we commented on that at the start of the quarter.
So those are really the drivers versus pointing out a specific motion in terms of where it is. In terms of land sizes, we're really pleased with what segmentation has done in terms of focusing on the higher propensity customers we see. We're pleased with our large deal execution. Rob mentioned this our $1 million plus customers continue to grow. And from that standpoint. I think that's a good feeling from us in terms of both positioning the platform as well as larger deal execution, which of course involves average selling price being higher. Got it, thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. Please state your question. Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a question around the transition to solution-selling and the vertical approach here. I think last quarter you called out some relative strength in the financials vertical. Just curious if you get an update on where you might be seeing some traction across the verticals with that approach. Thank you. Yes, Brad. I mean, we still continue to see the benefits with the financial sector banking, health-care providers, we still see continue to see that we announced a couple of names. So that continues to be a source of strength, especially with the solution products like communication, mining and Document Understanding. But. I would say it's variable in other industries. In generic manufacturing, you see Test Suite being driven.
So from an industry point of view. I think over time as we produce more-and-more solution accelerators as we get more-and-more focus on which solutions at which industries you're going to see the expansion by industry. The PCA is significant as well as the global system integrators, the big potent actually to work with in specific industry focus areas and you're going to start to see that expand in the coming months as well, so. I wouldn't say specifically, we saw significant uptake in any particular industry. In the first quarter, but still, financial services, healthcare, are still the areas where we see -- that we have seen progress. Wonderful. Thank you so much. And one more if I may, just on a couple of partnerships here the Amazon SageMaker and Snowflake partnership, how do you envision these partnerships, impacting the business, are we talking about just more relevance by blending data from these datasets and AI, ML libraries. To increase the velocity of deployment of more. The accuracy of box. I mean, how do you see this impacting the business, as you bring in dataset from Snowflake and the AI ML library from AWS SageMaker? Thank you. Daniel, you can take the make a one-off those like. I think it's. But declared Brad that just help customers, automate faster connect. Cricket Snowflake Data in the manufacturing sector and deploy bots, much, much faster. Actually, we see quite a significant amount at the Sapphire event, we see a significant amount of customers in that space. Manufacturing. Wanted to understand more about the Snowflake partnership, and how they can actually deploy Boston manufacturing supply-chain logistics much faster. So we see that as a significant opportunity as well. Yes, obviously. I think the opportunity in in our analytics platform we use Snowflake has actually foundation there in-process mining and all our analytics, we've kind of standardized on the platform and we use the. The power of it and of course SageMaker is great for hosting models it's to accelerate our AI strategy. So all-in one, it's a really positive event for us. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Kingsley Crane with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question. Hi guys, this is [Gabriel Roth] for Kingsley. We can. Congratulations on the quarter. I find it very questioning about the generative AI being a great gateway to leverage the rest of the automation platform. So in that respect. What impact do you guys? Taking into account, put the guidance for this year are for the longer-term of generative AI and the adoption of the platform. The overall increase in thanks to it. Well. I think generative AI, it's a bit of a longer shot to have impacted the guiding for this year. We my estimation is. The real adoption in the enterprise would probably be. Start more like next year, rather than this current fiscal year. Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham. Please state your question. Hi, everyone, and congrats on a good quarter. Most of my questions have been asked but just wanted to ask for one and I apologize for the background noise on the plane here. But my question is on absent on your native cloud back I think they've been in the market for a little bit more than a year now. I just wanted to see if you had an update maybe on the traction to sell them versus the more traditional term license spot, you have out there. Thank you. We feel really good overall progress in our hybrid offering. I think is really good. I think ACR it's still early, like. There is a lot of our customers will still work and are developing their cloud strategies. Their full cloud strategies across enterprise automation. But the feedback from our customers, the interest continues to be very well and it's positioned well in the market, but our having that on the roadmap, coupled with the capabilities that continue to be released on our cloud platform. We feel very good about that. Thank you. And we have reached the end-of-the question-and-answer session, I'll now hand the floor back to Robert Enslin for closing remarks. Yes. Thank you everybody for joining us. We look forward to connecting with many of you in the coming weeks and we appreciate you all joining us today. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.","this afternoon's call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency, and our financial guidance for the fiscal second quarter and full year 2024 . a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation .",0.0

I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides which includes an embedded AI demonstration video. We will post the slides, and a copy of our prepared comments to our investor relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Second quarter was incredibly busy. Highlights include the delivery of exciting new AI platform capabilities and several high-energy in-person customer events around the world, all of them to standing room only. Not surprisingly, AI is at the top of everyone’s agenda. Digital transformation, where automation plays a strategic role, has never been more important or, with the latest evolutions in AI, more powerful.
Customers are excited about the value we deliver and recognize that our platform, which has been infused with AI since inception, provides an integrated set of capabilities that combines the best of our Specialized AI and governance with the creative power of GenAI, making the potential of automation almost limitless. And we aren’t just talking about AI, we deliver on the promise of AI and automation today across our platform. In particular, communications mining and document understanding are generating a lot of excitement which Graham Sheldon, our Chief Product Officer, will demo in a few minutes.
Turning to the numbers, we ended the quarter with ARR of $1.308 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year, driven by second quarter net new ARR of $59 million. We have approximately 10,890 customers, including new logos like Australian Postal Corporation, Leroy Seafood, Holmes Murphy & Associates, Daewoong Pharmaceutical, and Arrow Food Distribution. Customers with $1 million or more in ARR increased more than 30% year-over-year to 254, while customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 1,930. Second quarter revenue was $287 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating margin increased from negative 5% in the second quarter of last year to positive 10% in the second quarter of this year. As we progress towards our 20% plus long-term operating margin target and, we delivered $47 million in non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, a continuing reflection of our growing scale and focus on efficiency.
Given that the macro environment continues to be variable, I am pleased with our execution and results. The cohort of customers of $100,000 or more in net new ARR is performing well. Value selling is driving platform adoption and these deals are typically expansions where we have a good line of sight into deal progression. The lower end of the market has been harder to call, particularly new customer acquisition. I want to be clear, we feel good about the business and the role automation plays in digital transformation. We continue to execute against our strategic initiatives and there is a nice pipeline building as we move into the second half of the year.
Two quarters ago we formally launched our new go-to-market strategy to improve productivity, sell the platform, and intensify focus on customers that represent the longest and largest long-term opportunities for us. The team transitioned well to our new segmentation model and is embracing the broader platform opportunity.
In go-to-market, we continue to invest in industry verticalization, both in people and enablement tools, which is yielding nice results. We saw particular strength in banking and financial services, manufacturing, and technology in the second quarter, including great new logos like Performant Healthcare Solutions, First City Monument Bank, and Saint Peter’s Healthcare System. Expansion deals in the quarter included Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, a customer since 2017, who expanded to the full platform as they look to grow their automation program across the company.
In addition, our industry expertise gives us unique insights that we can leverage across our customer base, including tools like our solution accelerators. We now have more than 60 available to customers. A Texas based digital health system recently automated their claims form intake process. Using our accelerators, they expedited their design-to-deploy time from more than eight weeks down to just two.
The foundation of every sales engagement is defining the value of our end-to-end platform which helps customers accelerate their automation programs, drive operational efficiencies, and consolidate spend. During the quarter, Saudi National Bank expanded to the full platform as they plan to take their already mature automation program to the next level. Driving rapid digital transformation and using the full range of capabilities in our platform is a Board level priority that is actively sponsored by their Chief Technology Officer and the Chief Operating Officer.
Platform adoption is also driving competitive displacements. A great example is a fortune 500 oil producer and a UiPath customer since 2018 with over $10 million in cost savings to date. In a competitive take-out, that expanded to incorporate document understanding and process mining into their automation program as they look to consolidate one AI enabled platform. Looking forward, they plan to leverage our NorthStar value model to identify expansion opportunities across additional lines of business.
Not only is NorthStar helping to build pipeline, it also drove several strategic deals in the quarter. Using NorthStar the team delivered a comprehensive view of the operational excellence and tangible value automation could deliver to a financial services company. And as a result, the customer expanded to the full platform, including process mining, document understanding, communications mining, and test suite.
As part of our new segmentation, we have tasked our Emerging Enterprise team with driving both customer acquisition and early-stage expansion. And as an example, Apprio, a provider of specialized IT solutions, started their automation journey several years ago and recently engaged with UiPath to clearly define how automation can accelerate their growth trajectory. This resulted in a multi-year, seven-figure full platform deal to help them achieve rapid market expansion in healthcare operations.
Industry analysts are also recognizing our platform capabilities. UiPath was recently designated as a Leader in the Everest Group Intelligent Document Processing Products PEAK Matrix Assessment 2023. This is the first time UiPath has been named as a Leader in Intelligent Document Processing, and the only Leader recognized as a Star Performer for the biggest year-over-year advances. We were also named a Leader in the Everest Group Process Mining Products PEAK Matrix Assessment 2023 and the Everest Group Task Mining Products PEAK Matrix Assessment 2023.
Our partner ecosystem is key to elevating our market leadership position, growing our share of wallet across key accounts, and delivering best outcomes for our customers. One of many partner-led customer success stories is with Ashling Partners, who has helped ADT build a transformational automation program across its operations and customer service. This quarter that program expanded to ADT’s call center to provide customer service agents with a single pane of glass to reduce data entry, troubleshooting, and other time-intensive tasks.
We are also making great progress with SAP, engaging with customers and building a joint pipeline. During the quarter, a German agricultural company challenged by their S/4 migration, selected UiPath in a competitive win based on our holistic integrated platform. They are in the process of implementing test suite for regression testing on their S/4 migration and testing of all SAP modules. They also plan to automate processes in their finance department and incorporate process mining and AI into their automation program.
Before I move on, I want to highlight that our board of directors has authorized a $500 million stock repurchase program which underscores the confidence we have in our business, our ongoing cash flow generation, and the strength of our balance sheet.
In summary, we delivered another solid quarter of execution against a variable economic backdrop. We're starting to see the benefits from the go-to-market changes we implemented two quarters ago, and we’ll continue to exercise expense discipline, while investing to extend our market leadership.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Daniel. Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon everyone, before I begin, I want to thank our team members for their relentless commitment to building UiPath, serving our customers, and delivering our market leading AI-powered Automation Platform. I believe we are now at an inflection point with AI and I’m excited to have more time to focus on this next important evolution for the company. This is a time of unprecedented technology advances.
Having said that, AI has been an integral part of our platform since inception, starting with our original core capability, Computer Vision, which allows software robots to see and understand screens. Today our entire platform is infused with AI and we are at the cutting edge of the quickly evolving intersection of AI and automation.
To be effective, Generative AI needs context, which our software robots can deliver by gathering information from across the enterprise - in data, documents, CRM, ERP, and beyond. It also needs our platform to take action and operationalize the promise of AI today with an integrated set of capabilities that combines our Specialized AI with Generative AI. And, finally, it needs the governance our platform provides to help customers overcome a significant barrier to adoption.
Looking ahead, we expect this next evolution of GenAI to be a tailwind to the business, helping customers create better, more resilient automations more quickly and opening up novel use cases that facilitate the automation of even more processes.
First, we are enhancing developer productivity by reducing barriers to development with co-pilot-like experiences and project Wingman which we showed you during last quarter’s earnings call. At the Ai4 Conference in mid-August, we officially launched Wingman into private preview and we are already seeing strong demand from customers. Wingman brings together our AI Computer Vision’s deep understanding of computer screens with GenAI and is designed to enhance automation creation for both business users and developers through a user-friendly experience.
Second, we are leveraging GenAI to make our products better. For example, in document understanding and communications mining, we leverage Specialized UiPath models to classify and extract information, augmented by Generative models to achieve faster time-to-value and higher accuracy for unstructured data processing.
And third, this next wave of innovation will allow our customers to identify and enable more advanced automations capable of handling even the most complex processes.
To give you a better sense of how this all comes together, I’m going to share a demo narrated by Graham. While this scenario has been simplified for the earnings format, this is a use case that should resonate with many of you. If you are not on the webcast, please go to our investor relations website homepage for the demo link.
[Video Presentation]
[Technical Difficulty] responsible platform. And third, allow customers to drive action through our built-in models, their own custom models, and deployment of best-in-class external models. The result is a speedy resolution and smoother experience for Connor, efficiency and savings for Goldner Bank, and more time for Lisa to spend with customers.
Our constant innovation drives our growth and is essential to providing our customers with market-leading capabilities. Looking across the platform, we have established a competitive moat which is bolstered by our more than 850 patents globally, either granted or in the application process. Inside that number, there are more than 300 specific to AI, which we expect will grow as we continue to invest.
Finally, we invite you to join our user conference, Forward VI, next month in Las Vegas where you are invited to kick-off cocktails on Monday the 9th followed by our main event on the 10th and 11th. We will be showcasing our latest platform release 23.10, which introduces new Generative AI developer and end user experiences across our platform to help customers build real-world automations faster than ever before. Please reach out to the investor relations team for details.
With that, I will turn it over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel. And good afternoon everyone. Unless otherwise indicated I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis and all growth rates are year over year.
Turning to the second quarter, ARR totaled $1.308 billion, an increase of 25%, driven by net new ARR of $59 million. Excluding the FX headwind, net new ARR totaled $61 million. Included in this total is more than $500 million in Cloud ARR, both hybrid and SaaS, an increase of more than 125%, as customers continue to adopt our cloud offerings. For example, Scotiabank, who chose UiPath to further scale their global automation program as they move to the Cloud and plan to utilize our AI capabilities, document understanding, and unattended automation.
Our dollar-based net retention rate for the quarter was 121%. Normalizing for FX, our dollar-based net retention rate was 125%. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best-in-class. Revenue grew to $287 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX impact, which was an approximately $3 million tailwind, revenue grew 17%.
Remaining performance obligations increased to $905 million, up 28% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX impact, which was an approximately $4 million tailwind, RPO grew 27%. Current RPO increased to $560 million. Turning to expenses. We delivered a second quarter total gross margin of 86%. Software gross margin was 91%.
Second quarter operating expenses were $217 million. The restructurings we announced in fiscal 2023, combined with our go-to-market segmentation, have created an organization that's increasingly efficient and scalable and one which gives us ample room to continue to expand margins without sacrificing investments to grow the business.
GAAP operating loss of $78 million included $102 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating income was $30 million, resulting in a second quarter operating margin of 10%. Second quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $47 million.
We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no debt. And, as Rob mentioned, we are pleased to announce a $500 million stock repurchase program this afternoon.
Now, let me turn to guidance which assumes the overall macroeconomic environment continues to be globally variable. For the fiscal third quarter 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.359 billion to $1.364 billion. Revenue in the range of $313 million to $318 million. Non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $32 million. And, we expect third quarter basic share count to be approximately 567 million shares.
For the fiscal full year 2024, we expect ARR in the range of $1.432 billion to $1.437 billion. Revenue in the range of $1.273 billion to $1.278 billion. Non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $188 million. This translates to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 14.7%, an 850 basis point increase year-over-year. And, finally, we expect fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of more than $250 million or 20% adjusted free cash flow margin.
As we head into the second half of the fiscal year, the team remains focused on innovation, and driving the best possible outcomes for our customers and partners. Customer success is at the core of everything we do and also the foundation for profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.
Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the Operator. Operator, please poll for questions. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we'll now conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me. One question on the -- in this new world where AI is getting more and more important, what do you see in terms of your customer conversations with budget still kind of limited from the budgeting cycle last year? Like how does it play out for you? And how are you competing for budget dollars in this sort of environment where you know you need to spend more on AI, but the money needs to come from somewhere. And how does it fit to like overall spending? Thank you. Yeah, Raimo, I would say it's positive for us the discussion around AI. I think it helps infuse the platform. Our message around specialized AI and Generative AI together has really come through. Customers are generally confused by all the announcements that happened in the market, and they like our approach of showcasing how we've actually bolted into the product with Wingman and Jarvis and other solutions, which actually and document understanding, which we actually showed, which actually helps the platform be more valuable to them and helps us drive the platform to more important consequences. Yeah, I would like to add that more customers are realizing that automation is a great mean to get more value from Generative AI. Actually, even today, I was talking to one of the largest airline in the world, one of our biggest customers. And they highlight how they plan to combine GenAI with automation in their customer service. So I would say that it's a great tailwind for automation adoption across most of our customers. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And a quick follow-up for Ashim. Like a great increase on the free cash flow outlook. Were there any special factors in there that we should be aware of or just the better profitability is starting to play through? Thank you, and congrats again. Thanks, Raimo. No, just we feel really good about the changes that we made last year. We are continuing to see benefits of that come through. So that's organic. There's no special items to mention. And we feel like that is a sustainable path forward. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Thank you so much and I’ll have my congrats on top of Raimo’s. Ashim, are you able to provide the Q3 ARR growth guidance if we converted it into constant currency terms? And/or what is implied for the fiscal year now in constant currency terms. I'm not sure if any of that has moved around. Yeah, nothing has really moved around. We talked about it in the script of the headwinds, Raimo -- sorry, Mark. And so like I think that what we provided is there, normalized for foreign exchange, it's 26% growth in terms of the year-over-year comparison. And I'd say very similar outlook here for third and fourth quarter in terms of FX. It's not much of an impact as we go forward. Okay. Got it. And then, Rob, I'm curious just how commonly you see UiPath being pulled into some of the boardroom discussions out there that are maybe being led by the Accentures and Deloittes and Capgemini's of the world when they're sitting down with a large company and trying to formulate a Generative AI roadmap for a customer, and they made sense that some RPA would be involved as part of that tapestry. Do you see much volume along those lines popping up into the deal pipeline because I think you had some pretty upbeat commentary on that, how that pipeline is developing? Yeah. Mark, what I'd say we're having much more significant conversations with the systems integrators and with customers together with the systems integrators where we actually are working on joint opportunities with them. I would not classify it only as RPA. It is about the platform, it's about document understanding, communication, mining test, mining the moat that makes a difference and infusing our GenAI capabilities, which are actually visual for customers to see and how that benefits them. So that's happening much more. I mean, I spoke a lot about our NorthStar in the script, and our NorthStar is having -- is placing us in the boardroom. I mean, the value proposition that we are able to showcase with our customers even at a conservative level, is very, very strong. And I mentioned a very large insurance company, where we went out to a pretty detailed process level on explaining how automation and the full platform can benefit them. That customer is going to replace the document -- the existing document understanding with their communication and test mining and process mining and go all in on the platform. So we're very positive about our approach the SIs and being in the boardroom with customers, and we feel like it's fulfilling the -- what we said two quarters ago that, that's what we needed to do. Excellent. Thank you so much, Rob. Thank you, Mark. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please state your question. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. First one, on just the go-to-market progress. So is there any additional metrics you can share that would really demonstrate that the change in the go-to-market in really selling down through the C-suite is gaining that traction? I think I heard 30% growth in that $1 million cohort year-over-year, which is certainly encouraging. But just anything else there you can give KPI-wise sales force productivity, anything like? I think when you look at it, that is the primary metric that we look at, Bryan, because the $1 million-plus customers really shows the value of the platform in terms of what's moving and that is up 34%. We feel customers greater than $1 million that we feel really content with. The intangible piece that you also can look at is just overall, like our RPO balance is growing very well, which shows continued commitment on deals from our top customers. And then Rob has commented, but we really like the activity and the way that the sales force and the intimacy of customer relationships is happening. We talked about it in the first quarter among some of the changes. And feel like those discussions and those deal discussions are progressing very well. And that's the intangible factor that we really monitor. Yeah. And I would just add, we feel, Bryan, that we're also benefiting globally now in Asia Pacific and in Europe from the activity we implemented as well. We can see it coming through. And then one last item on that is more and more differential partners are actually speaking to us, partners that typically would not -- not in the [SI] (ph) space, not in the existing space that are trying to understand how they can utilize the UiPath platform in their business. So we feel really strong about all the activity. Okay. Appreciate that. And then just as it relates to pricing dynamics, can you just talk about what you're seeing in market pricing over the last several quarters really as it relates to competitive deals as well as what you're seeing on average across renewals? Yeah. We see it relatively stable. There's nothing -- people see the value and the ROIs that we provide. You can see that in many of the case studies and the stories and even in some of the demos, Brian, and I think that ROI has given us a good moat around pricing. And so really price is not as much of a factor as deals for us, especially with competition. People will try to undercut it, but they can't deliver the ROI that our platform delivers. And that's really why we've been able to maintain a pretty steady pricing and discounting set of metrics here, regardless of the economic conditions and competitive environment. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Thank you guys for taking the question. A little bit on sort of the competitive environment around Generative AI. All of us are going around and listening to a lot of companies talk to us about trying to infuse Generative AIs to their portfolios and it seems like a big benefit they expect to accrue is automation and a lot more automation within their solutions. Does that muddy the waters for you guys at all? And is there anything you have to do in your messaging to sort of help customers understand what they're going to get from a UiPath versus application vendors saying, “Hey, Generative AI is going to help take care of all these road casts and do all these automations for you?” Like how do you make sure that you ensure that clarity in the marketplace? Well, first of all, I would like to make clear that we believe Generative AI doesn't change the competitive dynamic when it comes to automation platform. In the end, most of the use cases for Generative AI are in the creator space. So you use Generative AI to create artifacts that are deployed on the platform. I think that plays into our advantage. I think there is no secret for everyone that we have the best automation platform, most complete the enterprise-grade platform that offer governance and security to our customers. Generative AI helps us to even increase the adoption because it can appeal to a broader audience, less technical people can create better automation. But our platform runs both automation much more reliable, much more secure than any other platform. So clearly, to me, that's an advantage. And I want to also point out that there is no company that has an exclusivity to a particular GenAI technology. We are using, for instance, Open AI, Google Vertex, Amazon Lambda, everything that is in the market. So I think that long term -- mid- to long term, the creator GenAI will be basically commoditized. And the essence would be that the best platform is going to win even with better chances in the market because the adoption will be also democratized. I'll tell you, Keith, this is from my side. I think it's given us an incredible amount of tailwind to articulate, first, our AI story at UiPath and give us a platform to showcase where we are with AI and how far we've come. And I think that's really surprised a lot of customers in space. In the last -- since we announced the summit year, I think it was March, we announced the Summit AI in New York City, we had 16 events in Asia Pacific, and they were standing room only. And I can tell you from those discussions, and I've spoken to a number of C-level executives that actually attended in person. And the comment back was, we are so surprised at how far you are. We're super excited about the opportunity that automation can bring and how far you can take it. So from a go-to-market perspective, from our team's perspective, I think it's been an incredible opportunity to showcase UiPath, the platform and the decisions we made in September of last year to bring it out. And I think people will be very excited at Forward VI to see how far we've come as well. Excellent. Thank you, guys. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Congrats as well. Maybe just continuing the GenAI kind of questioning. Yeah, a lot of good content today. And I'm curious, Rob, how do you expect to articulate success monetarily? Do you think in a couple of quarters or a year, you're going to be able to specifically call out the actual tailwind or benefit to growth from GenAI? I think we will be able to say -- look, I think our strategy that we'll continue to execute again. We'll continue to drive that. We'll continue to look at how we benefit from GenAI. And I believe we are already showcasing how it's impacting our results as part of our strategy. And I think that will continue as we continue to drive NorthStar and the value creation that customers are receiving as we get more and more reference customers you think we'll scale as we speak more in the boardroom and we bring the ASIs to the floor, all of those will be in our favor. And honestly, when you look at communication, mining, document understanding of what we're doing in that space, these are game changers for customers and the value they receive. And that's what's going to showcase and that's what we'll showcase in terms of the return that we will get in the next quarters and the next years. Got it. Thank you. Maybe just a quick one for Ashim. Realizing that NRR is more of a trailing metric. It did tick down a little bit here sequentially. Do you think we're closer to a bottom in that number as we sort of think towards the second half of this year? Yeah. I mean the way that I look at this is I feel really good about the progress that we've made on the go-to-market changes that we've articulated earlier this year and last year. And I think as those continue to pay dividends, our expansion rate is the area that you're going to see benefit, you'll see benefit come through in that area. So we still are navigating a variable environment, but the changes that we made, we just -- we're two quarters from having done it, one quarter from stabilization. So I really look forward to seeing the benefits of that come through our metrics here as we continue to execute. Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Matt. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please state your question. Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the verticals. It sounds like you're seeing some strength here in banking, manufacturing, tech. Any color as to where you're seeing that strength? Are there certain solutions that customers are expanding with more use cases? Is it new business that you're seeing strong in those verticals? And then any commentary on perhaps a vertical with this new pivot towards solution selling that we might start to see on that list in the coming quarters? Yes, Brad. Great question. We definitely see the full platform around process mining, document understanding and communication driving a lot of that as an integrated platform as customers want to expand automation from pure RPA into broader categories where we're able to use NorthStar. You see that in financial services, banking, in particular, both in Europe and in North America, insurance for sure, across payers and providers. in that space. Remember, we've also implemented go-to-market, which has got industry skills, part of it and our industry solutions team is pretty strong. So we're seeing it in those industries. I would also -- and we forgot to mention public sector, some really strength in public sector that's driving that as well in the federal government. So we're seeing in multiple areas. And I mentioned oil and gas as well, including other areas of energy opportunities as well. Wonderful. Thanks. And one more, if I may, just on [plan versus expand] (ph). I guess where are you in that balance? Could we start to see more Atlanta? You mentioned some top of funnel softness here but just maybe in the big enterprise or even medium enterprise, could we see some progress with more land accounts going forward? Yeah, we're working -- I mean, we see -- obviously, we see -- we like we are on the $1 million ARR and above in the $100,000 ARR and above, and we continue to work on the distribution model in this space, and we'll continue to treat some of those models that we've had previously in that space. Ashim? Yeah. I feel like the quality of what we have is much better. When we're looking at the customers and the logos that we're acquiring, so our enterprise presence or enterprise connections, I think we've seen meaningful progress there. We talk about kind of smaller mid-market, emerging enterprise, we say that in various episodes. I think that that particular segment is going to be more impacted by the variability of the macroeconomic conditions. So I think, Brad, the area for us is not a quantity play necessarily that's going to churn up and down. It's quality and then where we want to get even better and better is then advancing those quality customers up through better and better sales specialists to increase our expansion. That's kind of how we are measuring it and how we look to it. Great to hear. Thank you so much. Our next question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please state your question. Hi, everyone. This is Joe Meares on for Terry. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the SAP relationship briefly in your prepared remarks. I'm just curious how they're helping you on the go-to-market side? And is there any way that you can quantify early benefits from the partnership? Yeah. multiple aspects. One is working with ASIs. They -- we also have joint teams working on joint accounts. We've created a common architecture to present to our customers. We're busy going through the enablement of both organizations. And that will continue to expand through the year. So we've had multiple significant discussions between both companies, and we feel really positive around the enablement. And right now, it's all about enablement and positioning with customers and working with the ASIs to incorporate the automation in how they go to market as well. And we will see the benefits of that SAP partnership in '25 for sure -- in FY '25. Great. And then just as a follow-up, is there any way that you can quantify the impact of the 10 solution accelerators you have out there that they're having on the implementation cycles or ROI for customers? Thanks again. We don't disclose metrics around individual solutions or product lines at this time. What I can tell you is we continue to monitor the applicability in the sales cycle and customer uptake, and we're really pleased with the feedback, but we don't provide quantitative metrics or disclose them. Thank you. Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please state your question. Hey, thank you. I have a single set of questions, but two parts here. One for Ashim, one for Daniel. I'm thinking, Dan, since we last spoke, I've had a lot of fun working with training up various different AI models of a convolutional one working on a workstation right now. And I think what struck me through some of this experience is how many of these models are getting more and more efficient, especially being deployed in the Generative AI space sufficiently being deployed on smaller and smaller sets of hardware. So I'm curious kind of two parts here. Firstly, perhaps for Daniel, is there an opportunity in the future perhaps for more of the Generative AI workloads? We shifted towards the Edge rather than using, say, like centralized APIs from some of the hyperscalers out there? And then secondly, for Ashim, while we're in this phase right now of having Generative AI primarily hosted and available through hyperscalers, is there any impact on the gross margin line at all to some of the products that are being offered as they're run through these APIs? Thank you. I think that's a very interesting question and perspective about what the future of GenAI. We are experiencing quite a bit with Llama II at this point. And eventually, I think for some of the use cases, like the one in [Migma] (ph), we would love to be capable of deploying this on the edge because we'll significantly reduce the cost, the bandwidth required, time to value, and it's kind of premature at this point to really understand if we can run a significantly large model like, I don't know, 13 billion parameters on the Edge. But certainly, it's an interesting way to look forward. And then Fred, like, when I look at it, our gross margin is 88%. We talked about 85% and long-term model of greater than 80%. These are numbers that we've done there. I think right now with what we see in front of us, we factored the uptick of both the cloud and AI capabilities in there, and we're in the early days of pricing on these areas, and those are going to be factors for us to consider in terms of workloads and where they are. So we look at this as developing tremendous value. And so it's not really a threat to our margins from that perspective right now, and we feel very good about the way we've modeled that going forward. Thank you. And then if I could ask one more, I guess, a third question here because Rob, I don't want to fret about you at all. I don't want to leave you unquestioned. I'd love to ask as you're having conversations with executives that are considering adoption of broader suites of AI solutions, just how are you with UiPath considering and addressing privacy concerns, data governance concerns the like, especially with respect to Generative AI? Probably a question for Daniel. But I would tell you that generally, our security folks will take, our CISA will take -- and CISA security team will take them through how we deal with data security, data privacy, had lands in multi-tenants where the testing takes place and explain to them how we go through it in in a way that we would normally go through any kind of sales. But so far, we're handling it, I would say, not with the ease, but in very detailed discussions, and we have detailed road maps around that as well. And actually, automation offer a very good way to anonymize request to even a public gene service. For instance, if you want to -- if you want to understand better document, we can use our on-prem services to OCR to digitize the document and then apply [PI] (ph) algorithm and then send an anonymized document to GenAI and answer questions about it and then translate it back to the user. I think there are different approaches to privacy and security. And we are really well positioned to leverage our platform to offer this enterprise-grade use of GenAI. Thank you all very much. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please state your question. Hi. This is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Congratulations on the strong quarter, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for me. As you look into the deal trends through August and September, are you seeing more of a continuation of the same deal scrutiny that's been prevalent through the year or conversations starting to get more constructive and do customers seem more willing to invest. Are there any changes in general that you'd flag? Thank you. No. Like from our standpoint, one, we don't really -- I don't want to give in-quarter updates, Kirk, which I know everybody can respect. I think we've we feel -- just the environment, I think Rob commented on it. I think we look at the environment relatively stable, is variable. And depending on the industry, I think conversations move up or down. That being said, Rob talked about it earlier. I think customer conversations are very constructive. They have been. And just having been a customer, I can tell you where there's an ROI, it's -- the conversations are constructive. And I think that's something that we've demonstrated across our customer base for a while now. Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please state your question. Hey, Ari, you are on mute. Please unmute yourself. We can't hear you. Why don't we go to the next one, please? Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Hi, guys. This is Billy on for Michael. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk a bit about the trends you're seeing in selling to IT and IT users versus maybe the line of business and business users, especially within the context of the opportunity for Generative AI to democratize that adoption of automation? Yeah. What I would tell you is when we launched the platform, we always said we needed to get into C level, and we needed to be more relevant with the IT, the CIO. And that would also bring in ASIs. And we feel like that we're now able to actually bring the two together, showcase why they need the platform, how the platform helps them consolidate software, allows them to focus on areas in discovery and automation, infused with AI. And then we're able to take that using NorthStar into the boardroom and articulate the value that the CFO or the CEO or the head of HR can actually get from automation.
So that's more and more the conversations we're having, all the NorthStar discussions we talk about is exactly that. I feel like the CIOs are really starting to understand the platform, the benefits they get and the value that they can get from it. And that's why they actually want to use more of the platform when they understand how you can connect document understanding, to communication mining, using test suite to drive that and bolt into automation. We see that as something that's differentiating us versus the competition in a significant way, and the value equation is just -- that's really driving the issue into the boardroom as well. Super positive about it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please state your question. Hi, everyone. Congrats on the nice quarter. I guess one question I have is, one of the items that came up in our work in the quarter was all the kind of explosion and interest in GenAI was kind of an accelerator. It certainly enhanced customer interest in some of the automation solutions that are out there, specifically RPA. But at the same time, it almost made some deals a little bit maybe more complex and helped shift some deals around. Wanted to see how you thought about the balance of kind of that interest in making deals more complex versus maybe in generating larger deals versus maybe slowing some deals down in the quarter and thoughts on second half opportunities within that. Thank you. Yeah. I mean what I would tell you is that our customers that we've been working with, the deals we spoke about around NorthStar, our customers have been focused on value and the value creation that we can create from them. Once they've gone through that and they see what's the opportunity, they want to understand the technical environment, what the product does, how it goes. And that's kind of secondary to many of them. There's a view that we are one of the best engineering organizations in automation that we actually know where we're going with GenAI, we know AI at an incredibly detailed level, and that's why we feel like the whole movement that's happened has given us an ability in a stage to actually showcase our differentiation in this market. In other words, customers also are stunned. They don't want to see announcements. They want to actually see real benefits that they can showcase and how it can showcase through automation. So we feel really good about that. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please state your question. Hey, Michael. Hey, great. Thanks. Appreciate taking the question. The net retention rate metric looks to be stabilized in the 120s. You have a good cadence of AI-related product announcements that we're all adjusting. The Q4 guide for ARR looks more muted than what we generally expect from a seasonally stronger period from the business. And so maybe, Ashim, you can just help frame how you're incorporating some of the go-to-market changes, just some of the macro commentary and any visibility you have into just deal progression between now and end of the year and how it all stacks up into the rest of your guidance if that -- if there's any way to compare that at all to prior [indiscernible]. I would actually just say the word, thanks, I would just say the word is consistency. We've been pretty consistent about guiding what's in front of us, but also thinking about the factoring in the variability of the environment and the go-to-market transition. We're pleased with the progress of it. We feel good about our guidance. Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to management for closing remarks. Yeah. I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us for the questions. And I would look forward to seeing you all at Forward VI. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Have a good evening. Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Kelsey Turcotte, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for UiPath. Thank you. You may begin. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review UiPath's third quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, which we announced in our earnings press release issued after the close of the market today.
On the call with me are Daniel Dines, UiPath's Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Rob Enslin, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ashim Gupta, Chief Financial Officer. Rob will start the discussion and then turn the call over to Daniel. After that, Ashim will review our results and provide guidance, and then we'll open the call for questions.
Our earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. We will be discussing non-GAAP metrics on today's call.
This afternoon's call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and grow our platform as well as our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2023, and our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2023, to be filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
I would also like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared comments to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call. In addition, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter results underscore the compelling value our end-to-end automation platform delivers for our customers and the strength of our business model.
For the quarter, ARR grew 24% to $1.378 billion driven by our third quarter net new ARR of $70 million, while revenue was $326 million, up 24%. We continue to deliver growth while driving operational efficiencies across the organization. Non-GAAP operating margin increased more than 600 basis points year-over-year to 13%. We also delivered non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $44 million.
As many of you know, at the beginning of this fiscal year, we pivoted our go-to-market resources towards organizations that have a meaningful runway to invest in enterprise automation over the long term. This investment has significantly increased our presence in the C-suite and helped raise our profile with partners of all sizes.
You could feel our momentum at FORWARD VI, our annual user conference, where we hosted more than 3,000 guests, including automation practitioners, industry visionaries, key customer decision-makers. We also launched our inaugural UiPath AI10 Awards program, recognizing UiPath customers who embody what it means to be a leader in AI at work. I left the event super energized about the tangible value our platform is delivering for our customers and our leadership position in the market.
FX-adjusted dollar-based net retention for the quarter was 123%, and we closed a record number of third quarter deals over $1 million in ARR. Customers with $1 million or more in ARR grew 31% to 264, while customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 1,974.
Industry verticalization continues to be a strategic priority for the company with playbooks, marketing events and enablement to support our teams. We now have 70 solution accelerators available in our marketplace, with IT service management software, user provisioning, a two-way match invoice processing for Coupa and SAP among some of the most popular downloads.
While we saw broad-based strength in net new ARR across industries this quarter, there were a couple of standouts. The federal team delivered a record quarter as agencies are increasingly standardizing on our AI-powered business automation platform with a robust set of end-to-end capabilities to enrich employee experience, create mission readiness and achieve breakthrough outcomes. Customer highlights included Veteran Affairs, Coast Guard, the IRS, the Department of Homeland Security.
We're also working with the United States Department of Agriculture to support their future of work initiative, delivering a new era of citizen and employee experiences. Using our full platform, USDA is driving mission-impactful enterprise automations across their HR, finance and IT departments. The program also features a digital assistant on every USDA employee desktop, driving personal productivity for approximately 100,000 employees.
Momentum continues in financial services and health care where automation delivered considerable value. This includes 1 of our top 25 customers, a large nonprofit health system in the United States. Taking a deeper look at their automation journey, they are a great example of how customers expand with us over time.
Working closely with our account executives and global systems integrators, their journey started in 2018 with core RPA. And over the last several years, they've expanded to Attended Automation, Document Understanding, Test Suite and Process Mining.
To date, they have achieved a return on investment of over $250 million. And this quarter, in one of our largest deals in company history, they expanded to the full platform as they work to create a centralized enterprise automation service department with a mandate from their EVP sponsor to deliver automation across the entire enterprise. They're also in the process of developing use cases for Communications Mining and UiPath Apps.
Customers standardize on our AI-powered automation platform to deliver transformational outcomes that streamline processes, eliminate errors, operate with the enterprise-quality execution needed to succeed in today's environment.
A great example is Johnson Controls. After starting the automation journey in 2021 with core RPA, they adopted the full UiPath platform as they work to consolidate the automation program to one end-to-end solution. They also plan to leverage our AI capabilities, like Document Understanding, Test Suite and Task Mining, to drive automation across their entire business.
And another example is the Department of Work and Pensions, the United Kingdom's largest public service department. They have been using core RPA since 2018 to help their most vulnerable citizens improve their quality of life by automating millions of service and support claims each year. Since their first deployment, they have scaled to over 1,000 robots in production and saved 3.1 million hours to date. During the quarter, they expanded to the full platform as they look to harness AI and integrate Document Understanding, Process Mining and Communications Mining into their automation program to improve citizen services, drive operational efficiencies and increase cost saving and capacity creation.
We're also landing new logos, which adopt multiple platform products in their first purchase, like Tenable and KIK Customer Products (sic) [ KIK Consumer Products ]. In their first phase of deployment, KIK intends to leverage unattended robots and document understanding to drive efficiency across their finance department with the long-term goal of scaling automation across their entire enterprise.
Our value-based go-to-market tool, NorthStar, also continues to drive deeper customer conversations as we strategically position the differentiated and actionable benefits of AI-powered automation. A great example is Sobeys, a customer since 2020, where we created a NorthStar road map to help them maximize the return on investment of their automation program. And as a result, Sobeys expanded the automation footprint in the quarter to streamline processes in finance, merchandising and supply chain and to improve the hiring process in stores. They're also investigating how they may be able to use our platform in their SAP transformation journey.
Turning to SAP partnership. While in the early stages, we are excited about the collaboration between our teams. I recently joined Scott Russell, SAP Executive Board Member Customer Success, to co-host their sales leadership meeting and continue to see success in signing new logos from this partnership.
Key one for me, the Arnott's Group in Australia, an Australian legend, the Australian producer of biscuits and snack food. The Arnott's Group selected the UiPath platform to optimize business processes and reduce operating costs. Their initial focus will be on automating end-to-end sales order and invoice processing.
We also announced an expanded partnership with Deloitte, one of SAP's largest and most strategic partners. Deloitte will embed the UiPath AI-powered business automation platform into their Ascend service delivery platform, powering the next generation of SAP transformation.
These strategic relationships are powerful for our customers, but they also drive increased engagement with GSIs and our partner ecosystem that has never been more invested in than they are right now. At FORWARD VI, we hosted an impactful session for more than 750 partners, outlining our streamlined strategy that is designed to accelerate growth and revenue for our partners while creating solutions that deliver exceptional value to our customers.
Our partners and GSIs are an important element of our go-to-market motion that help us expand our reach to customers in a scalable, efficient and cost-effective way. For example, working with Deloitte, an Australian government agency has built a robust automation program across their finance and HR business lines where they utilize Document Understanding to streamline invoice processing, reduce errors and enhance data accuracy. To further accelerate the automation program, they adopted Task Mining in the quarter to analyze processes and accelerate scoping activities.
Broadening our technology ecosystem also makes it easier for customers to deploy automation. We recently announced several new strategic partnerships. This includes Amazon Bedrock, which enables automation developers and citizen developers to seamlessly integrate generative AI directly into their UiPath Studio and Studio Web automations; and the availability of the AI-powered business automation platform on the Google Cloud Marketplace early 2024.
In summary, third quarter results are another proof point of our commitment to delivering strong top line growth and expanding profitability and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.
I want to thank our employees and partners for their support. None of this would be possible without your relentless focus on unlocking value for our customers day in and day out.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Daniel. Thanks, Rob. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us.
The automation market is at an inflection point as the market-leading tool that enables organization to drive actionable value from AI. We believe this is a huge opportunity for UiPath.
At FORWARD VI, we introduced our latest platform release, 2023.10, and deliver scores of new capabilities that seamlessly translate the potential of AI into tangible action to drive business outcomes for our customers.
From my perspective, one of the most exciting announcements at FORWARD was UiPath Autopilot, a new set of AI-powered capabilities for developers, testers, analysts and knowledge workers designed to enhance the user experience across the UiPath platform.
We expect Autopilot, which is based on generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, document understanding and specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade, end-to-end process automation.
Autopilot for Studio intended to help developers across skill levels, build automation faster by leveraging natural language descriptions to generate automation workflows. For less technical developers, this is a great starter tool, while an advanced developer will benefit from increased productivity.
Autopilot for Test will accelerate every phase of the testing life cycle from generation of test to surfacing insights from test results.
And finally, as the AI companion for business users, we anticipate that Autopilot for everyone will help users create and use personalized and intelligent micro automations on the fly.
We also shared exciting announcement around intelligent document processing at FORWARD, introducing our next-generation experience powered by active learning and generative AI. Our next-gen IDP permits almost anyone to train specialized AI models for specific domains and document types. And our internal benchmarking shows that our next-gen IDP experience accelerates model training time by up to 80% from a week to a day for complex scenarios, with down to minutes for simpler forms.
Document Understanding is driving significant value for customers, including a Chicago-based public utility working with Deloitte. They have created a robust automation program across their organization, leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their metal inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date. With C-level sponsorship during the quarter, they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey, with the goal of saving over $70 million a year.
And we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape, Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing, or IDP, 2023-2024 vendor assessment, where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining, integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform.
Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market-leading capabilities with a customer-first mindset. I spend a lot of time with our teams in both Belgium and Romania this quarter. And I am energized by our cutting-edge product road map focused on transforming enterprise automation by harnessing the next generation of AI technologies.
Together with our world-class team with engineers, I am excited to dedicate more time driving UiPath's innovation agenda as I transition into my new Chief Innovation Officer role this winter.
With that, I will turn it over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, we'll be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year.
Turning to the third quarter. ARR totaled $1.378 billion, an increase of 24%, driven net new ARR of $70 million. Excluding the FX tailwind, net new ARR totaled $69 million.
We ended the quarter with 10,865 customers, including new logos like New Relic, Smile Doctors, Beacon Health System and MidWest One Financial Group.
As we said last quarter, we continue to see macro headwinds at the lower end of our market and remain focused on acquiring customers with a higher propensity to grow.
Our dollar-based net retention rate for the third quarter was 121%. Normalizing for FX, dollar-based net retention rate was 123%. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best in class.
Revenue grew to $326 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $3 million tailwind, revenue grew 23%.
Remaining performance obligations increased to $995 million, up 31% year-over-year. Normalizing for FX, which was an approximately $16 million tailwind, RPO grew 29%. Current RPO increased to $599 million.
Turning to expenses. We delivered a third quarter overall gross margin of 87%, and software gross margin was 92%. As the team continues to drive cost discipline, we now expect fiscal year 2024 gross margins to be approximately 86%.
Third quarter operating expenses were $240 million, highlighting the leverage in our business and our commitment to expense management and operating discipline.
GAAP operating loss of $56 million included $96 million of stock-based compensation.
Non-GAAP operating income was $44 million, resulting in a third quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 13%.
Third quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $44 million. As of October 31, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt.
Under our $500 million buyback program, which we announced on September 6, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $16.26 through October 31. Since November 1, under a 10b5-1 plan, we've repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares at an average price of $17.38 through November 28, 2023.
Now let me turn to guidance, which assumes the global macroeconomic environment continues to be variable.
For the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $381 million to $386 million; ARR in the range of $1.450 billion to $1.455 billion; non-GAAP operating income to be approximately $78 million; and we expect fourth quarter basic share count to be approximately 567 million shares; and finally, we expect fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of more than $250 million.
Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Theo Thun on for Keith Weiss. Maybe to start off, a quick question on sort of AI and how you see it fit into the current budget environment. Clearly, budget growth is still somewhat suppressed. And you're one of the few companies that's sort of uniquely positioned between traditional automation and generative AI technologies. Where do you see customers kind of take the dollars from when they're spending on these AI technologies, whether that's within the product areas that you offer or, more broadly, anything that's kind of coming out of your customer conversations in terms of how spend is getting reallocated in light of AI? Yes. Good question. What I would say is that when customers are looking at spending with us and the AI story and AI to automation connection really fits well to what customers want to invest. And in many cases, the investments are coming out of the business case and business value that we produce in NorthStar and are able to show the efficiencies in how to gain so they can invest in innovation. And they see us as an innovation leader today with AI and innovation, combined with our AI-powered platform. So I don't feel like it's been taken away from one group to another. I feel it's really driven by the business case we were able to drive with C-level suites and how we focus on industry solutions and how we've connected those to the buying cycle with customers. Great. That's helpful. And then a quick question on the margin side. It looks like sales and marketing expenses stepped up pretty markedly on a sequential basis. Obviously, you also had your FORWARD conference in the quarter. But anything that you can highlight in terms of where you're investing, are you back to kind of growing your sales force more markedly? And does that kind of continue into next year? Anything that you can share there would be great. Yes. I would just highlight two points. First is we are going to continue to invest in our sales team and our sales capacity, especially as we head into next year. And then the second is, if you recall, we also are dealing with -- we also have the reallocation of our software expenses. So first through third quarter, you'll see sales and marketing versus G&A a little bit lopsided and which will be caught up in fourth quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. I'll add my congrats. So Rob, I'm thinking back to the Analyst Day just over a year ago, and you had mentioned there that every tech company, of course, has shelfware and that UiPath does as well. If you think about it about a year later, do you sense that customers have worked down any excess inventory they might have had in terms of bots, maybe hitting a level where they might need to replenish and just start moving forward a bit faster as we get into next year? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes, Mark, look, as I said earlier, companies deal with shelfware. We feel good that our platform actually helps us move customers from not only bots into the broader platform as they focus on efficiencies. This marketplace that we're dealing with today certainly benefits efficiencies and new business models. So we feel really good that we are able to take customers to the next level with our platform and our C-level activity. Okay. And Ashim, when we look at it arithmetically, the deceleration in ARR has been moderating, which, of course, is great to see. It looks like it could step down a bit closer to 20% next quarter. But is it possible to entertain the thought of kind of holding a level around 20% for a period of time? Or do you think we should kind of keep that trending down into the teens as we've had it, just trying to be mindful of the law of large numbers and some of the macro unknowns that are out there? Yes. I would just say, Mark, we're really pleased with our performance and the team's execution. We're focused on closing out a good year-end here, and the teams are really focused on that. And we look at our fourth quarter guidance, just putting the right prudence and the right macroeconomic variability included in our guidance. And we'll update as we get closer to next year. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. This is Chirag on for Kirk. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that large deals landed extremely strong. Do you have any additional commentary around what you're seeing with these large deals in terms of both new logos and renewals and how you expect this trend to continue looking ahead to next quarter and next year? Essentially, all in all, do you believe that we're close to a more stabilized macro and spending environment? Or are you still seeing some broader choppiness out there? Yes. I mean, look, we feel really good about how our teams are adopting all the changes that we've made and how they're connecting with customers and the relationships we're having with customers. The expansion is really, in many ways, driven through our growth products. With all the AI communication that's happening in the market, it allows us to have meaningful conversations with customers. They see why the platform is relevant. And then, as I said earlier on, we've been driving NorthStar quite a bit in showing where customers can really look at processes and tasks and understand how to drive value with the automation platform.
So folks talk about digital transformation and connect. We believe that AI-powered automation is really helping digital transformation with our customer base and our larger customers. And we're pretty happy with some of the net new companies that we've acquired over the last -- the quality of them, New Relic, you look at these, kind of these are good companies that will expand with us over time if we do the right stuff. And so we feel good about that. We feel good about how our industry focus is helping us change the game in this environment. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. I wanted to ask a question around some of the departmental expansions you've seen. You talked about industries here. I think banking and public sector sounded good. But are you finding that you're seeing now, with the uplift in expansion activity here with NRR, that you're getting outside of finance and accounting into IT, HR, some of these other use cases in the departments? Yes. So I would say we have broad -- we've seen broad industry activity with manufacturing, with retail, with fashion retail, with grocery, hard goods retail. As we said, we feel really positive about public sector and public sector globally. And we also see a significant amount of activity outside of the finance office in procurement and in the IT organization. So it's much more broad-based, and we feel really good about where we're focused on that. Great. And then one on the FORWARD conference, if I could, please. If you could just remind us how important that event is for lead management and moving deals through the pipeline. And how do you feel coming out of the conference this year versus years past in terms of momentum? Brad, I've only got 2 years' experience. And what I would tell you, I was super excited to see the quality of customers and the quality of the event and the quality of the discussions that we had. If you look at the companies we had onstage with us and what they were doing with us, these are really transformational. If you look at the partnerships with SAP and Deloitte onstage with us, this was transformational. We spoke about 750 partners that we're aligning around the channel strategy. So we feel good that we actually -- FORWARD is actually a catalyst event to move UiPath, help our branding, position us in the C-suite and make a difference. And it certainly does help our pipeline as well. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Congrats from me as well. First, like a more bigger-picture question, like if you think about the different areas of strength that you saw this quarter, like can you specifically speak a little bit about what you saw on test drop? Because that's what we're hearing from our checks as one of the areas where, especially in the SAP ecosystem, there seems to be a lot going on there. And I'm not quite sure you're getting enough credit. And then I had a follow-up for Ashim, please. Yes. So if I look at the broader picture, if you look at the market today, as I said earlier on, customers are looking for ways to drive efficiencies to fund other activity. And there's not a significant amount of new business models that are driving growth. So that really helps us significantly. And obviously, that fits well into where SAP are focused with their transformation objectives, their RISE program, which is an ongoing program. And I believe that we've actually moved the needle significantly with SAP, with the SAP activity between the different sales organizations. And we are involved in many transformation discussions with SAP and our GSI partners, and we will see more of that.
Test is a key part of that because it has an incredible value proposition, which allows customers to drive not necessarily savings but time benefits. And really, automation of testing is one of the biggest challenges customers have in a big SAP environment. And we feel we do an excellent job helping customers achieve significant test results, which obviously help mitigate any risk associated with a go-live. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Then one for Ashim. As you think about -- like it does look like the demand trends are stable. And we kind of could potentially look for better times ahead. Obviously, you have the best net ARR addition for a few quarters now as well. How do you -- and you guys -- but also you guys have been very disciplined around cost and margins. But at some point, you need to think about lead times for salespeople, et cetera. How do you think about that balance or like getting ready for eventually better times versus where you are at the moment? What are you seeing in terms of productivity gains for sales, et cetera, for example, to kind of drive this going forward? I mean I would start with we have a very powerful business model, Raimo, strong gross margins, that allows us to invest while still generate cash and margins. And so we have been investing, whether that is within our product team as well as our sales team. I mentioned earlier, we're investing in our frontline sales team and our sales capacity, and we'll continue to invest in areas where we see the right returns and the right investments. And Rob and the team looks at that on an ongoing basis and we do as a leadership team. At the same time, we also are looking for efficiencies. So together with that, I think we're constantly in investment mode. We feel very positive about our value offering. And we feel like we can both drive that investment while still generate cash and margins. Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist. Congrats from me on the quarterly results. First of all, I guess, Rob, maybe the first question, maybe I'm pretty simple here, but NorthStar road map seem like a no-brainer. Like how much of your customer base or at least your larger enterprises have you actually unleashed the NorthStar road maps on? And the second part of my first question is I'm hearing a lot from you about full platform adoption. Have you done anything with product or packaging to create less inertia to move all in with the platform? And then I had a follow-up for Ashim. Sure. Great questions. So I would say we are doing a lot around pricing and packaging and obviously, pricing packaging and solutions. And it's a constant upgrade, I would say of that, but you got to be very careful about how you actually bring that into the market. And we're focused on really simplifying SKUs and so making it very simple for customers to purchase and also making it simple for customers to mix and match solution sets with AI units or bots in a way that's very simple so that they can actually expand with less friction. And we're doing significantly more of that.
NorthStar is a combination of a great value-based tool that has to be connected to the C-suite. You have to have sellers that are able to communicate. And as we enable our organization more and we get more references, we're able to scale more and continue to scale the organization. So there's still plenty of opportunity for us to continue driving that and continue to work on NorthStar with the organization. That's great. And I guess, Ashim, in terms of all the work on the go-to-market side this year, is there potentially a further drift in NRR? Could it actually improve from here? I mean it's already best in class. But I'm just kind of curious how you could see NRR trends potentially with more of the harvesting of all this work on the go-to-market side. I'd just say we continue to be pleased with where we are and how we're executing, and we're going to look forward to closing out fourth quarter. And we'll provide more updates next year. Our next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. I'd also like to congratulate you on a very strong quarter. I wanted to focus once again on generative AI. But firstly, looking at your products and seeing it being integrated throughout your portfolio and your suite, I'm looking forward to really seeing what you can do there. But I wanted to take, I guess, a bigger-picture look at the longer-term of the market, considering the impressive results we've seen with autonomous agents using, for example, like GPT-4, blending vision and text, et cetera. I'm curious, considering the UiPath has really been one of the original autonomous agent companies with your attended and unattended RPA, how do you think about the market evolution over time with agent-based or agent-like functionality being built using generative AI now? Well, I think that direction in the market that we are seeing right now around autonomous agents prove a bit our approach that always said that AI plus automation is the thing that drives the biggest outcomes for our customers. Actually, this is what we are seeing. A lot of our customers, after the initial little bit of a pause around how AI is going to help me with my automation, they realize that they need powerful automation platform in order to harness the power of AI.
And going forward and on a longer-term basis, where UiPath are in one of the best positions to build the next-generation foundational model that understand the processes, tasks, screens and documents, type of multimodal, that is built in, in order to drive automation. So to me, it's clear that the world is going into that direction. And again, we are really in a very good position to take advantage of it. I'm looking forward to having Intern as a Service to be able to help out autonomously and everything, I hope. Also just related to the topic here of generative AI, I've consistently heard feedback about the difficulty of organizing one's own data within an enterprise in a way that's useful. And so I'm curious what you're hearing from your customers about how they're beginning to and attempting to approach their own generative AI strategies and whether UiPath's automation platform is really able to help customers more holistically across the board with generative AI. Yes. Actually, this is one of the major use cases where automation is used right now in order to find, train, customer lens with even specialized AI. And it's, frankly, one of the hot discussion points with our partners around the world. We had interesting discussions in Japan and in the U.S. with companies like Accenture or Deloitte that are very interested into how they can leverage automation to cleanse the data and to accelerate custom training of a better lens and specialized AI. Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. So it's good to see this net new ARR bounce-back. So as you speak to your customer, what do you think the enterprise spending trend would be next year in terms of priority for automation spending? Yes. I mean we've looked at different analysts in different markets. And many analysts would tell you that they see cloud and data and cyber and automation as the key trends in terms of spending next year. But I'll caution and say customers, as I said earlier, are very thoughtful in how they want to spend, where they want to spend and how they're going to fund it, which benefits us and benefits us in a way that we actually approach customers.
I don't see a significant change in their spending. I do think that customers are going to look to see how AI and AI automation and gen AI can help them drive more efficiency and deeper levels of efficiency in the organization and look at different models when it comes to customers and our customers, how they communicate with customers, how they drive customer journeys as well. And we are focused on helping our customers with that approach in a deep way, also connecting meaningful inputs and outputs in companies around documents and social communication, e-mails into this process, in order to drive real process orchestration at a different level. And Ashim, a follow-up. If I capture your total customer count, it seems like it has come down this quarter. But you guys also had been pretty good on your enterprise segment spending. So wondering like, was there anything different you saw in different segments like small versus mid- to large segment? Yes. Look, we're very pleased with how our enterprise segment is performing. The macroeconomic variability that we've talked about has had a more pronounced impact on the lower end of the market with smaller businesses. And that's where we see the majority of our churn to customers, which Rob mentioned also earlier. Overall, I think our strategy remains consistent. We're focused on the quality of customers, and we define quality as customers with a high propensity to buy. And we like the way the teams are executing against that strategy. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Congrats on solid execution. So two questions. One, where are we in terms of the shortening of the deployment time for the average bot? It seems like it has already improved. And does the rollout of Autopilot help shorten that time even further? And then I have a follow-up for Ashim on purchasing. This is always one of our major product focus on how can we shorten the adoption curve for our customers. And we are already seeing with our Autopilot family that is in private preview some really good results, the initial set of few hundreds of customers that are testing the product. So yes, I would say that this is going to be a significant driver for adoption both for advanced developers, for they will get really increased productivity, to also citizen developers that will get started faster. And also, I would like to mention that training our specialized Document Understanding and Communication Mining models using gen AI, it has already proven. This is actually in production already, and it has been proven to accelerate the deployment quite a bit. Thanks, Daniel. And then, Ashim, on the NRR, it's great to see it having stabilized on an as-reported basis. But it did go down another 2 points as it did last quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. So what are the puts and takes there? You're actually getting slightly easier comps. So what's pulling that down at this point? And what are the things that are working and trying to actually increase in NRR? Yes. I mean, I look at our dollar-based net retention. Adjusted for FX, it's 123%, which in our scale we're very pleased with and continues to be in a best-in-class territory. There will always be a little bit of a law of large numbers. And of course, every quarter's deal mix will change. But overall, we're really pleased with the strategy. I think we've had several marquee deals in the quarter. The penetration and the sale of the platform, as Rob mentioned, we're making -- we continue to make really good progress on. And we see a very good strong performance in the enterprise segment, particularly in North America.
A lot of the -- whatever headwinds we do see, we see really pronounced in the -- more pronounced in the lower end of the market. But overall, our strategy is on customers with a higher propensity to buy. We feel like we're executing against that strategy, and we're seeing that results in the deal quality and the customer quality in the quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Nice quarter here. Your net new ARR is up year-over-year for the first time, I believe, since fourth quarter of fiscal '22, so nice change there on the positive side. I think most of the questions have been on your execution within the quarter. But how about commentary from the demand end of the market? Are you seeing any changes around customers or the environment more mid-market and enterprise? Because you mentioned the down market a couple of different times and the macro impact there. But are you seeing any sort of positive change upward in demand from whether it's existing customers or net new? Yes. I mean I do definitely see positive demand, positive conversations in the market. We feel like we have a significant seat at the table with the AI, OpenAI and ChatGPT kind of discussion that's been taking place. And plus, having the platform has allowed us to have C-level conversations. We have customers now that are really calling us to actually have discussions where they've been using core RPA since 2018, 2019, and they feel like there's an opportunity to expand it. They're not getting all of the -- they're not again as much value as they believe they could get out of it, and those conversations are taking place. And we're able to actually showcase proof points on how to do this. So yes, definitely more positive and definitely feel good about the discussion of how we can help customers and how we are more relevant to the business discussion. Got it. Helpful. And then, Ashim, your current RPO metrics growth rate accelerated pretty meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. Was there any onetime anomalies, I don't know, early renewals or something, that impacted that abnormally in the quarter? Or was that a pretty clean calculation? No major abnormalities like early renewals, et cetera. I think I've mentioned we had several marquee deals in the quarter and a record number of deals above $1 million for a third quarter. So it's execution and really good deal quality that's driving that metric. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. A two-part I'll just ask upfront. Rob, given investments you mentioned in reaching the C-suite, wondering if you can provide us with your perspective around how enterprise customers are approaching IT budget growth into next year and automation as a part of that. And then as a second part, for Ashim, can you comment on the visibility you have into 4Q forecast currently? And any swing factors for us to consider in terms of potential upside there? Yes, Michael. I'll take it, and I'll let Ashim go later. Because we're having these conversations in the boardroom, customer conversation is much more at a C-level suite. We're much earlier in the budget cycle than we've previously been, and we're actually much more important in the budget cycle than I believe we've been previously.
I think there's a couple of really key points that stand out, right? Our industry, how we've driven the industry and how we made ourselves relevant in particular industries and the value proposition there, I do believe that the global systems integrators and how they've come along in support of us, the messaging around SAP has driven well and the platform proof points around do you -- I announced the customer that had $250 million savings in my earnings script. This is what's really allowing us to participate.
And so we feel like we are a meaningful part of where the budgets are going next year. I think everybody is looking at how tight their budgets are and trying to find out how to move from one pocket to another pocket on the innovation side, and we are definitely on the innovation side of customers' thinking.
And then I'll hand it over to Ashim. Yes. So just in terms of our guidance, we've factored in the macroeconomic variability that we've talked about, and it includes the current view of our deal mix. And look at just executing, the teams are focused on executing a good year-end close to the year. And that's what we're focused on. That's what I would comment on that. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. This is actually Jared on for Bryan tonight. In terms of the competitive environment, any changes from what you're seeing from Microsoft ServiceNow or Automation Anywhere? Yes. If I look at ServiceNow, we don't see them in many opportunities. What I will tell you, our ServiceNow Connect is the one of the most -- it is the most popular downloaded connector to UiPath, and we continue to partner with them. And our partnership with Microsoft around Copilot and our Autopilot, the discussions we're having with them continues to be robust. And we're very happy with where we're going with Microsoft and that partnership. And as for a lot of the traditional RPA vendors, I feel now we've broadened our skill set and what we're offering. We don't see them that often anymore. Got it. And then do you have any data points on how the new bundled pricing packages is increasing revenue uplift per client or anything around revenue uplift from the reduction of SKUs as part of the sales refresh? There are no specific that we can point to now. I mean we're looking at the results. It's probably a little bit too early for us to kind of come out with where we are on that. But we do feel good that the early signs of -- I would just simply say, easier for customers to understand, easier for them to move. They definitely like how they're able to use our AI units across multiple products and interchange them as they think of new use cases to advance their business as well. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. This is Strecker Backe for Alex Zukin. Congrats on the next results. I guess, Rob, this one might be for you. Just if we were to like unpack a little bit in like more color just some stuff you saw in the quarter in terms of just either like certain verticals where you saw -- I know you mentioned around like the variable demand, but just kind of comparing from the macro, maybe by a vertical basis, if something has got improved or a little more steady versus the last few quarters you've seen? And then just a bit on renewal behavior in terms of whether it's like buying more licenses, more parts, just kind of how is the kind of renewal conversation in 3Q compared to what you saw at the beginning of the year? Yes. Look, the last quarter was a very strong quarter for public sector, for our federal business actually in the U.K. and in the United States. And that was really because the federal businesses are looking at the platform in a unique way, and we offer some really incredible capabilities around document understanding, connecting that to attended automation, focusing on how citizens can improve. So we've seen us make a marked move in public sector. That also is based on talent and the talent we brought into that environment and how we've driven that talent. And now we actually have some really good industry-based activity in public sector, in revenue and services, in DoD, in Customs, in USDA, that actually can really help all of our public sector activity globally.
When you look at traditional markets -- when you look at more traditional markets, telcos, CPG companies, manufacturing, retail companies, they're all driving efficiencies and driving efficiencies in retailers: how fast it's going to open up stores, how fast it's going to get employees on, how do I make sure my price points are valid and my price points are real and I don't have any price point issues between stores and so on. And actually, automation really drives some significant capabilities in that where we play a significant role.
If you look at capital-intensive telcos, it's all about efficiencies and how can I get competitive advantage efficiencies because my markets are mature and the only way I actually get growth is by beating my competition and moving subscribers from one provider to another provider. And in that space, we are playing pretty well. So it's variable in which industries you're in. It's variable in terms of how they see growth and where they're investing. But there's one common theme across the board, and that's efficiencies.
With renewals, it gives us an opportunity to drive a platform, to drive the platform earlier, to actually start having the discussions with customers many months or many quarters earlier in terms of why I moved to the platform, years of value, ""Let's work on NorthStar with you, let's get in,"" or ""We've got an SAP transformation. We can help you with that as well. Let us bring one of our big global SIs to showcase the transformation."" And that really helps drive a different cadence with renewals. It's not just about renewing what you've already got. It's about renewing what you want to do in the future and how you want to add more business value in the future. And I think we're incredibly good at that right now. That's super clear. And then just, Ashim, as a quick one for you. I mean the incremental margins in the quarter, they were really good. They've been really early year. I guess, if you can remind us just in some of the puts and takes we should keep in mind around how to think about the margin profile kind of in the out-years. Look, I would refer you back to our Investor Day pitch last year where we talked about long-term operating -- just our long-term operating model there. We're really pleased with the execution on the margin front. We've been ahead of that curve in terms of just execution, and we feel really good about our ability to operate with discipline and efficiency while still investing in growth for the company. That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Yes. I just want to say thank you. Thank you to all of you for all your support. It's great to have you all on the call today. Happy holidays to you and your family. May you enjoy a great time. Ho, ho, ho. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Finally, we invite you to join our annual AI Summit, which will be live streamed on our website at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on March 19. You can register at uipath.com. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Rob. Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start by extending a massive thank you to our team. the hard work, dedication and innovative spirit are the driving forces behind our success, and I can't wait to see what we accomplished together in 2025. We reported a strong close to the fiscal year, exceeding our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics, driven by demand for the depth and breadth of our platform and the team's focus on customer success, which is at the core of everything we do. .
Our momentum also reinforces my confidence in the strategic role we play for our customers and the investments we are making in our future. We delivered fourth quarter net new ARR of $86 million, ending the year with a total ARR of $1.46 billion, an increase of 22% year-over-year and record quarterly revenue of $405 million, up 31% year-over-year. On the bottom line, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was a record 27%. This drove fiscal year non-GAAP operating margin to 18%, an increase of over 1,100 basis points year-over-year. This was also our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company.
I am very pleased with the team's ongoing cost management and discipline around capital deployment, which focuses our energy on the right initiatives and sets us up for future success. C-level executives are no longer solely prioritizing digital transformation. They're also prioritizing AI transformation. In a recent UIPath and Bain joint study, The State of AI-powered Automation, 70% of executives asserted that AI-driven automation is either very important or critical in fulfilling their organization's strategic objectives.
Our business automation platform is the foundation to deliver the value across every organization. We make AI actionable, unlocking the promise of this next evolution in technology. And I believe that the combination of AI and automation is the strategic change enabler for our customers. For example, a leading U.S.-based financial services firm and one of our top 25 customers started their automation journey with RPA in 2018 and have since adopted our full platform. This includes process mining, document understanding and test suite.
As the automation program has expanded across business lines, they have over 15,000 robots in production with automations across several thousand processes. And as part of a 7-figure fourth quarter deal, they plan to deploy communications mining in their corporate investment bank, commercial bank and HR department. Our platform drives ROI for both large organizations and smaller ones like innovative toll solutions, a compliance and toll management solution for trucking fleets, which is leverage automation to drive efficient growth.
In the fourth quarter, they invested in additional AI-powered automation, including document understanding to automate complex toll documents for their customers, test suite for QA and application testing and automation hub to grow and prioritize their automation pipeline. The value of our business automation platform has never been more evident to regional partners, global SIs, go-to-market partners like SAP, who understand the power of AI combined with automation and the value it provides to our joint customers.
Our SAP partnership is progressing well, and we are pleased with the momentum and pipeline generation across geographies. During the quarter, we continued to see combined success in closing deals, including one of Switzerland's largest retail and wholesale companies, a new logo to UiPath. Disappointed with the performance of a competitor's RPA and application performance monitoring solutions, they are migrating both of these to UiPath. They are also in the process of rolling out document understanding to automate invoice processing with the goal of expanding company-wide. Another great example combines the power of UiPath, SAP and EY. Working with EY, Marks & Spencer selected UiPath based on our ability to both automate and test across all applications.
There was a plan to utilize UiPath to assist in their migration to SAP S/4HANA RISE to automate finance processes with the goal of reducing complexity and vendor spend. Partners also help customers build a holistic approach to automation. Together with Deloitte, and C-level sponsorship, Indosat, a leading Indonesian communications provider and a UiPath customer since 2021 expanded to the full platform this quarter. They are looking to drive further operational efficiencies, increased revenue growth and improve their customer and employee experience. Using our NorthStar program, the team crafted a 3-year road map, encompassing hundreds of automations across all business lines within the organization.
Beyond Indosat's internal use, we are forming a strategic go-to-market collaboration, expanding our presence in Indonesia to empower local businesses to revolutionize operations, equip workers to focus on higher-value tasks. And in partnership with GSI, we supported TD Bank through our NorthStar program to create a list of top automation opportunities across various lines of business, focusing on improving customer experience, empowering colleagues, optimizing controls, driving productivity and cost efficiencies. And as a result, they have expanded the UiPath deployment in this quarter as they look to accelerate this and scale the automation program across the bank.
We also recently announced the first of its kind co-innovation market collaboration between UiPath and Deloitte. Deloitte's Smart Finance for growth companies leverages automation built by UiPath and customized by Deloitte into value-driven packages tailored for the needs of early-stage innovative companies, which require speed and agility. And finally, we continue to deepen our partnership with Microsoft to build best-in-class automation experiences and integration. This brings AI-powered automation to customers using Microsoft Azure. We see opportunities to expand its collaboration to accelerate our joint customers move to the cloud with AI-infused industry solutions and enterprise modernization with Microsoft. This quarter, we have some notable joint wins, including an expansion deal on Microsoft Marketplace.
This includes a British multinational company, which is in the process of migrating to the cloud while growing the automation program. We plan to continue making strategic investments in our partner ecosystem in 2025, focused on cultivating quality partners with expertise in automation, which can fully enable our customers to realize the benefits of our platform. This updated approach includes a dedicated partner deal desk as well as new enablement plans and certifications to better align UiPath with our most trusted partners as we work side by side.
The momentum we bring into 2025 was evident at our February DevCon event held in India hosted by Daniel and the team more than 1,000 professionals, including developers, partners and customer specialists learn about new features that bring AI-powered productivity to the developer community. They also participate in over 24 breakout sessions, featuring growth products like intelligence document processing or IDP and Test Suites. 18 months ago, we drove the evolution of the automation market from RPA to a full AI-powered business automation platform.
Our growth products have played a key role in our platform's evolution, setting us apart from the competition and serving as the link that connects AI and automation into actionable results. Our platform also enables us to close larger, more strategic deals. Almost every organization has to process an onslaught of forms, invoices and documents which is why [indiscernible] understanding resonates so well with customers, particularly in finance, insurance, health care and public sector.
In the fourth quarter, 65 of our top 100 deals included intelligent document processing, a testament to customer engagement and the part of our platform. Our unique approach combines specialized AI and more than 70 pre-trained models and virtualized package solutions to help customers streamline processes, identify continuous process improvements and rapidly scale the document understanding projects. At CareSource, a customer since 2019, [ our ] platform has played a vital role in their digital transformation journey. Leveraging core automation and document understanding, they've been able to efficiently process over 2.5 million transactions in 2023. Given their success to date, they expanded the document understanding initiative across finance and claims processing departments and plan to move into medical records processing.
The combination of IDP in automation not only drives efficiency and quality, but allows UiPath customers to change how they interact with the external stakeholders. At our AI Summit next week, we are planning to unveil a new UiPath large language model, which combines open-source LLMs, our specialized AI, proprietary [indiscernible] business documents and communication data. This robust LLM, combined with our industry-leading IDP solution provides customers access to what we believe is the most powerful documents and communications AI model on the market, and we plan to continue to invest to widen our leadership in the IDP space. Test Suite, which initially emerged as a tool for automation testing is quickly becoming a disruptive application testing market, with Test Suite customers growing more than 75% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
A recent UiPath and IDC joint study found that customers Using our capabilities have experienced, on average, more than $4 million in annualized benefits, a 529% 3-year ROI and have only 6 months payback on investment. A great example of the significant ROI Test Suite delivers to our customers is a Fortune 100 global Digital Communications Corporation. In just 6 months, they were able to automate 80% of their 3,000 end-to-end test cases in the global logistics department, improving test coverage from 30% to 93%. This resulted in significantly fewer operational incidents and enable them to keep their complex IT landscape running smoothly.
We expect returns like these to be further accelerated with the introduction of our latest innovation, Autopilot, our newest set of AI-powered experiences that leverage generative AI specialized AI and automation across the platform. Autopilot makes it easier for people of all skills to build automations, accelerate time to development and discover process improvements. Both Autopilots for studio, where we have the largest number of preview participants in company history and Autopilot for tests are in public preview, while Autopilot for process mining and Autopilot for Communications Mining in private preview.
Lastly, on the technology front, our business automation platform is now available on the Google Cloud Marketplace, making it easier for joint customers to deploy and scale the automation initiatives on Google Cloud infrastructure. To help customers and prospects get the most out of our capabilities, we plan to continue our investments in targeted sales areas [indiscernible] our resources towards large enterprise customers where we see the biggest opportunity for expansion. This includes investments in growth process specialists, sales engineers to support our customers and further industry verticalization in areas like financial services, insurance, health care and public sector.
This approach has been instrumental in driving momentum in North America, including large strategic deals, and we are investing in other regions where we are seeing early traction. Our team did an excellent job of positioning our platform for a strategic customer in the U.K., which resulted in a competitive displacement of Blue Prism. The customer will be migrating their more than 250 processes to UiPath. They're also creating an intelligent automation team to strategically manage the UiPath deployment while working to identify use cases for communication mining and document understanding. This kind of industry focus is also driving growth in our public sector business. This quarter, the Scottish government doubled their adoption of UiPath on renewal as we continue to automate core areas of finance and HR. They're also expanding their reach to additional departments and agencies that include Social Security Scotland, Student Awards, Scottish Public Pension Agency and agriculture and rural economy.
In addition, they are scaling our AI products, particularly document understanding and process discovery. And in our U.S. federal government vertical, UiPath partner, FedResults was awarded an enterprise software initiative agreement for UiPath products and services by the U.S. Department of Defense for up to $95 million. The 5-year base period agreement will streamline the acquisition process and reduce the cost of delivery of UiPath products and services to the DoD, Department of Defense, intelligence community and the U.S. Coast Guard. This will enable these federal organizations to significantly accelerate the adoption of UiPath and put AI to work in a safe and secure manner.
Before I hand over the call to Ashim, I'd like to personally welcome June Yang to our Board of Directors. June is a proven, strategic and transformational executive who brings extensive experience in AI and cloud as well as decades of experience in fostering emerging technologies. I am confident we will benefit from our technical expertise and industry insights and look forward to many years of collaboration.
In summary, we delivered a strong [indiscernible] year, demonstrating the continued momentum of our AI-powered business automation platform. We're transforming industries and revolutionizing the way businesses operate. And as we look to 2025, I believe our strategic investments in innovation and our go-to-market ecosystem position us well for continued momentum. And with that, I'll hand over to Ashim. Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year. Please note that year-over-year foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. Turning to the quarter. We had a strong close to the year, which is a testament to the team's execution and will continue to be a variable environment and our laser focus on operational excellence and profitable growth initiatives. ARR totaled $1.464 billion, an increase of 22% driven by net new ARR of $86 million. Our cloud-first approach is driving automation -- is driving adoption across our customer base, and we ended the year with over $650 million in cloud ARR, up 70% year-over-year.
A great example is a global media and entertainment company. After successfully completing their cloud migration, they expanded this quarter selecting UiPath as their preferred automation vendor due to the breadth of our platform capabilities, specifically testing and specialized AI products like document understanding. A major Japanese telecommunications operator expanded to the full platform during the fourth quarter. They plan to migrate the cloud -- to the cloud and drive their automation program across multiple divisions by leveraging document understanding, communications mining and process mining with the goal of an additional 1 million hours saved.
We ended the quarter with 10,830 customers, including new logos like Five Guys, Workday, Coca-Cola Beverages Florida, Allegis, Global Solutions and Tesco, a testament to our strategy of acquiring enterprise customers with a propensity to invest.
The vast majority of customer attrition continues to be in smaller customers, which in aggregate, represent an immaterial portion of the overall business. Customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 2054, while customers with $1 million or more in ARR grew 26% to 288. Our largest customers are also continuing to expand on our platform. And during fiscal year 2024, customers with $5 million or more in ARR, grew 50%. Moving on, double dollar-based gross retention of 98% continues to be best in class, and our dollar-based net retention rate as of the fourth quarter was 119%. Expansions are driven by the quick time to ROI and the broad applicability of our automation. At Fujitsu, automation has revolutionized their business operations globally across their accounting, HR and IT departments.
With C-level sponsorships, they are incorporating the UiPath platform into their company-wide digital transformation project, including automating mission-critical systems such as Salesforce, ServiceNow and SAP. Fourth quarter revenue grew to $405 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We had good linearity in the quarter as we benefited from a strong calendar year close and demand from our enterprise customers. Please remember that under ASC 606, revenue growth rates vary quarter-to-quarter depending on timing of license deliveries and renewals.
Looking at revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, our revenue and ARR growth continues to be aligned. Total revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 24% year-over-year. As of the end of fourth quarter, our customers with ARR of $100,000 accounted for approximately 86% of total revenue, while customers with ARR of $1 million or more accounted for 52% of our revenue. Strategic investments made by customers in our platform also drove growth in remaining performance obligations, which increased to $1.16 billion, up 30%.
Current RPO increased to $707 million, up 26%. Turning to expenses. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 89%, driven by cost control and efficiencies. Software gross margin was 92%. Fourth quarter operating expenses were $250 million, highlighting the leverage in our business and our commitment to expense management and operating discipline. We ended the year with 4,035 total employees. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company, delivering operating income of $15 million. This included $89 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Full year GAAP operating loss was $165 million, including $372 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income was $111 million, resulting in a fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 27%, reflecting both our operational rigor and fourth quarter seasonality. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $233 million. Full year non-GAAP operating margin increased over 1,100 basis points year-over-year to 18%, a testament to the team's disciplined execution and well ahead of the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year. I'm really pleased with our adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow generation for the fourth quarter and full year.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $146 million. And for the full fiscal year, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $309 million. As of January 31, we had $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt. Under our $500 million buyback program, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $19.21 from November 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024. Since January 31, under a 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased an additional 938,000 shares at an average price of $23.46 through March 12, 2024.
Now turning to guidance. I'm going to start with some color. We are initiating full year guidance for ARR, revenue and non-GAAP operating income above current expectations. Starting on the top line. As the business has grown past $1 billion and has matured into a consistent seasonal pattern with the second half of the year being stronger than the first. This is a reflection of our renewal portfolio, which is weighted to our fourth quarter, consistent with other companies in the software industry and our growing U.S. federal vertical. As a result, we expect first half revenue to be approximately $675 million, first half net new ARR to be approximately $105 million and second half net new ARR and revenue to reflect similar seasonality as fiscal year 2024.
On the bottom line, as I mentioned earlier, we significantly outperformed our non-GAAP operating margin expectations, which we laid out at the beginning of this fiscal year, and I'm really proud of the team for this achievement. We have a strong business model with high gross margins and increasing economies of scale, which when combined with our disciplined operating cadence, we expect to deliver considerable shareholder value over time.
Our platform is highly differentiated and customers are making meaningful commitments to UiPath. We don't just allow customers to use AI, we enable them to take action. We believe there is a tremendous opportunity in front of us, and we plan to continue to make strategic investments in technology like IDP and generative AI as well as our go-to-market resources to help capture this large and growing market.
With this as the background, we plan to deliver growth and profitability in fiscal year 2025 with our goal of driving at least 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion year-over-year. Turning to the specifics of our guide, which assumes the macroeconomic environment continues to be variable. For the first fiscal quarter 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $330 million to $335 million; ARR in the range of $1.508 billion to $1.513 billion, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $55 million, and we expect first quarter basic share count to be approximately 570 million shares. For the fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.560 billion. ARR in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.730 billion, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $295 million.
Before I close, I want to leave you with a few modeling points. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 85% as we scale our cloud platform and offerings. Non-GAAP operating income to reflect similar seasonality to our top line metrics. Fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of approximately $350 million, also to follow normal seasonal patterns. And we're assuming FX to be net neutral year-over-year. Lastly, we are committed to managing stock-based compensation, and for the fiscal year 2025, we expect dilution to be approximately 3% year-over-year. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator. As a reminder, Daniel is in the room with us to answer questions as well. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kurt Materne with Evercore ISI. Rob, I was wondering, based on the study you referenced earlier, when your customers are thinking about automation and sort of their AI strategy, do they need to wait on automation to get their AI strategy mapped out or vice versa. I'm just kind of curious how -- there's a lot of experimentation going on with Gen AI right now. I was just kind of wondering what that means in terms of people making bigger bets with you all. Obviously, this quarter looks good. But just wondering, if you could add some more color there because I think the cadence is what I think some folks get tripped up on a little bit. Thanks, Kirk. Yes, we feel -- and in my discussions -- I've just come back from Europe. In my discussions in Europe, what you see now is the Head of AI hubs and the Chief AI Officer calling us into conversations to expand automation using Gen AI and they really like how we've infused AI into our solution and they get immediate benefits from the Gen AI work that we're doing today. So we see more and more automation expanding to the broader set of C-level executives in companies today.
And that was what we positioned the platform early on. And I think we're getting a tailwind with AI and automation in that space in terms of the discussions that we're having today. And we're very real and practical in what customers are looking for. We're not looking to deliver use cases to them. We're actually showing that our product infused with AI add significant more value and adds it much faster. If I could just ask a quick follow-up for Ashim. Ashim, I know you managed the business to ARR, but obviously a pretty big jump in licenses this quarter. Can you just address that? Just what sort of drove that? And then obviously, I realized it doesn't have much to do with the go-forward ARR guidance, but just curious about what drove that this quarter. Yes. I mean it was a mix of various things. I mean fourth quarter is typically a heavier quarter for us in general. And then we did have a significant number of license deliveries. Some of that was from prior deals, but the volume of current quarter deals, obviously was very good as well. Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Congrats on strong results. Clearly, the combination of AI and automation is helping raise the profile of the broader platform. But I'm curious, when you look across the base, are there any specific use cases that, that infusion of AI and automation is really resonating with, whether it be front office or back office or any vertical use cases that's helping you maybe break down new doors for the platform? Yes, I would say, we clearly feel that in a health care insurance space, we are pretty advanced with our intelligent document processing and what we're doing in that space. We also see, as I mentioned earlier, Test Suite taking on broader applicability, more than just automation testing and becoming more relevant in that space. And then we mentioned a little earlier as well in that our autopilot preview customers. It's the largest in the history of UiPath that we have preview customers having a look at it. And in some cases, up to 1,000 companies are looking at Autopilot. So in all of those aspects, it's adding more value to the platform.
And I would actually add to that discussion is because the platform has a discovery piece to it where process mining and Task Mining, Communication Mining is able to uncover automation, together with that process tied to the Gen AI and our specialized AI capabilities, I think many, many companies are now starting to see the benefit of actually driving it faster. Okay. Helpful. And then it was great to hear that comment on the 1,000 early adopters of Autopilot. Just curious what the early feedback that you've gotten from those early adopters have been? And then anything that you've seen in terms of the speed at which those customers are now able to develop new automations after adopting Autopilot? Yes, I can take this one. We are seeing quite good retention week of the week of the people that are using the Autopilot. And for instance, in the Autopilot for Developers, we are seeing an acceptance rate of in excess of 65% of the automation that we are proposing to them, which is quite good. It's really early to come with a number estimate on how much they save in the development time.
But we feel there is material savings. And in our industry, the implementation and maintenance of automation is the largest part of total cost of ownership. So we estimate really a broad adoption that will increase also the adoption of our platform. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. And I'll add my congrats. So Rob, you have this very strong partnership with SAP. Clearly, you have some momentum with the Test Suite. Could you comment on the tailwind that you're seeing for the ERP cloud migrations. And I'm wondering if you -- since that tailwind can grow into the SAP end of support deadline, but there's a pretty big one, I believe, coming up in 2027. We feel really positive about where we are with the SAP partnership. I feel like the new logos, the Swiss large retailer is one, what we're doing with Marks and Spencer, is another one. In both cases, Test Suite is predominant or is a dominant factor together with the rest of the platform. So we feel really, really positive about that. But I would also not underestimate announcement with Google Cloud  and the Marketplace, right? I mean, many, many companies are now starting to see that when they combine the automation play together with SAP and the S/4HANA RISE momentum, which has, as you said, an end date, they also want to benefit from the investments in the marketplace. And we feel like that those investments with marketplace will also benefit us in the future. Okay. And as a quick follow-up for Ashim. I'm looking at the net new ARR, it grew year-over-year in Q3. It almost got there in Q4, but it still looks good. You're guiding that this fiscal year, I think you're guiding the net new similar to what it was in FY '24. I'm wondering what ingredients you think might have to align to see that grow -- sort of get back to pretty meaningful growth. For instance, if we do end up with a soft landing scenario this year, then do you think that that might be in the cards with some good execution? Mark, the way I look at it is we continue to make great progress as a company. I look at last year and this first half, if you look at the net new ARR, it was down, the second half was basically close to neutral. As you mentioned, when you look at our guidance right now, at the midpoint, we are growing net new ARR overall and in the first quarter. I think we continue to execute. Our strategy is really clear. The value proposition and our product road map is also very clear. And I think if we continue to execute, we have a lot of optimism. That being said, our guide is our guide, and we are very clear in terms of the assumptions that are there. And our focus is just on executing this quarter and continuing to execute on our strategy. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC. What really set out to me too, Ashim, I think you noted your Cloud ARR was $650 million. I believe you said it for 70%, if I wrote that down right. I'm sort of curious, how should we think about that mix in fiscal '25 because it feels like that could be a significant portion of reacceleration as well. Yes. Like our flex offering is really popular with customers, and we continue to see customer momentum moving to the cloud. So we feel very good about that momentum. I would say the mix and the growth rates would consider -- we'll continue on the trends that we've seen historically and the overall trend of the company as we disclose the numbers every quarter. So I think we feel very good about it. That's great to hear. And the other thing, obviously, the progress on the margins is great and the 100 bps is really good to hear this year. I think  seeing GAAP profitable in 4Q was also really nice. Thoughts on GAAP profitability in fiscal '25. I mean do you think it could [indiscernible], I don't know if it's every quarter, but just sort of thoughts on GAAP profitability on a go-forward basis. look, we obviously don't guide to GAAP profitability, so I won't comment there. What I would say is 2 things. We have really good cost discipline and capital allocation. And for us, whether that is cash that is going out the door or whether that is equity, we look at them as equal components of capital now, and that's what we're focused on. Really pleased with the progress in terms of just overall GAAP profitability even for the year, cutting the overall GAAP operating loss significantly and like you said, achieving GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter. We'll have seasonal patterns, right, that will be a part of that in different quarters. And I just like the overall trend line. We can give more information as we need -- we'll update more information at the appropriate times in terms of long-term margins. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Rob, I had a question actually on the partners. You mentioned, I think, Deloitte and Ernst & Young as highlighting some deals for you guys this quarter. Broadly, where do we stand in terms of partner contribution? I know it's been a big focus for the company. But in terms of partner source revenue or partner influenced revenue, how does that look this year in terms of mix? And where do you plan on taking that to going into fiscal year '25? Yes. I mean we don't disclose, obviously, those numbers, but we feel really strong about where we are with Accenture and EY, PwC and Deloitte. Many of those programs that we're talking about, like, there's a super exciting program, [indiscernible] Deloitte and focusing on fast-growing companies using their smart finance solution, combining it with automation and then repackaging it into a vertical solution. We feel those are really going to drive activity. We also feel that -- our partners are extremely important, and we're driving more and more partner connections, over 70% of our deals are touched by partners. And we'll continue to see us focused on driving partners in the future as well, both the channel and the GSIs. Understood. And then a follow-up question, maybe maybe for Daniel or Ashim, it's about cloud and that sort of 650, which is by math, north of 40% of total ARR, which sort of means that you guys are going to cross the CASM eventually relatively soon to become a majority cloud company. As you think through some of the things that are coming online with some of the Gen AI initiatives and the copilot initiatives that you have, if those start to gain traction, does that come through the cloud line and essentially that's where we're going to one way to sort of track your Gen AI traction by the mix of cloud steadily increasing? Or just how do we think about the cloud mix evolving from here as you drive the platform story? Yes. I would say all of our new offerings, we have a cloud-first mentality in terms of that, and many of the offerings start with the cloud. So of course, that means that the cloud mix as we continue to scale, we feel optimistic will continue on the same trend that is there. I do want to remind everybody, we have a hybrid kind of cloud environment. So from a SaaS headwind standpoint, I would look at that as not impacted by that mix shifting as we move up that area. So from that perspective, we feel very confident about the direction of cloud overall. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. So I appreciate the document understanding at that point and the test traction [indiscernible] traction you mentioned. I'm curious if you could comment more on the mix of deal wins you may have signed in 4Q with clients attaching the full platform or maybe the mix of the pipeline where you see clients pursuing that holistic approach. Any further commentary you could share there? Yes, Bryan, I think I mentioned 65 out of 100  of our top deals had some sort of the platform attached to those deals. So that kind of showcases. I think if you look at our deals above $1 million, I think that will tell you a story there. We also had -- we more than doubled our deals above $5 million, which will tell a story around the platform as well. And I think those are proof points around where we are with the platform. Also, the messaging around the GSIs, the partners, that's where the platform becomes even more important. In my discussions, though, I was in Saudi Arabia, we are met with numerous of the financial institutions and insurance companies and many of the Kingdom of Saudi government officials.
I mean they actually recognize the platform and the relevance of the platform. And actual fact, one of the largest banks in Saudi are just -- was about to sign with a competitor for RPA. And after they saw the platform, changed their mind completely, almost on the spot and we're seeing more and more of that kind of interaction with customers. So in my discussions with customers, I'm extremely positive in how we are enabling them to do digital transformation faster. We're enabling them to get value quicker and the most important thing, they're getting speed into what they want to do in their businesses to change their business without having to touch many of their systems, they can get the value. And many of the comments I made was around NorthStar and how we did that -- how are we doing that. Okay. Very clear. And then just on the demand front. So I understand -- I appreciate the variable comment there. Can you talk maybe more about as you going through 1Q and as you're planning for the year? Or what you may be seeing by region or verticals, those have been maybe more aggressively leaning in versus those that are more cautious? Yes, look, we feel -- when you look at the region, we feel really good about our continued strength in North America and continuing to drive where we've been focused on. I don't think public sector is a region, but I would say -- if you look at public sector, vertically what we're doing in the U.K., the Scottish government, the U.S. federal environment, super, super positive results. And I would say you can extrapolate that globally. We have both -- we have a solution that is really applicable in markets that are concerned about sovereignty.
You take the French for instance where we're able to deploy in a cloud-based model, to their liking, the deployment model of choice. So that's hugely beneficial. We like what we saw in Japan. We continue to see significant progress in Europe. Our leadership there is really strengthened, and they are delivering consistently every quarter. And when you deliver consistently, you can start really attacking growth and drive growth. And so we see an opportunity for AI environment, combined with the platform to markedly change the trajectory in the future. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Terrific results. I will in the spirit of keep my question to one. Rob, I wanted to come back on what you're just talking about with Bryan. You mentioned 65 of the top 100 deals had some element of platform. I wonder if you could expand the answer a bit, but just talk a little bit about what the penetration is versus your installed base? Because I would think there's a lot of room for opportunities there. And any difference that you could highlight, say, on DBNR or gross retention or size of deals for those customers that are adopting some element, not necessarily the full element but some element of the platform versus those that are not. Yes, appreciate the question. So yes, when we look at -- we said our focus was to -- to target the high-propensity customers that would invest in automation in a significant way. And we feel that that's coming through with our $1 million customers and deals above $5 million, it's definitely coming through. When you look at customers in terms of the platform and solution sets, I would say, IDP and test is a driver for the platform.
But once they've seen what they can do with intelligent document processing, they want to then start to uncover more and more opportunities. And I would use an example of Indosat, where the CEO of Indosat looked at what we can do with the NorthStar with opportunities in process mining and communication mining and getting that whole organization behind understanding how to drive efficiencies and more importantly, look for new revenue streams. That's what excites the customers. So I would -- we're in the early stages of driving the platform through the customer base. I feel like many, many more customers will take on the platform in a significant way. And there's a lot of opportunity in the future. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. This is [ Adam Bucheon ] for Brad Sills. So you guys have all done a great job selling back into the customer base and that's been a relative focus. How are you thinking about the go-to-market mission for FY '25? Yes, [ Brett ], so pretty much the same execution, productivity, continue to drive the platform, driving more industry verticalization as we see more and more solutions are successful and then bringing them globally into different markets. We are investing in product specialists in these areas where companies are interested in understanding more. So we'll see some more product specialists in our growth products in the platform. But we feel really good about all the go-to-market changes we have made and the execution of those changes. And so in 2025, it's all about execution. Our next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. I'm risk of being repetitive here because I want to go back to a theme of question I asked last quarter because there's a lot happening with autonomous agents since we really last called out -- like last night, Cognition, the startup launched their new AI software engineer and some posted some demos about it. And with this, you can see that some of these new AI initiative, generative AI initiatives are giving computers access to work environment, machine vision and a number of things here. So I'd like to ask, how are you thinking about the cooperative or even competitive environment for UiPath platform with the rise of this kind of autonomous, self-reasoning technology? Yes. Let me take this one. We are thinking quite a lot in how we can build our own, what we call, like digital assistants. So we put together the best team that we have in UiPath, the best AI team. And we are working to build our own like foundational model that combine the knowledge of a subject matter expert, like a knowledge of how to use the system applications that facilitate these type of tasks. Where the company are in a great position to build this type of assistance. We have tremendous access to computer screens, application data. Our computer vision service is one of the most used -- we have -- we scaled actually to like 5 million calls a month, and it's growing up consistently month-over-month.
In the end, all these autonomous agents require a great platform to operate on. You will have a platform to ensure the security, the governance, the audit that are required to performing autonomous work. And this is where I think that we really shine combining our great offering, our existing data and building the trends on the top of the platform. Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Congrats from me as well on the GAAP profitability. Rob, it's a question for you in terms of just the SAP relationship.  It seems like low-hanging fruit around test suite. But I'm curious, is the relationship evolving? And are you seeing opportunities or signed business whereby they're taking your platform and actually extending the core as they upgrade to S/4HANA. So let's not just test automation, it's actually helping build new -- almost business logic, if you will, with your platform. Just would love to learn more about how this could expand and become extensible Yes. I mean I think the good way to look at it is SAP is focused on clean core. We help clean core in a significant way where you can build automations on top and combined together with SAP processes and automation, customers can get a clean core, and they can get what they need from the business model. When you combine with Deloitte, taking the advanced methodology, the SAP advancement methodology and they're combining UiPath automation on top, so they can take both to the customer together, it tells you that the combination of both is actually how -- where customers will get the benefit.
The customers that we see on the migration that are also driven from Test is not only Test, they're looking at full automation, and that's why they actually are combining UiPath, when we showcase how we demo the combination of running an SAP invoice creation process and automation on top of that, extracting information from documents and automatically creating those invoice orders, customers are like, wow. And so that's the process we're going through. And when you start looking at new logos, Marks and spencer and the customer in Switzerland, these are significant organizations and they are significant new logos for us to continue to win. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. This is [ Ethan Rock ] on for Alex Zukin. So I just want to ask you, you called out a lot of success in more complex industries like financial services, health care, life science, public sector. I was just curious, how much of these more strategic discussions with larger customers is kind of the pull around people looking to explore more with AI versus the push from some of just the better go-to-market execution you've spoken about? And then as we think about guidance, I just want to double click on Mark's question. I'm just curious like based on all what you're seeing with demand and just on execution standpoint, like what's giving confidence in that guide for the net new ARR for fiscal '25, the puts and takes whether it's around large customer momentum, more success in certain verticals? Just anything you can share there? Yes. So let me start off and say, look, there's no doubt there's better execution, right? There's no doubt that's what we said we wanted to achieve better execution. And we also wanted to make certain that the platform was relevant for C-level executives. And there's no doubt that the whole AI movement that's happened in the past 12 months, all of those pieces together has helped UiPath move forward in a dramatically better way. And we'll continue to do that. The reason why our AI story resonates not only with the automation folks and the AI folks is because we're able to showcase how you take a solution like it and use generative AI and improve the performance of test manual testing multiple times, including when you take -- as I said, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, when they look at the invoice and they're looking at English and Arabic, and we're able to take both of those in their language and able to actually use automation, AI-based automation to decipher it and uncovered if and when it's only 75% visible, we're able to actually almost get it 100%.
Customers are absolutely blown. Then they look at the opportunity. What else is out there? What else can you do for us?  We've got all of these opportunities and what we see is pretty exciting for us. And then it's a question of how long will it take to deliver it. And that's where we -- the creativity of automation together with AI delivers what I've always said, customers need speed and agility to deliver results that they need to date. And I would just say from the guidance perspective, a lot of our confidence comes to actually based on what Rob is saying and what we're seeing in the market. We always guide to what's in front of us. So we look at our pipeline, we look at kind of the business, how the business is progressing. And we had a really great year last year, and we feel like we have continued momentum going into this year, and so we feel good about our guide. That will be our final question. Our next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Congrats on the strong end of the year. I want to keep on the AI topic. I'd love to hear any updates around how you're seeing customers leverage the UiPath platform to build their own custom Gen AI applications. And similarly, to the extent that AI is helping bend the curve make business automation easier to adopt, curious if this can finally really speed up the deployment and lower the need of extensive services to adopt your guys' platform. Yes, I can give you an interesting example that we are seeing in health care provider. We help them with building a RAG-based search, which is like retrieval augmented generative AI. And the imagine patient that has to fill out a formula. And then it goes to -- it converts into a claim and it has to match with a certain type of procedure. So this is the -- that was one type of example that we are seeing, and there are many others in this regard. And I think it proves, again, the point that generative AI combined with specialized AI is really helping us to go more towards automating end-to-end processes. And that is really -- in the end, it results in a much better value for our customers Okay. I think that -- with that, that's the last question. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. We really appreciate you taking the time, and thank you again This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ali Fani, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Elias. You may begin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review UiPath's First quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, which we announced in our earnings press release issued after the close of the market today. On the call with me are Daniel Dines, UiPath's Founder and Chief Innovation Officer; and Ashim Gupta, Chief Financial Officer, to deliver our prepared comments and answer questions. Our earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations we will be discussing non-GAAP metrics on today's call. This afternoon's call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and grow our platform as well as our financial guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2025. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, and therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on these statements.
For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, and our subsequent reports filed with the SEC including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2024, to be filed with the SEC.
Forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. I would like to highlight that this webcast is being accompanied by slides. We will post the slides and a copy of our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website immediately following the conclusion of this call. In addition, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated.
Now I would like to hand the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Elyse. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to start today by addressing the announcement we made this afternoon and then I'll give a quick summary of our first quarter results and revised outlook including an update on our path forward. I will then walk through a few highlights from the quarter before I hand it over to Ashim to go through our financials and guidance in more detail.
As you may have seen in our press release this afternoon, Rob Enslin is leaving the company and has also resigned as a member of the Board. Rob played a significant role over the last 2 years, and I know I'm speaking for the entire company when I say that we are very grateful for his -- for his contribution to UiPath. With Rob leaving the company, I'm excited to step back into the CEO role and look forward to leading us through our next phase of profitable growth and innovation.
During the past year, I had the privilege of immersing myself in our product and engineering efforts. This experience gives me invaluable clarity on our path forward. At the time, when companies are looking to optimize costs and drive efficiencies without sacrificing innovation, especially around generative our platform enables them to harness the power of the AI to achieve actionable outcomes. As we look to the future of automation, our focus isn't just on boosting productivity and efficiency, it's also about redefining what's possible with the breadth of our AI-powered platform and capability. The impact that the combination of generative AI and automation provides our customers a significant and it's expanding from our early customers like SMBC and Orange to customers that have grown and expanded significantly over the last year, like USDA and ACA, they continue to emphasize how the combination of automation and AI deliver through our platform is transforming their business and enabling them to thrive in today's environment.
We view generative AI as a secular tailwind that will continue to benefit our business and the catalysts were continuing to innovate across our platform to expand our competitive moat. Turning to our first quarter results. ARR grew 21% year-over-year to $1.508 billion, driven by first quarter net new ARR of $44 million excluding the FX headwind of $3 million net new ARR totaled $47 million. Revenue grew to $335 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, normalizing for the FX headwind of approximately $8 million, revenue grew 18% year-over-year. While our top line results were generally in line with our guidance range, we are not satisfied with our performance and I'd like to give you more color on a few key factors that impacted first quarter results.
First, while we had a healthy start to the quarter, we saw the pace slow as we progressed through the second half of March and into April. This was primarily due to the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment that we see persisting with mid-market customers as well as a change in customer behavior, particularly with large multiyear deals.
As a result, several large expansion opportunities closed with the reduced size were pushed out of the quarter. Second, we saw inconsistent execution, which included contract execution challenges on large deals and certain sales compensation changes, which we are working to rectify. While customer behavior is often a function of the broader macroeconomic environment, execution is something we can control. And we recognize that we need to improve predictability on large multiyear deals.
Third, our growth products such as IDP and test automation are producing positive results. However, there is a need to have a deeper execution strategy to scale these products to reach their full potential. And lastly, the investments we have made to reaccelerate growth have fallen short of our expectations, made us less agile in responding to customer needs and created short-term pressure on operating margins, all of which we are committed to rectifying.
Now let me address our outlook going forward. Our revised second quarter and fiscal 2025 guidance are not where we expect them to be. That being said, we don't expect the macro environment to improve materially in the near term. And we believe it is prudent to guide assuming variability we saw at the end of the first quarter will continue. It also takes into account the leadership transition, which can create some short-term disruption. As we look to the future, we are laser focused on enhancing our execution including improved sales linearity and deal scrutiny, driving higher efficiency across sales and the broader organization and driving a deeper and more execution orienting strategy for our growth products. We are also shifting the way we engage with customers to reinvigorate our line of business engagement with an industry tailored approach.
Lastly, we plan to go back to our roots, building a truly customer-centric organization, we are co-innovating with our customers and partners is at the heart of everything we do. We believe that this foundational work will help us better address customer needs, accelerate adoption of our platform and position us to drive market share gains over the medium and long term.
I want to be clear, we are optimistic about the role of our business automation platform plays in digital transformation. The core foundation of our business remains strong, and we are making progress on our long-term strategic plan, which includes releasing innovative new features and products like Autopilot continuing to deepen our relationships with meaningful partners like SAP and building a strong community of developers.
Lastly, despite some of the top line challenges, we are still expecting to generate $300 million of non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow for the full fiscal year 2025. Turning to a few highlights from the quarter. I am energized by the incredible events we hosted, including our annual AI Summit, which once again proved to be a great success with over 5,000 registered attendees. We introduced new innovations focused around the key factors that business leaders are looking for when they embed AI in their automation program, business context, AI model flexibility, actionability and trust. These innovations included our family of large language models, or LLMs, [indiscernible], which combine the best of generative AI and specialized AI to empower our customers to understand the process any document and a huge variety of message types by narrowing the focus, but retaining the vast power of Gen AI, our specialized LLM significantly outperformed the output accuracy of currently available out of the box at the land. We also introduced context grounding a new feature within the UiPath AI trust layer that helps businesses improve the accuracy of Gen AI models by extracting information from company-specific data sets.
And lastly, we announced exciting new updates for Autopilot, including the release of Autopilots for developers and testers into general availability in June. We have seen tremendous interest from our customers across diverse industries ranging from technology and automotive to pharmaceuticals and advertising and including some of the largest companies in the world, such as [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. While still in its early days, Autopilot has already garnered positive feedback and excitement among customers for its innovative use of generative AI to take action across application stacks lowering barriers to entry and accelerating time to value. On the go-to-market front, momentum continued with our first UiPath on tour event, AI at work public sector in Washington, D.C. The energy and engagement in the room were palpable with over 1,000 public sector leaders and implementation partners in attendance. It was truly inspiring to witness firsthand how our platform is empowering public sector agencies to modernize their IT infrastructure and nothing gave the cloud with confidence.
We also had the opportunity to highlight our recently achieved Fabron authorization. This milestone creates opportunities for public sector organizations to elevate their operations through the transformative power of automation, and we are already seeing customer interest closing several deals in the first quarter, including an existing customer, we expanded as they plan to leverage fed ramp to move to the cloud while purchasing document understanding to drive efficiencies throughout their organization.
Moving on to our partner ecosystem. Partners continue to be a core pillar of our go-to-market strategy and GSIs are building long-term differentiated businesses with us. During the quarter, we had the great partner supported expansion with WEC Energy Group, with consolidating their automation efforts onto our end-to-end platform with Accenture's continued strategic support, they are now planning to leverage our AI-enabled capabilities, including document understanding, aimed at enhancing customer care and agent productivity and driving additional operational efficiencies and insights. Partners are also driving new logo wins, including VHI Group, the largest private health insurer in Ireland.
With the help of EY, we develop a plan to drive long-term digital transformation across their organization. They are in the process of leveraging document understanding to automate elements of their claims journey and core automation to drive the digitalization across the organization, strategic partnerships are an important element of our strategy, and we continue to strengthen our relationship with SAP, which provides us with access to large transformation budgets, new buying centers and the SAP enterprise sales machine.
During the quarter, we saw continued success, including an expansion within Italian eyewear conglomerate, who will be leveraging our platform capabilities to support their migration to SAP S/4HANA. They are also in the process of expanding their usage of Document Understanding to optimize invoice and payments processing.
From a technical partnership perspective, just last week, we announced our expanded partnership with Microsoft, launching a powerful integration with Copilot for Microsoft 365. This integration enables joint customers to automate end-to-end business processes and enhance the end user experience with UiPath. Our focus on innovation is consistently recognized by third-party research analysts. And over the last several months, we received multiple industry awards.
This has included a recognition in Everest Group's intelligent Document Processing products, Peak Matrix assessment 2024 where we were named a leader for the second year in a row being recognized for our vision capabilities and market impact. Our leadership position in is driving demand across our customer base.
For example, [indiscernible] Technologies, customers since 2018 expanded to Communications Mining and Document Understanding in the quarter as they look to automate invoice processing, quality control document, shipping document maintenance records. Our continuous discovery capabilities are also fueling our momentum, and we were recently recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for process mining platform research report. Customers recognize that transformational outcomes they can achieve when they combine our discovery capabilities with our automation products, including a new logo this quarter with one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in North America. The customer had been using [indiscernible], but realized they needed a tool that not only identifies bottlenecks, but also give them the ability to take action. Our outcome-focused messaging and full platform of capabilities resonated with the customer, resulting in competitive displacement. We see an opportunity to share our experience and passion for fostering the next generation of innovative technology solutions, and this includes our recent investment in the company owned by leading AI scientists and researchers, their vision is to reach 4 artificial general intelligence, as they commercially deploy foundational action models.
In addition to our investment, we are collaborating with them on a commercial partnership. We believe what each company is building goes beyond the capabilities of LLMs and will be helpful as we drive a new era of agentic process automation where AI agents collaborate with workers dynamically to reinvent business processes. Personally, I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional founding team on their journey.
Before I turn it over to Ashim, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Ragu Malani, our new appointed Chief Technology Officer. Raghu comes to us with a wealth of experience in fostering and guiding forward thinking, collaborative and customer-focused engineering teams. We are incredibly excited to have him on board and we are confident that his expertise will further elevate our team while delivering best-in-class innovative solutions to our customers.
I am proud of the advancements we have made over the last year including the great talent we've added to our P&E team, and it gives me great confidence in their ability to drive our long-term product strategy while I am transitioning back to the CEO role. As I said several times, we are not satisfied with our results and outlook. As the founder of UiPath, I am energized to step back into the CEO role improve execution and refocus the company on our customers and partners. We remain committed to driving durable growth while maintaining strong profitability. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year I also want to note that since we price and sell in local currency, fluctuations in FX rates impact results.
Turning to the first quarter. ARR totaled $1.508 billion, an increase of 21% driven by net new ARR of $44 million. Excluding the FX headwind of $3 million, net new ARR totaled $47 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 10,800 customers, including new logos like Boomi, Flexjet, Zen business, True Consulting and Calix. As we mentioned over the last several quarters, the vast majority of our customer attrition continues to be in smaller customers, which in aggregate represents an immaterial portion of our overall business.
Moving on to customer metrics. Customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 2,092, while customers with $1 million or more in ARR totaled 288. Our largest customers are also continuing to expand on our platform, and we added a record number of customers with $5 million or more in ARR. Dollar-based gross retention of 98% continues to be best-in-class and our dollar-based net retention rate for the quarter was 118%. The breadth of our platform capabilities continues to drive expansion across our customer base, including Red Bull, who began with core automation and expanded in the quarter, purchasing Test Suite and Document Understanding. They plan to leverage Test Suite to accelerate their S/4HANA migration while utilizing document understanding to automate various use cases across their finance operations and HR departments and Etihad Airways, who expanded to the full platform this quarter as they plan to leverage our platform to support and build more AI automations across commercial and operational functions.
Revenue grew to $335 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Normalizing for the FX headwind of approximately $8 million, revenue grew 18%. Remaining performance obligations increased to $1.101 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Current RPO increased to $683 million.
Turning to expenses. We delivered a first quarter overall gross margin of 86%, and software gross margin was 90%. First quarter operating expenses were $238 million. GAAP operating loss of $49 million included $89 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating income was $50 million, resulting in a first quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 15%. Including the FX headwind of $6 million, non-GAAP operating income was $57 million or a non-GAAP operating margin of 17%. We are pleased with the progress we are making with our AI products such as Autopilot and our new LLMs and we plan to continue to invest in the necessary hosting costs to drive product development and adoption.
The market is evolving rapidly, and we view these investments as key to unlocking growth opportunities in the future. That said, our first half spend is timing related as we feel appropriately budgeted for the overall year. We expect to continue to drive strong cost discipline across the organization. First quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $101 million. As of April 30, we had $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt. We remain committed to our $500 million buyback program as we repurchased 938,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $23.46 from February 1, 2024, through April 30, 2024.
Turning to guidance. I'd like to provide context around our updated outlook for the second quarter and remainder of the fiscal year. As Daniel mentioned, in mid-March, we began seeing increased deal scrutiny and longer sales cycle with our large multiyear deals. Our updated guidance takes into consideration both the macroeconomic environment, our leadership transition and improved operating discipline, which will take time to implement. Because of the complexities of ASC 606, we run and manage our business on ARR, which is most representative of the underlying performance of our business. We are taking a prudent view on the contribution of large multiyear deals.
And as a result, there is an outsized impact to our revenue guidance due to ASC 606 revenue recognition. This outsized revenue impact is the main driver of our reduction in non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow for the remainder of the year. Profitability remains a core pillar of our go-forward strategy, and we will continue to drive efficiencies across our business to generate strong operating margins and meaningful non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $300 million to $305 million, ARR in the range of $1.543 billion to $1.548 billion. Non-GAAP operating income of approximately breakeven. And we expect second quarter basic share count to be approximately 574 million shares. For the fiscal full year 2025, we now expect revenue in the range of $1.405 billion to $1.410 billion, ARR in the range of $1.660 billion to $1.665 billion, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $145 million. And finally, we now expect fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of approximately $300 million. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Just if we could just start off, could you help us better understand kind of what's changed over the last few months? I understand the environment has gotten worse. But when you referenced the issues for those large multiyear deals, is that just scrutiny on deals? Are you seeing more competitive pressures that are causing customers to churn off of certain deployments or completely drop out of the pipeline. Just curious if you could flesh out some of those issues that you're seeing with the large deals. Jake, thank you for the question. Yes. I think that around 6, 7 weeks ago, we were starting to see some pressure, especially on the large multiyear deals. Some of them got shrank. Some of them got postponed. We are not seeing the cause as being from a competitive standpoint. But it's -- I think it's a combination of factors. Macroeconomical environment is variable and customers have a bit more cautious, and they do more scrutiny into the deals.
Another factor for us was a change in the sales comp that happened at the beginning of this fiscal year. And we incentivized a little bit less the multiyear deals, which in retrospect, it was an execution issue. And also, I would say, for us, some late-stage deal execution challenges were identified. We had some -- to give you some examples, some kind of, in one deal, it was procurement error that happened late into the quarter. Another deal, it was a budget reprioritization that we got, were a little bit too late in the quarter. Okay. Helpful. And then for the customers that are renewing at lower rates, how pronounced has that partial churn been in those contracts? And to the extent that you have visibility into it, why are customers turning off those use cases? Is it just digesting what they overbought in prior contracts? Or are there any other issues that play there? I would -- this is Ashim. When you look at our churn rates, actually, when you look at it as a percentage of our renewable base, we've said this historically, they're relatively constant, right? So I don't look at churn as something that is having an outsized impact versus our expectations. Of course, we always want to work harder to drive those numbers to be -- to have better benefits, so to speak, or have more productivity year-over-year with respect to those down-sells, but it is not actually a driver. So we don't see customers turning off use cases, so to speak, to be [indiscernible]. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. This is Arti Vula for Mark Murphy. First question is, I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks, if I understood correctly, a shift towards sales motion that's more verticalized. I'd love to hear why you think that's like the right approach and why now and what the timeline is towards kind of making that happen. Yes. So we announced our strategy to verticalize our approach in go-to-market for quite some time, Mark. And I think with all the -- that happened in the AI world, it's even a better time today. For instance, we are seeing some of our best return on our investments in go-to-market in health care, in financial services, in public sector. And they were driven largely by our investments in AI, particularly in IDP. And it was -- we built more than like 70 dedicated models, industry models that are really helping with our sales effort. Great. And then just some of the headwinds that you described, I know you called out macro versus kind of some internal things together trying to improve on. Is there any way you can help us kind of understand, is it more macro, more than internal challenge to kind of get a qualitative sense of what the proportion is. Yes. It really is a combination of both. It's very hard to quantify and give you an accurate distinction between the two. That said, I think we understand the macroeconomic environment is going to be variable. So we're focused on what we can control. And as Daniel talked about, improving deal execution, driving increased alignment in terms of just across our overall teams and being closer to the customer. We're confident both in our market leadership and our strategy. And if we nail those execution things. Those are the items that are in our control and positions us well for the long term. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. This is Shell McNee on for Raimo. So it seems like part of the issue is around lengthening sales cycles from large multiyear deals, and you discussed the change in sales comp incentivized these large deals less given the current macro, is the solution to break these deals down and land smaller? Or is it to incentivize larger deals more? And do you see a need to change the messaging there? Well, I think that there is a need to rectify some of our -- the sales comp, but we are not going back to the same level as last year. So Shell, I would say that I think we kind of -- we are tuning right now our sales comp. We went a little bit too much in the opposite direction and in regard to incentivizing multiyear deals. So I think I am positive that we can land in a middle ground that will really help us in our growth rates for this year and into next year. Understood. And a quick follow-up. Can you speak to the investment in HAI and how does that play into your overall AI strategy? And any color on the commercial relationship and maybe what's expected there? And then how do you see potential success around developing these models that are capable of reasoning and performing more complex tasks. Is that -- do you expect that to change the automation market? I'm very excited about our investment into HAI company. Actually, I was driving it directly from our side. And I got to know them pretty well. It's a great team of researchers. They have previous experience into relevant build in AI and we have kind of a common goal to advance our agenda of what we call right now, genetic process automation. And to me, it's the ability of a model to get the knowledge of a particular task and combine this knowledge with the ability to execute the task on the top of our platform. I think if we combine our -- the assets that we have, our understanding of processes with their prowess in this dedicated research, we are in a very good position to build one of the most advanced agentic model today. To be clear, what I feel that this model has the most applicability is still in the personal productivity space where people are facing a lot of tasks with varied types of complexity, but the tougher [indiscernible] in itself very diverse. And it's not economically feasible to go to have pay developers to go and automate these tasks. A lot of times, they have a lot of unstructured data, the steps in the tasks are extremely diverse. So this is where, in my opinion, is going to be the sweet spot of this agent process automation, especially in the first phase. If I can say I would think it more like self-driving cars that today, it's more of an assisted technology. And it requires really significantly into getting into autonomous cell driving. It's going to be, in my opinion, the same trajectory for a genetic model. Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. This is Chirag Ved on for Kirk. Following up on the first question that was asked, when you're thinking about large customers extending their cycles, are you seeing them stay on the sidelines as they're reevaluating their Gen AI strategies? And how do you see UiPath's positioning within these companies evolve as their AI strategies mature over time? I want to start by saying that the AI and Gen AI is a tailwind for us. And we have invested significantly over the years and in particular, over last year in Gen AI. In June, we are going to launch our first cities of autopilots in GA. And there is a lot of excitement around our customers about using our Autopilot to drive more adoption to reduce the time to value and overall reduce the total cost of ownership. This being said, I think that AI is creating a little bit of confusion with our customers. And they are evaluating what kind of tasks are better suitable to automate the AI, whichs task are better with using our platform. But what I hear from many of our customers. It's actually the combination between Gen AI and automation, it's something that makes a lot of sense to them. We said it before, but it's like the human body, and it's -- AI is the brain and our platform is the arms and the legs. And the combination makes a lot of sense for most of our customers. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Wanted to ask, as far as the deal scrutiny goes, the smaller deal sizes, the postponements, is that broad-based across the business? Or has it been more so in particular industries or regions? Brian, it's broad-based. I don't think -- it's not that we're zoned in on one particular area. So from a multiyear deal perspective, that's broad. When we talk about the macroeconomic environment and the variability, we definitely see a more pronounced impact on the smaller mid-market customers as we've seen and been talking about historically. Okay. And then on the execution issues or the strategic initiatives that were not working as intended here, you mentioned the sales comp dynamic. Are there other notable examples that you've identified you could talk about? And how are you thinking about the time frame over which some of the intended changes may take? Well, I think the sales comp, it's fixable pretty quickly. And we see as having an impact into the second part of the year. There are other initiatives that we are focusing on. For instance, one of the big change that I want to bring to UiPath right now is to come back and become a fanatical customer-centric company.
I think we went to a distance to go and pitch our business to C-level, which is actually great. But the reality is that we have to increase our adoption by taking care of our traditional line of business customers within the CIO suite, which I think, will benefit a lot more for a new reverted customer-centric approach. Other things that work I think where segmentation was really working, and we feel positive about it.
We have a lot to do in the partnership side of the business. We have also created some of our global structures that, in some ways, I think, are slowing down our decision-making process. So I'm considering changes into and to bring some of our global teams into the regions. But overall, we have a strong foundation, both in product and go-to-market. And I am pretty bullish on what we can execute into this year and into subsequent years. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. It's Mike Richards on for Matt. Maybe Daniel, going off your last answer there, maybe you could talk more to kind of what broader strategy changes you're going to make coming back into your role as CEO? And are you going to be stepping more away from the product side, especially with bringing in Raghu, would just love some more color on that. Yes. Thank you, Mike I'm actually quite happy to be back in the CEO role. I had time in doing the product and engineering for the past year or so to reflect on what I am doing best, how can I have the biggest impact? And I think that right now, I would like to bring more together the big functional teams in UiPath. I think when I say customer centricity, I don't mean only go to market. I mean, product go-to-market marketing and even HR and finance because we -- for instance, I don't think we pitch enough to our customers how well our internal automation program is, and it spends multiple divisions in UiPath. And also, I have -- there is something that is more maybe on the intangible side that I want to bring back in this company. And it's more on the joy of working together.
I have a feeling that we've become maybe a little bit having the mentality of too big of a company, and we've become a bit [indiscernible]. So I want to bring back the ethos forward of how we won in the business, how we grew our business. And it was when all our functions collaborated really well. Everyone in this company was willing to help, we communicate to each other. It was more -- I see more fluidity. So this is another important change that I want to drive. Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. This is Conor Castro for Terry. I just wanted to start, one, Daniel, you talked about the key pillar of go-to-market strategy being to partners kind of want to dig into how are you working with your partners to, I guess, promote solid execution through a continued shift in the go-to-market strategy, especially some of the bigger ones you mentioned SAP, Microsoft, Deloitte, just kind of curious on what's kind of driving the partnership ecosystem. Yes. I think that we have emphasized in the past, our focus on going with large GSIs. Accenture is, as you name it, is one of our biggest partner, and we continue to drive to deal with them. We have also named into into our earnings transcripts and they help us lending sizable deals. Our partnership, I'm particularly bullish on our partnership with SAP. We are starting to see signs of improved pipe. And also, we have quite a good relationship between our leadership teams. And I'm seeing a positive impact especially into next year from our SAP relationship. I would also talk a little bit about the Microsoft partnership and the recently announced cooperation with Microsoft CoPilot, I think it's worth mentioning. It's -- and to my previous point about AI and automation interacting and delivering together value to the customer. This is actually a great example where the copilot can provide the necessary context to the automation that is taking the action. And in the recent build [indiscernible] show of Microsoft, both Sacha and Scott [indiscernible] mentioned us in their keynote just to point out how important our relationship is to Microsoft and of course, to us. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up, $300 million in free cash flow, guide for the year. Balance sheet remains pretty healthy. Just kind of curious about the continued focus on capital allocation and what the strategy might be there. I know you're still buying back shares. Curious on the appetite to continue doing that and also maybe some M&A? Just kind of curious on how you're thinking about the cash balance, free cash flow for the year. Yes. Look, I think that we're very happy with the free cash flow generation that we're able to provide here. We're committed to driving -- continuing to drive efficiency within the company. Like you mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet, which gives us a lot of optionality. And so I think we're going to be opportunistic and do what's in the best interest of the company. And that's a discussion that we have every day and every week, and we'll just continue to have those discussions and make decisions as they become opportunistic for us. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Maybe just a 2-parter for Ashim, if I may. The free cash flow guide is down by less than the operating income guide. First part is just what's driving the difference? Any color there is helpful as we're recasting our models? And then just bigger picture, how you think about the trade-offs between shifting more towards margin if this more challenged environment remains more persistent versus investing into adjacent product opportunities given tangential interest and AI in other areas that you're closely associated with, which could help catalyze growth. Great questions. I'll take the first 1 that you mentioned and address it right off the top. The first is I want to remind everybody that we follow ASC 606 accounting. And so that -- when you have multiyear deals that are impacted, that has a more or an outsized impact to revenue. And you can see that even the differential between our revenue growth rate and our ARR growth rate, right? Within our guidance, we're talking about a 14% ARR growth rate, which is significantly better than the revenue growth rate for the reasons that the complexities of 606, both deployment as well as duration impacts our accounting.
So when you impact revenue, that obviously flows through down through operating margin. And conversely, revenue does not have an impact on free cash flow. So our billings are collections. We do see some level of volume pressure, as we've talked about, between the macroeconomic variability as well as the execution items that Daniel highlighted. So that has just a lesser impact when you look at the pure volume equation. And we obviously run a very -- we continue to run with operating discipline, which means free cash flow stays front and center.
With regard to your second question, I would -- I'd phrase it that we don't believe that there's a fundamental -- there are opposed forces of being able to invest and being able to generate free cash flow. So we stay committed to our long-term margins that we've talked about historically, and yet we're able to invest in the company. We're able to invest within our AI strategy. We're able to invest in great opportunities like [indiscernible] that Daniel talked about. And we're committed to investing in our platform got great response from our customers in terms of the breadth of capabilities that we continue to offer and continue to launch.
So we believe that we can do that while continuing to drive efficiencies across our company. And we believe that there are still efficiencies to be had, particularly in G&A and sales and marketing, and that's a discussion and an operating rhythm that we have with a lot of focus within the company. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. This is Ryan Krieger on for Alex. I just want to circle back to something you said in the prepared remarks. You talked about some deals getting pushed out of the quarter, particularly for large contract customers. Have you started to see some of those deals close in 2Q? And are they also closing smaller than maybe originally anticipated like you saw in 1Q? Or have some of them been lost completely? Are they still in the pipeline? Just any more context around that would be super helpful. Yes. We didn't -- I would say the color that I would give is it's a mixed bag. The only thing is we don't really see losses. When we look at the deals that customers are making decisions on, our win rate continues to be very strong and consistent with what we've seen historically. In terms of closure within the second quarter, yes, there are some deals that are closing, and there are some deals that will continue to -- that we have a path that we're continuing to work through all of which we've contemplated in the guidance numbers that we have in front of us. That being said, overall, we've taken a more prudent view just given the macroeconomic variability and the timing to work through the execution items regarding our overall guidance year. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham and Company. Starting and take the slightly in sensitive question because I know everyone is going to ask it, kind of a 2-parter here. I guess first is can you give us any additional clarity in terms of Rob's departure because it is kind of sudden at least relative to, I think, everyone's expectations. And then, Daniel, how do you view your current term as CEO? Is this a longer-term endeavor or something that maybe little more short term because I know you're excited to kind of just go back and focus on product, but obviously, this is a pivot and change. Well, they are really good questions, Scott. No offense taken really. Look, Rob was leaving for personal reasons. Rob and I are in good terms, and he will continue to be a adviser to the company. We were partners in many of our strategic decisions and in a way that makes it a bit easier for me to step back into day-to-day operational role. And again, I had time to reflect on who I am, what I am [indiscernible] from life and UiPath is such an important part of me that -- it's -- I cannot see myself separated from the company in all fairness. So I -- my intention is to take CEO for for the foreseeable future. I'm fully committed to the job. And if you look back, I was the CEO of this company since its inception for like 17 years, I drove the company from 0 to $2 billion plus through a successful IPO. I'm happy to be fully back in. Excellent. I look forward to those continued conversation with Daniel. And then just from a brief follow-up, Ashim, I appreciate all the 606 commentary and recognize the impact on the model in the short term. because it's certainly unique amongst most of our software companies. But how do we think about margin leverage kind of going forward? Is this really just a function of getting sales back on track maybe over the next couple of quarters and early next year, hopefully, when the environment kind of moderates and improves for you all? Or is this -- I guess there's some opportunities maybe to further adjust your cost structure as you maybe look into late this next year or late this year or next year? Yes. Thanks for the question. The first thing I would say is we have to recognize just given the accounting standard that we follow, I think free cash flow is a great -- is a more appropriate measure of our overall margin for the company, which continues to be very robust at $300 million, right? That continues to be a very high margin rate -- free cash flow margin rate that is there. That being said, I think it comes both ways. We still feel excited about the market opportunity and the customer fit and the customer feedback that we see. It's why we're investing within AI and continuing to invest in our platform. We've had great response from our customers that have expanded like USDA, HCA and we've had great new logos or new customers that we're excited to see start the journey with us. So we feel like growth is something that we -- that will continue to be a leverage lever for us as we go forward.
That being said, like we talked about earlier in the Q&A, I think that there is ample opportunity both within G&A and sales and marketing for us to be able to continue to drive efficiencies and we do that smartly. We don't feel like we have to make abrupt decisions. And we're thoughtful about the strategic -- the overall strategic areas that we're investing in. So I think we can both invest in the company while continuing to drive margins, while the environment continues to moderate, as you mentioned. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Great. Maybe just one for Ashim. It looks like the ARR guide for the year is coming down by about 5 points. And it sounds like you're baking in some extra conservatism, but is there any way to unpack the impact from the macro degradation, the execution challenges you've talked about and then the management changes? I think unpacking quantitatively when it's very hard to model distinctly. There's obviously reinforcing factors to all of the items, and it's hard to disaggregate them as I discussed. That being said, I think our commentary earlier really holds. I think that the macroeconomic variability impacts those larger multiyear deals. And I think there's opportunity to offset some of that pressure with the actions that Daniel talked about, which we're committed to correcting on the execution front. So I wouldn't disaggregate it. I think that there is a -- I think that there is a good opportunity where execution can continue to help moderate the impact of the macroeconomic environment, which is what we've assumed in our guidance. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Thank you so much, everyone, for taking the time. And I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over the next few days and going forward. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.","today's earnings press release and financial supplemental materials are posted on the UiPath Investor Relations website, ir.uipath.com . the call includes forward-looking statements about our ability to drive growth and operational efficiency and grow our platform .",0.0

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Daniel. Thank you, Allise. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to take a moment to thank our team for their improved execution and everything they do to make UiPath successful.
We are pleased with our second quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance across all key financial metrics, a testament to our improved execution and the compelling value that our AI-powered automation platform delivers to our customers. We ended the quarter with ARR of $1.551 billion, an increase of 19%, driven by net new ARR of $43 million. Second quarter revenue was $360 million, and we delivered non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $49 million. I'm excited and energized about my first quarter back in the CEO role. I spent much of my time during the last few months traveling to visit customers, partners, prospects and employees.
Customers globally continue to ask for our help leveraging the power of AI and automation to transform their businesses, and it's is becoming more clear to customers that AI is about automation. To quote the CIO of one of our largest customers, ""We went through a series of workshops internally to develop our AI strategy, and the outcome was more automation."" Building an AI-powered automation strategy isn't just about technology, it's about aligning our capabilities with core business challenges to enhance customer experiences and optimize operational efficiency, and we continue to strengthen our position as the platform of choice for capturing the opportunities that AI brings to an enterprise.
On our first quarter earnings call, we discussed our commitment to improving execution and streamlining the organization, driving a deeper strategy around our growth products, continuing to enhance our relationships with meaningful partners and becoming a more customer-centric organization. I am encouraged with the progress we are making, and I would like to take a few minutes to talk to each of these initiatives in more detail.
First, as I have gone deeper into the operational side of the business, I am committed to continuing to sharpen our focus on operational rigor while learning into areas where the return on investment is the strongest. As the leader in enterprise automation, we have and we will continue to invest in innovation to support our growth initiatives and best serve our customers. With that in mind, our go-forward priority will be balancing these investments while expanding non-GAAP operating margin and delivering sustainable investments and delivering sustainable non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow.
During the quarter, we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce, streamlining the organization and driving further operational efficiencies while better prioritizing our go-to-market investments and continued focus on innovation. With these strategic actions, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $170 million for full fiscal 2025.
Second, we are focused on driving a deeper strategy around our growth products, and we've begun the process of identifying and prioritizing high potential solutions and use cases and ensuring all of our teams from sales to partners to services and products are focused on a common set of priorities that have largest scalable impacts for our customers. While these changes are in the early stages and will take time to build, these enhancements are already having a positive impact, and I'm particularly excited about the successes we've seen with our IDP solutions.
For example, a Central American financial institution began their automation journey by automating back-office processes across treasury, management, payments and customer service, enabling them to reduce their banking transaction clarifications from 8 days to 1 and migrate over 50% of their physical banking transactions to their online channel. After seeing the substantial benefits from our automation capabilities, they implemented document understanding to digitally onboard over 500,000 clients per year and are now piloting IDP for unstructured document by leveraging our generative classification, extraction and validation capabilities. Additionally, they will be implementing Communication Mining in Salesforce to better understand customer issues and reduce clarifications.
Our Test Suite capabilities are also resonating, enabling customers to accelerate time to value while maintaining the stability and reliability of processes and applications in production. During the quarter, we closed our largest Test Suite deal ever with one of the world's largest technology companies.  With the help of UiPath team, they will be implementing our solution to automate testing for their CPQ process in Salesforce and several other processes, including ordering, billing allocation, incentive compensation and forecasting with an expected cost saving of approximately $23 million a year.
Third, partners are a cornerstone of our go-to-market strategy, enabling us to scale our market reach and elevating our customer success initiatives, and I'm excited about our continued progress with SAP, including an expansion deal with an Australian multinational corporation and customer since 2021, who originally used UiPath Test Suite to support their SAP S/4HANA migration. After successfully completing their migration, they expanded in the quarter and are working with UiPath team to establish an automation program globally encompassing core automation, testing and AI. Our SAP partnership is also helping us secure new logos like Gold Peak Technology Group will be automating their order input processes to extract and input data into SAP, eliminating manual inputs and avoiding human errors.
During the quarter, we also expanded our relationship with Deloitte, integrating our capabilities into Deloitte's Ascend platform to transform SAP project delivery and help companies accelerate and refine the execution of business transformation. For this program, automations are available across various project phases and SAP functional areas, facilitating an effective and efficient deployment process, fostering an automation-first project delivery and driving faster value for Deloitte's global customers.
And finally, our success is deeply rooted in our ability to serve our customers, making a customer-centric mindset more crucial than ever. We understand the importance of successful implementation, and the entire company is focused on ensuring our customers achieve it. This includes taking steps to improve alignment and communication between our teams and our customers through deeper account level reviews, ensuring the appropriate connections happen across all customer stakeholders.
Turning to product highlights from the quarter. In our July release, we launched a series of product innovations that deeply infuse GenAI into our automation platform. This included new specialized LLMs for IDP, GenAI activities and the launch of Autopilot for Developers and Testers. Since launching Autopilot, we've seen great early adoption and positive feedback from customers.
A great example is a multinational digital communications company, an early adopter of Autopilot for Testers. The company's generative AI testing road map centers our -- on leveraging our LLM capabilities throughout the entire testing life cycle from creating user stories to generating test cases and to reporting. With the power of Autopilot, they believe they will be able to consolidate the tools using their testing framework and reduce manual testing by up to 50%. And we are excited for the next phase of Autopilot, Autopilot for Everyone, which we expect to launch into general availability this fall. 
Over the past few months, we've been working closely with a few customers in private preview, and we consistently hear that Autopilot for Everyone is not only giving better responses than other LLM-based chat solutions but is also more valuable because it provides the ability to immediately automate an action. To give you an idea of how Autopilot for Everyone is different from other GenAI chat solutions, we'd like to share a quick demo of a real Autopilot use case that we have been working to develop with a U.S.-based biotech company.
If you are not on the webcast, please go to our Investor Relations website for the demo link.
[Presentation] What differentiates us in the market is our end-to-end automation platform, and the demo you just saw is a great example of an experience that only our platform is able to deliver in a unified experience. To be more specific, we are the only platform that can bring together business documents and data, execute UI and API-based automations across systems and utilize a mix of specialized AI and generative AI grounded in organizational data and process information. These capabilities enable users to take real action on enterprise-grade platform that is secure and governed.
There are a few things I find more satisfying than seeing customers leverage our automation platform to flourish and succeed. Their stories are inspiring. For example, Health Service Executive, a customer since 2020, with automations across their HR, finance and community care departments, they have processed over 6 million transactions, saving over 700,000 hours and EUR 28 million today. Driven by the quick time to value and tangible ROI they were able to achieve, HSE expanded in the quarter to urgently extend these automated solutions across their hospital waitlist. Partnering with Deloitte, they are in the process of accelerating the deployment of this solution to an additional 20 hospitals before the end of 2024.
These stories along with the conversations I had with customers, partners and our product team all directly influence how I think about the strategic direction of our business. And I have never been more enthusiastic about where we stand from a product perspective.
As a market leader, it's critical that we continue to innovate to further differentiate our product and I am excited by the next evolution of our platform, UiPath Process Orchestration, which we launched into private preview in June. While legacy business process management vendors typically start with the top-down approach that is often disconnected from how work really gets done, our approach differentiates by allowing organizations to build a unified data-driven bottom-up view. This enables customers to discover, automate, optimize and monitor business processes from start to finish, providing complete visibility into how work is executed by people, automations and in systems.
We believe that process orchestration is the key ingredient for the future of agentic process automation. We are really excited about the progress we are making on this vision and our overall product road map, and we invite you to join us in person to hear more about these product innovations at our user conference, FORWARD, in Las Vegas next month. We hope to see many of you there.
Finally, I wanted to take a moment to thank Ashim. Since joining UiPath in 2018, he has played an instrumental role in transforming our company with his extensive financial and operational capabilities. Over the last several months, it has also been a driving force behind our efforts to refocus the company on its core strengths, improve our operational rigor and reestablish a customer-centric foundation to support our growth initiatives. While Ashim will continue to oversee his traditional CFO responsibilities, I am pleased to share that he will now take on an expanded role as Chief Operating Officer where he will work with me to maximize financial and operating efficiencies across the organization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ashim. Thank you, Daniel, and good afternoon, everyone. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be discussing results on a non-GAAP basis, and all growth rates are year-over-year. Turning to the second quarter, ARR totaled $1.551 billion, an increase of 19% driven by net new ARR of $43 million. Our cloud-first approach is driving adoption across our customer base, and we ended the quarter with more than $850 million in cloud ARR, which includes both hybrid and SaaS, an increase of more than 65%.
A great example is Ontario Power Generation, a customer since 2018, who expanded in the quarter as they begin to migrate to the cloud. They are also planning to expand to additional departments across the organization while incorporating Document Understanding and Communications Mining into their program. We ended the quarter with approximately 10,810 customers, including new logos like [ EXIM ], BenAssist, Moss & Associates and Piedmont Healthcare. 
Moving on to customer metrics. Customers with $100,000 or more in ARR increased to 2,163 while customers with $1 million or more in ARR increased to 293. Dollar-based gross retention of 97% continues to be best in class, and our dollar-based net retention rate for the quarter was 115%. Expansions are driven by the quick time to value and the broad applicability of our automation platform. A great example is AGS Health, a customer since 2021 that currently uses UiPath to automate their claims tracking, eligibility verification and payment posting processes.
In a competitive win, they expanded their usage of Document Understanding, highlighting our unique AI capabilities such as our AI trust layer and human-in-the-loop model training as competitive advantages, scaling from 6 million documents to over 20 million documents processed and saw a 95% accuracy improvement. With support from their CFO and CTO, they will be adopting Document Understanding across their payer and provider departments for medical record patient indexing. 
Turning back to our results. Revenue grew to $316 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations increased to $1.081 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Current RPO increased to $686 million.
Turning to expenses. We delivered a second quarter overall gross margin of 83% driven by continued adoption of our cloud products, and software gross margin was 87%. For the full fiscal year 2025, we continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 85%. Second quarter operating expenses were $257 million. GAAP operating loss of $103 million included $94 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating income was $6 million, resulting in a second quarter non-GAAP operating margin of 2%.
Second quarter non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $49 million. As of July 31, we had $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt. Our strong balance sheet, combined with our free cash flow generation, has enabled us to return capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way through our share repurchase program.
During the quarter, we repurchased 16.3 million shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $12.05 from May 1, 2024, through July 31, 2024. Since July 31, under a 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased an additional 10.7 million shares at an average price of $11.67 through August 30, 2024. And as you may have seen in today's earnings press release, our Board of Directors has approved a $500 million expansion of our share repurchase program, underscoring our confidence in the business, our conviction in the long-term opportunities ahead and our commitment to delivering shareholder value.
Moving on to guidance. We are pleased with the progress and improved execution that we delivered in the quarter. At the same time, we are taking a prudent approach to guidance, which assumes the global macroeconomic environment continues to be variable. As Daniel mentioned, during the quarter, we took a number of actions to drive operational efficiencies and streamline the business. And as a result, we are raising our non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year 2025.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $345 million to $350 million, ARR in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.605 billion, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $27 million, and we expect third quarter basic share count to be approximately 552 million shares.  For the fiscal full year 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $1.420 billion to $1.425 billion, ARR in the range of $1.665 billion to $1.670 billion, non-GAAP operating income of approximately $170 million. And finally, we now expect fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of approximately $325 million.
Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you during the quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator, please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question today is coming from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Congrats on a good quarter. My first question was like, if you think about the changes that you wanted to make in terms of selling more on a departmental level, going back a little bit to your roots, Daniel, you talked about it last quarter. What progress have you seen there? And like what are you seeing in the numbers? Is that showing in the numbers already? Is that showing up in pipeline? Talk us through a little bit about the progress you're seeing there. Well, I want to be very specific that we want to address both C-level suite type of selling with departmental level. And look, it's still early to comment about the progress, but we've made quite a few organizational changes. We have appointed a new leader in North America that I think he was with the company previously, and he can definitely understand our land and expand business while he's very versed into talking to executives.
We've done quite a few changes on the central organizational level. We regionalized some of our functions, and we made clear to the entire company that customer centricity is going to be the core principle to our business. Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, Ashim, like how do we -- like congrats on the expanded role. Like with a lot of other organizations, I mean, with so much to do, you're growing at a high scale, at a healthy clip. Do you think that that's kind of a permanent thing for you? Or should we think about this more as a temporary solution? Look, I think Daniel looks at it as giving me long-term goals for the company. We don't treat -- but anything could change, Raimo, from that perspective, as Daniel always will evaluate the organization. My mandate and my goals that Daniel has given is really make sure that our enabling functions really become in service of the customer and over the field and to drive connectivity across our organization, which we talked about as something that we needed to improve on and as well as continue to drive the operational efficiency and streamline the organization and continue to drive and streamline organizational processes, et cetera.
I'm excited about the opportunity just to continue to work with broader sets of teams. And we look at this as an entire leadership team that is really focused on the goals that have been laid out on, and that's really what we're focused on today. Next question is coming from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Nice to see the stability in the operating results this quarter. Daniel, we've been noticing the term agentic is suddenly becoming very popular. Salesforce came out with its Agentforce branding recently. And part of the notion is that agents are going to have independence and autonomy. And I'm wondering how you might think about the line of demarcation.
Like if we think of a bot and it's following predefined workload -- workflows, excuse me, it feels like predefined logic. You need humans to set up the models and all that. And then if you think about an agent, it's acting independently. They can adapt, right, maybe sometimes without instructions. How are you thinking about that line of demarcation because I think it might be at the root of some of the customer confusion on where RPA might fit into the AI landscape? And then I have a quick follow-up. Yes. That's a great question, Mark. We really think of a agentic process automation as an evolution of robotic process automation. I -- actually, we started to socialize the agentic process automation term during our tour event in London, in Paris at the beginning of the summer. And we introduced the concept of robots and agents working together. And to me, an AI agent is basically a robot, if you want, that has some new skills. And I think there will be multiple type of agents.
For instance, there will be agents that are capable of extracting information from long and complex documents. And users, human users will be capable of interacting with these agents asking questions. And in turn, they can ask the agents to perform actions for them. There will be agents that can make more intelligent decisions based on data, and they can route a process in a more dynamic way. As you can -- as you know, for sure, robotic means that the series, the steps in a process are stitched together in a fixed way. And agentic workflow might have dynamic routine as part of the process.
I want to iterate where is really our strength here. And it is in combining actually robotic automation with agentic automation as part of our Process Orchestration platform because I think the key differentiator in customers deploying agents will be in how well they are integrated within the business platform and how well we can orchestrate between robots, agents and humans. And I think we are uniquely positioned to bring the power of LLM-based agents into our platform and offer this level of orchestration. Okay. That's a great explanation. And Ashim, I wanted to ask you, do you see any line of sight to a point in time where some of the AI confusion might dissipate and maybe begin to turn into kind of a full-blown AI tailwind for UiPath? Like in other words, customers might reeducate and understand and how to move jointly with AI and automation because I guess I'm curious. Could we look on this period of softer ARR growth? Could we look back on it and maybe say that it was just -- there was a bit of a temporary period of confusion before customers kind of figured it out? Look, I want to be careful about giving any type of long-term guidance implied in that, Mark. At the same time, what I can say is we're investing in the platform, and we'll continue to invest in the platform and our AI capabilities because we see it as a meaningful opportunity to drive value and differentiation with customers, which, in our minds, reflects on the conviction that we have in the company.
In the script and other areas, Daniel has already talked about customer conversations are already becoming clearer for us, right? Like people are seeing the linkages between AI and automation. So we're already seeing positive response and more clarity from our customers. How the AI narrative translates in the broader market, confusion moving in and out because of broader factors and as that area evolves, I think we're all going to -- we all take it day by day and quarter by quarter. But long term, we feel very good about what AI is bringing, and we're investing because we do believe it has a meaningful ROI and reinforces the durability of our growth rate. Next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Congrats, Ashim, on the expanded role. My first question, just on demand. Is it -- macro variability has been a pretty consistent message in how you've described how enterprises are behaving now for several quarters. We understand things deteriorated last quarter, I guess, late March into April. Can you just comment on what you saw through the balance of 2Q and into August as well? I think we saw things pretty stable, Bryan. We still describe the macroeconomic environment as variable. We've talked about the commercial end or the lower end of the market having a higher degree of impact, and we see that to be -- to remain consistent. And we see that just really broadly across all geographies, et cetera.
I do think that as our execution improves and as we've made -- as we've streamlined different areas, I think we're adopting well to the environment. But I do feel like the environment is stable versus last quarter. And we didn't really see any ups and downs month to month within the quarter. Okay. And then as it relates to restructuring and how we should think about potential yield from that, can you comment on whether that -- the restructuring actions you're taking, does that impact that 20% long-term adjusted operating margin target you had? And is it kind of -- is it going to provide upside there? Or is it more of a means to achieving that? Look, I think that we're going to update our long-term guidance at the appropriate time. What I -- what we do feel in our restructuring efforts that we've taken and that we're going to continue to look at different ways to streamline the organization, we do feel like there's more efficiency to be had there, Bryan. And then we'll update that on our long-term margins as we go. We have always said that we're going to be 20% plus in terms of our long-term margin. So what that plus looks like, that's what we'll update at the appropriate time. Next question is coming from Matthew Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Maybe going off that last question there. I was wondering if you could provide some more details on the restructuring just in terms of like sizing 1and what areas were impacted and then also if you're accounting for any disruption between the restructuring or the general organization changes and guidance. Yes. Maybe let me start with high level overview, and then I'll let Ashim to bring more color. I think, largely, we have restructured our central functions. And we like -- we were looking at more like sales operation, sales enablement functions in -- especially. Also part of restructuring, I can tell you, we -- basically, we look in all areas of the company. And I think we -- our goal is longer term that this restructuring into bringing a great level of efficiency and agility into the company. And then just in terms of disruption, we provided our guidance in the last quarter earnings. I think there's no incremental impact to that, that I would say from a disruption standpoint we would account for at this time. Again, as Daniel said, when it's -- a lot of the streamline -- a lot of the central organizations, they didn't really impact the growth of the company, right, and growth rate of the company. They really were -- there was a larger disconnect between those organizations and the field. So that's one of the reasons why we did not see that disruption or why we don't feel like there is a meaningful disruption that needs to be singled out. Next question is coming from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Daniel, you laid out a number of initiatives across operations, products, partners, customer success. I was wondering, as you sort of look at sort of the near to midterm, where do you see the lowest hanging fruit in terms of getting back to a better growth trajectory? And then I have a follow-up. Look, I think we continue to see, as we said in the last earnings call, it's -- we had to make our teams working well together. This is the -- this is basically -- it was our first goal, to break the silos into the organization and make sure that we align everything in the interest of the customer.
So for example, some of the low-hanging fruit was to put back customer success into the region while keeping some kind of centralized program about it and same with our technical account management. We have simplified some of the [ rule ] nomenclature. And yes, it's -- I think it was a lot about simplification and moving people into the regions. Ashim, anything to comment? No, I think so -- look, I think the first step was improving execution, as Daniel said, and that meant breaking down the silos and really connecting the teams. I do think the investments that we're making that Daniel talked about in terms of agentic, the investments in process orchestration, we gave examples of the test deal that we won in the quarter. Those are all evidence of different parts of our strategy that as we continue to drive and execute, we feel reinforce the durability of our growth. I really appreciate that perspective. And then sort of reason to my follow-up. On the product side of the house, clearly, there's a lot of innovation going on. We have Autopilot GA coming up, Communications Mining, Process Orchestration, Dan, what you highlighted. Historically, we've talked to customers in the past. Some of them have commented that the sort of breadth and depth of the product portfolio was a little overwhelming in terms of where to invest that incremental dollar. Can you sort of talk -- speak to how the pricing packaging side is evolving along with some of the restructuring changes in terms of making the solution more digestible into the enterprise? Yes. We -- I think one of the major initiatives that is actually in progress is to look at our pricing and packaging and come up with maybe even quite a different model that should tie our pricing more to the value that we deliver. I think it's a bit too early to comment on this one.
On the -- also on the platform in itself, we are having some key initiatives. Maybe we talk a little bit about them. But we -- it's called -- internally, we call it like [ Unify ] build type. So we aim to present our platform in a much more consistent way to the developer. So basically, anyone using the platform, we have all the tools better integrated, so they will create an application easier.
For instance, to give you an example. If you want to create like an onboarding application, you can start with building the user interface and then you can connect very easy the user interface with some kind of automations. And then the automations can take advantage of our Communication Mining or Document Understanding or Data Service, and everything will be completely integrated. So it doesn't look like you go to different systems. So I think that will also help customers to understand better our offering. Your next question is coming from Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho Securities. Ashim, congratulations on the expanded role. So going back to the, let's say, new business. You talked about challenging macro environment and even some sort of confusion between this AI and RPA, where to invest. But if we dig into the expansion side of your installed base, what are the opportunities or challenges you're seeing at this point? I think when we look at our expansion, I think the first thing I would just note is like our customers that are between $100,000 and $1 million, they are continuing to expand at 120-plus percent. So really making sure that our customers get to a certain scale, Siti, across our 10,800 customers, that's important. That goes down to what Daniel has reinforced of not just the C level but the grassroots level of adoption and making sure we're connected at that base area.
The second piece is the more people adopt our full platform and features Document Understanding, intelligent document processing. When you look at many of the larger deals in the quarter, they're not core RPA alone, and they haven't been for a while. Those deals have multiple elements of our platform, if not, the entire platform. And continuing to drive that awareness and continue to driving that within our customer base, those are kind of like our 2 biggest areas.
And frankly, the personal productivity side, that is an increasing competitive area. We've always talked about that. That's not the majority of where we want to play. So continue to drive enterprise grade use cases and solutions with our customer, that also continues to be a priority that really bolsters the net dollar expansion rate for us. That's great. And a follow-up to, I think, Mark's question earlier about the agentic automation. It's certainly now increasing competition. There are other vendors now with agent AI coming in, but it's good to see the innovation and the investment you're doing on the product side. But where do you see the sweet spot? Is it more your product is more addressing the installed base that you have? That's where you have the sweet spot. Or do you think you can effectively compete with the new deals against the new set of competitors? Well, I think we have some distinctive advantages. First of all, we have a low code platform that our developers are used to. And they are using our low code platform to build agents as well. A lot of the like new entrants, new start-ups are targeting more like professional developers. We work more with our automation developers, and it's quite a large population. So we aim to give them all the building blocks to build agents. So that's one of our advantage.
Second is these agents are not so useful if you don't pair them with actions. And this is, I think, where we will shine and we have a unique advantage to actually deliver agents that understand data or can make decisions and can call actions. And first of all -- and also think about it's not enough to build one single agent. An enterprise will have maybe hundreds and thousands of agents over time. So it's equally important to orchestrate these agents, manage them, offer them in a secure and governed environment.
And this is actually built in, in our platform. And it's not -- we spent many years to build the scalable orchestration platform. It takes really a long time to have it. And we have it already. We just are taking the best of LLM world, embed it into our platform and deliver easy to our customers. Our next question is coming from Kirk Materne from Evercore. This is Chirag on for Kirk. Congratulations on the quarter. So following up on one of the prior themes that was brought up. How are you finding the right balance between selling the automation platform versus selling core RPA? You're clearly seeing success with large customers and platform adoption. But are you finding that certain customers are just looking for core RPA when they land? And what's your philosophy on approaching those accounts? Well, RPA is a pretty powerful technology. And it can go to really a long distance in addressing customers' automation needs. And if you think of how we build our platform is really going after white spaces around RPA, so RPA naturally evolve into a business automation platform. But our ability to emulate human users is the core principle that is behind our platform.
In a way, this is why if you think today AI fits so naturally -- GenAI fits so naturally into our platform because GenAI, it's an imitative of how human mind works type of technology. And that's -- again, that's -- even since our IPO, we made it clear. Our platform emulates human users. That's the core tenet of what we are building. So in this sense, it's a natural extension from RPA to broader automation to an AI-powered automation platform. Next question is coming from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. This is Dominique Manansala on for Terry. So just looking at the recently achieved FedRAMP authorization, could you provide more details on your progress and customer interest in the pipeline you've seen in the public sector so far? And are there any specific government agencies or verticals where you see the greatest potential for automation adoption? Well, I think public sector is one of the fastest growth industry for us. I'm very happy having achieved the FedRAMP authorization. I think this is going to accelerate our business in public sector. We also are looking forward to take the lessons learned while building FedRAMP into other countries and territories and power more of our public sector business. So I think long term, we are seeing an increase of the percentage of revenue in our company coming from the public sector for sure. Next question is coming from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. We've touched on the transition a bit and the slight shift in priorities with Daniel stepping back into the CEO role. Maybe -- I'm curious just to go back and if you could provide us with an update on how those efforts are progressing. And in particular, we're looking at the customer metric and noticed an uptick there for the first time in a couple of quarters. And so I'm wondering if that's at all reflective of some of the changes in focus you're implementing. Any commentary on just new customer additions and what you're seeing there is also helpful. Look, I think -- like we said, I think we feel like a better connected team and a more streamlined team will execute better. And I think that should reflect more and more across every part of our core metrics and our core financial results. What I'd still say, Michael, is I don't think our philosophy has changed. We're still looking after quality of new logos versus quantity. I think the uptick, it's a good quarter that we have there. But I don't look at that as a change in philosophy or strategy. I just think about it as better execution overall, and it's an area that we'll continue to monitor.
We still feel like the land and expand is an important part of who we are, but that expansion motion also continues to be a primary driver. And frankly, when we're talking into and inspecting our pipeline, looking into our different regions and territories, we ask about both new customers as well as expansions. And we're really pleased with the response that our teams right now are giving us and the execution levels of this quarter that we're starting to see. Next question is coming from Scott Berg from Needham & Company. I'll just go with one in the essence of time here. Ashim, one of the things you mentioned was cloud revenues up 65% year-over-year to I think it was just over $850 million. Help us understand, I guess, what deal composition looks like. That's a big number. It's up a lot. I know you're kind of pushing that platform or some of those modules and use cases more. But as we think about the business maybe for the balance of the year, how much of the balance is, I guess, squared on those types of use cases in modules versus maybe what you've seen over the last year or 2? I think we've seen a consistent growth rate of like strong and elevated growth rate on our cloud-enabled customers and just our cloud in general. One of it is just overall awareness that continues to drive across our customer base but more so their own readiness to move to the cloud and start adopting those cloud products. When you look at things like communications mining, when you look at things like document understanding, I think the value to move to be a part of the cloud continues to accrete, and we really like that.
At the same time, like we've always said, we want to be customer centric in this regard and make sure customers have the flexible choice. And that's really what we're providing and allowing them to move to their own journeys. I do think as our platform expands, I think -- and we have a cloud-first mindset in our releases, et cetera. I think that continues to drive more and more value for -- that customers can derive for the cloud itself. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Thank you so much, everyone, for your questions. I would like to remind you that our user conference event is coming in just 6 weeks. I would like to see many of you in Vegas, and I'm looking forward to meeting also many of you over this quarter.
