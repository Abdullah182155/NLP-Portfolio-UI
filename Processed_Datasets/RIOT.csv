[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Philip McPherson, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Thank you, Phil. You may begin. Thank you, Devine. Good morning, and welcome to Riot Platforms First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Phil McPherson, and joining me on today's call are Jason Les, CEO; Colin Yee, CFO; and Jason Chung, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy. On the Riot Investor Relations website, you can find our first quarter 2024 earnings press release and earnings presentation, which are intended to supplement today's prepared remarks and which include a discussion of certain non-GAAP items.
Non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding potential future events. These statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed in today's earnings press release and comments and responses made during today's call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q included for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which will be filed today after market close and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Riot filed our first quarter 2024 press release and earnings presentation this morning, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of Riot's website. Riot's primary strategic focus has been on developing a leading vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company, built on the 3 key pillars of developing and owning operations of significant scale, being a low-cost producer of Bitcoin and building a balance sheet of strength.
By focusing on a vertically integrated strategy, we are best able to build these pillars. Over the past 3 years, we have been focused on developing this strategy at scale. This began with the acquisition of our Rockdale facility, its development and operations teams and low-cost fixed power contracts. The strategy continued with the acquisition of ESS Metron and the introduction of our engineering segment, which helps control the key supply bottleneck for electrical equipment and building out Bitcoin mining infrastructure.
And finally, the development of our Corsicana facility has broadened our portfolio of access to power capacity and purpose-built Bitcoin mining facilities. The benefits of this strategy are on display today. And as a result, we see other miners in the space moving towards a similar strategy.
Since Riot has developed this strategy most fully and at scale, we are able to build out facilities like Corsicana further, while others who have not already ordered key pieces of electrical equipment, based 18-plus months of supply chain constraints. The energization of Corsicana this month means that Riot has a clear, fully funded growth plan. This landmark achievement is the result of our team's dedication to our long-term strategy.
The first phase of this facility puts us well on track to increase our self-mining hash rate to 31 EH/s by the end of 2024. The Corsicana facility utilizes immersion cooling for all of its buildings, a technology in which Riot is the industry leader in deploying at scale. We are very excited about the incredible pipeline for growth the Corsicana facility provides for the next several years, and we look forward to further executing on this plan.
Through owning and operating our own sites and an unmatched portfolio of 345 megawatts of fixed-price long-term power agreements, we have the unique ability to execute on our power strategy, which demonstrates the benefits of Bitcoin mining for grid stability and significantly drives down our cost of power. Power is the primary variable input for Bitcoin mining, and that is why we have built our reputation as a leader in this key part of our business.
Making large acquisitions, developing pipelines for growth and maintaining fixed price power contracts at scale requires a strong financial and liquidity position. Our unmatched balance sheet strength makes all of this possible and is responsible for their success. With this strong position, we are funding our near and intermediate-term growth plans to expand Corsicana and increase our hash rate through purchasing leading-edge miners on a long-term fixed price basis for MicroBT.
In conclusion, we remain focused on the growth and enhancement of our self-mining business. In 2023, we terminated 2 remaining legacy hosting contracts at the Rockdale facility because of both customers' failure to perform under those agreements. As a result of the reduction in hosting revenue, we have eliminated the data center hosting business as a separate reporting segment starting in the first quarter of 2024 and our consolidating results into the Bitcoin mining business segment. Riot's focus is maximizing Bitcoin mining results, and our strategy is enabling us to execute on this at an unprecedented scale.
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Colin Yee, CFO of Riot Platforms. Thank you, Jason. I'm excited to present Riot's financial results for the first quarter of 2024, during which Riot achieved a number of key milestones. For ease of reference, Slide 5 presents a snapshot of key metrics for the first quarter of 2024. But let's go over some highlights on the following pages.
We own and operate one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in North America. And during this past quarter, we continue to deploy miners in Rockdale. We have also pushed ahead with development activities at our new Corsicana facility, which has since been energized and operations have begun.
At the end of the first quarter of 2024, our Bitcoin mining business segment had a total deployed hash rate of 12.4 EH/s, which represents an 18% increase year-over-year. And as Jason previously mentioned, we anticipate achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 31 EH/s by the end of 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we mined 1,364 Bitcoin, which represents a decrease of 36% from the 2,115 Bitcoin we mined during the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to the significant increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023.
However, with the significant increase in growth in our hash rate capacity expected by the end of this year, we anticipate producing more Bitcoin per day by the end of the year than we did in the first quarter of 2024, even in spite of the recent halving that occurred a few weeks ago on April 20, 2024.
Riot ended the first quarter of 2024 was 8,490 Bitcoin, up significantly relative to the 794 Bitcoin that we held at the end of the first quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, Riot reported total revenue of $79.3 million as compared to $73.2 million for the first quarter of 2023, an 18% increase year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by a 131% increase in average Bitcoin prices year-over-year, offset by lower Bitcoin production, which decreased 36% year-over-year, again, due primarily to the significant increase in Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023.
In footnote #1, you should note that power curtailment credits received totaled approximately $5.1 million for the quarter as compared to $3.1 million during the first quarter of 2023. And this equates to approximately 98 Bitcoin as computed by using average daily closing Bitcoin prices on a monthly basis. If these power credits received were applied to our total cost of revenues, our non-GAAP gross profit margin would have equaled $37.3 million or a 47% margin.
Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $245.7 million as compared to the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $81.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. Based on FASB's final standard on crypto assets issued in December 2023, under which Riot now recognizes its Bitcoin held at fair value and with changes in fair value now recognized in income. Riot elected to early adopt this guidance in 2023.
Net income for the quarter was $211.8 million or $0.82 per share compared to net income of $18.5 million or $0.11 per share for the same period in 2023. As a reminder, our net income for the quarter included a change in the fair value of Bitcoin equal to $234.1 million, noncash stock-based compensation expense of $32 million and depreciation and amortization of $32.3 million.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we adjusted our depreciation schedule for mining hardware from a 2-year to a 3-year schedule based on our evaluation of market practice and our own operational history. In 2023, Riot terminated its 2 legacy data center hosting agreements. During the first quarter of 2024, revenue from the final data center hosting agreement was no longer material from both revenue and profit. And so commencing this quarter, we will no longer report data center hosting as a separate reportable segment. We also have no plans to offer data center hosting services to new customers.
For the first quarter of 2024, Bitcoin mining revenue totaled $74.6 million, which included $32 million in hosting revenue, an increase of $26.6 million year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to higher Bitcoin prices in the first quarter of 2024, which averaged $52,343 compared to $22,706 in the first quarter of 2023. However, this increase is partially offset by a decrease in Bitcoin mined in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, again, due to the significant increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty.
Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue primarily consists of direct production costs, including electricity, labor and insurance and excludes depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin Mining revenue in excess of Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue for the quarter was $33.5 million, which is a margin of 45% as compared to $26.1 million or a margin of 54% from the first quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenues from the expansion of Bitcoin mining capacity at our Rockdale facility.
If power credits were directly allocated to Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue, Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue would have decreased by $5.1 million, increasing our Bitcoin Mining margin to $38.6 million or 52% on a non-GAAP basis. Bitcoin Mining costs also included $4.5 million of power cost for the remaining hosting contracts.
Slide 9 breaks down Riot's cost to mine. The first quarter of 2024 for Riot had changes to our reporting segments. In 2023, Riot terminated the 2 remaining agreements under the legacy data center hosting business due to the failure of both customers to meeting their obligations under the agreements. As such, costs that had previously been captured and reported in the data center hosting segment have been absorbed by our self mining operations and presented within the Bitcoin mining segment in our first quarter 2024 financial statements.
Direct cost of mine in the first quarter of 2024 was $23,034 per Bitcoin, of which power costs were $16,764 or 73% of the total. Other costs of $6,270 represents the remaining 27%. The increase in the global network hash rate and accompanying increase in network difficulty was the primary driver behind an increase in Riot's average direct cost to mine Bitcoin.
Other costs include direct labor, miner insurance, miner and miner related equipment repairs, land lease and related property taxes, network costs and other utility expenses. We have already ordered new MicroBT machines to be deployed at our Rockdale facility, of which deployment will begin in the second quarter of 2024. And as additional hash rate is deployed and operational uptimes increased, we expect increased production of Bitcoin at the Rockdale facility. So as production increases, these fixed costs will be spread across the greater number of Bitcoin produced, thereby lowering our cost of mine of each Bitcoin.
Riot's engineering business carried on through Riot's wholly owned subsidiary of ESS Metron, reported revenue of $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $16.1 million for the same 3-month period in 2023. The decrease of $11.4 million was primarily attributable to global supply chain constraints resulting in decreased receipts of materials. This delayed the completion of certain custom products for 2 large projects potentially worth $13.2 million, which ended up not being delivered in the quarter, and therefore, we were not able to recognize this revenue.
These supply chain shortages also impacted projects in our backlog due to the lack of manufacturing capacity. However, we anticipate that the supply chain issues currently impacting our engineering results will be resolved towards the end of the third quarter of this year. Engineering gross margin for the quarter was similarly impacted by these issues, resulting in a gross loss of $1.3 million as compared to a gross profit of $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. I will now turn the call back over to Jason Les. Thank you, Colin. Pictured on this slide is an aerial shot of our new Corsicana facility. We purchased the land for this facility in 2022 due to its strategic location next to the Navarro switch where 1 gigawatt of power capacity was available. Over the past 2 years, we have worked to develop this site's support reaching 1 gigawatt in total capacity, beginning with the first phase consisting of 400 megawatts of 100% immersion cooled Bitcoin Mining infrastructure, which spans 4 total buildings.
The 400-megawatt substation for the first phase of Corsicana's development was energized last month and mining operations have already commenced. Construction remains underway to complete the rest of the first phase by the end of 2024, and in 2025, we intend to continue development of this site to eventually reach 1 gigawatt in total capacity, which would cement the Corsicana's facility status as the largest dedicated Bitcoin Mining facility in North America and potentially globally.
Riot's infrastructure pipeline and long-term miner purchase agreement with MicroBT provides us with a clear and direct path to reaching 100 EH/s in self-mining hash rate. Based on our current purchase agreements and development plans, Riot plans to exit 2024 with a total hash rate of 31 EH/s. This includes 2.7 EH/s of growth at our Rockdale facility and 16 EH/s of new growth at our Corsicana facility. Altogether, when fully developed, this would represent a 154% increase in self-funding hash rate over 2024.
Fully developing the Corsicana facility through the remaining 600 megawatts of remaining capacity following the completion of the first phase of development and executing a part of our purchase option of MicroBT M56S miners would allow Riot to reach nearly 60 EH/s in total astray capacity. In other words, Corsicana provides a substantial amount of the infrastructure needed for Riot to utilize its purchase options with MicroBT and reach our 100 EH/s goal. These components give Riot the most directly visible and predictable pipeline for Riot Platforms in the Bitcoin Mining sector.
In order to fully utilize our pipeline of infrastructure, over the past 12 months, we have entered into a series of agreements with MicroBT to a total of 32 EH/s of next-generation miners. The decision to enter these large-scale purchase agreements came after several months of testing various latest generation MicroBT miners in both immersion and air-cooled environments and observing strong operating performance.
As a result of this investment, full deployment of our purchase orders is expected to improve our overall fleet efficiency by 21.3% to 21.8 J/TH. As part of our long-term agreement with MicroBT, we have purchase options for an additional 75 EH/s of miners on terms substantially similar to our original order. This option provides for a fixed price ceiling of $16.50 per TH on next-generation miners in order to support Riot further growing its fleet and improving overall efficiency.
Assuming full exercise of our purchase options and deployment of those miners, our fleet efficiency would improve even further to 19.7 J/TH. Riot prioritizes maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant cash and Bitcoin holdings in order to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. As a result, we can act decisively and continuously scale our business to meet the growing opportunities in the Bitcoin mining space.
Our print growth plans to reach over 40 EH/s in 2025, call for $619 million in capital expenditures, which you can see broken down on this slide. We have sufficient financial resources to fund these growth plans entirely, and we expect to end 2025 with total liquidity exceeding that out of the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Riot's vision is to be the world's leading Bitcoin driven infrastructure platform. The strategy we have been executing on over the past several years has now begun bearing the results, which position us to realize this vision. Through our vertically integrated strategy, we have created an unmatched infrastructure growth pipeline to increase our hash rate by 154% this year to 31 EH/s and to ultimately lead us to our goal of reaching 100 EH/s in total self-mining has rate.
Riot's balance sheet strength underpins our ability to achieve these targets. And as a result, our 2024 and 2025 growth plans are fully funded. We are incredibly excited about what Riot is accomplishing this year, and we look forward to executing on our stated goals on our path to achieving 100 EH/s.
Thank you all for listening to our presentation. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions]
Phil, the floor is now yours for the Q&A session. Thank you, Devine. We'll take our first call from Kevin Dede at H.C. Wainwright. Kevin? It looks like he dropped off. We'll move to the next one. Our next question will come from Greg Lewis of BTIG. Yes. Jason, just watching the strategy unfold in terms of the Bitcoin inventory management. It seems like we've kind of gone through ebbs and flows in terms of funding some operations with Bitcoin. More recently, at least based on the monthly production guidance, it seems like we started holding back and really trying to build that Bitcoin inventory in February and March. I don't think we -- I think maybe we saw a couple of Bitcoin.
Post the halving now, as we look at, I guess, May and beyond, how are you thinking about managing the puts and takes in terms of using Bitcoin that you're generating to kind of offset some costs and then at the same time, trying to build that inventory. Any kind of thoughts around that? Sure. Thanks, Greg. So our strategy is to always maintain a strong balance sheet. I think by now, we've all seen how business played out as a key strength for Riot. This includes both in cash and in Bitcoin. We are here because we're a Bitcoin company. We believe in a long-term value of Bitcoin. So we try to hold as much Bitcoin as possible.
As you noted, at the beginning of this year in January, we stopped selling Bitcoin. In February and March through our monthly updates, we reported we have not sold any Bitcoin. So currently, we are not selling any Bitcoin. However, we are continuing to always monitor our balance sheet in light of what we need from capital expenses and what we need for operational growth.
By maintaining such a strong balance sheet with a cash position that we're reporting today, we have sufficient cash reserves and further access to cash to our ATM program to continue to fund all of our growth plan and our operating expenditures. So it's a decision that we're making on a month-by-month basis of value in the market, evaluating the financing options, evaluating our cost of capital and with the parallel goal of trying to hold as much Bitcoin as possible. Okay. Great. And then just -- my other question was on the engineering business. Realizing that it's not a major driver of the company. Clearly, that's the Bitcoin Mining, but there was kind of a -- I guess there's a 2-part question here in terms of the engineering. With the first being, is there any seasonality that we should be thinking about as we look out over the next, I don't know, 3 to 4 quarters?
And then also, I was kind of curious, clearly, when you bought Metron, there was an opportunity to kind of get involved on the infrastructure equipment side, not realizing maybe that Riot's core function as a miner isn't going to be around AI data centers. Is that business Metron? Is that positioned at all to benefit from kind of this ongoing AI infrastructure wave that seems like it's -- we're in the midst of... Yes. So let me tackle this, starting with the last question, Greg. So first, there is incredible demand for this type of electrical agreement right now. While Riot owned ESS Metron, we are one of the smallest customers. Overall, they have a ton of business and a ton of demand from all these data centers -- AI data centers that are rapidly trying to build out and meet demand for this type of service. So they are really overloaded with business opportunity. And what it's limited on has been manufacturing, warehouse capacity and access to the input parts from the global supply chain.
So they are benefiting quite a bit from this, and we are looking to increase the capacity of this business so they can meet the demand for these data centers and AI data centers, et cetera. But as you stated, our number one purchase -- reason for purchasing the ESS Metron was strategic. One, we noted in our deck here, it has reduced our CapEx expense for purchasing this electrical equipment from them by about $10 million over the 2 years since we've acquired them.
But even more important than that, it has been a critical component of controlling our supply chain while other competitors might have to rely on external parties to procure the electrical equipment and design custom engineering design what they need. We're able to control this in-house. We have visibility in our supply chain. We can move around this. We can make changes. It's been very advantageous to us as we built out both Rockdale and Corsicana.
Then your -- first part of your question, though, was the seasonality results. I think you will see a good amount of seasonality this year. Like we noted, the first quarter results were impacted by these global supply chain issues, which held back 2 big orders from moving forward. So not only could those orders not move forward and be recognized as revenue, they occupy space that stops other jobs from being completed.
So we expect these to be cleared up during the second half of 2024. We have additional warehouse space we procured. They're on top of resolving the supply chain issues. So that will allow these 2 key contracts to move forward. We can recognize those revenue and then we can keep the backlog flowing with the other demand, which is, as you asked about quite full of data center and AI infrastructure. Our next question is from Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright. Mike? First one is really more of a high-level question for me. Just curious how you guys are thinking about the operating environment here with cash prices at all-time lows post halving, the implications for your growth trajectory at Riot and how you expect the M&A landscape to play out as less efficient miners are forced to power down here? Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. Let me answer the first part, and then the other question, I'll turn it over to Jason Chung, our Head of Corporate Development to talk about M&A here. I think the halving is always a tough time for miners. Immediately after this one, it seems not as bad because a huge influx of transaction fees that we saw, right? There were blocks with 30 Bitcoins in transaction fees and they scaled up from there, but that really offset the decrease in the -- from the block reward halving.
But that has subsided and recently, the price has gone down. I think by focusing on being a low-cost producer, Riot is very well positioned for these types of trough periods in Bitcoin Mining economics. Culminating with the summer here, especially with our power strategy, we are able to be very responsive with the price of power, use that to lower our direct cost of mine, and that allows Riot to be a low-cost producer when others have to fall off the network here.
And when those higher-cost producers fall off, as you know, difficulty adjust and then that widens the margin again as we're mining more Bitcoin. So we believe this is the type of environment where Riot's strategic pillars are on full display. Obviously, we're long-term bullish on Bitcoin. I just talked about we're holding Bitcoin because we believe in the upside of the system long term.
But to be -- to reach that long term, to be a leading Bitcoin Mining company, we have to focus on having this low cost of power and maintain a low cost of production through more difficult points in the market.
On the M&A question, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Jason Chung. Thank you, Jason. Mike, thanks for the question. From our perspective, historically, I think deals have really been tendered in the sector by a number of factors. We can look at volatility in the underlying public miner stock volatility and underlying Bitcoin prices, differences in Bitcoin price expectations across buyers and sellers among other factors. And all of these factors have really led to what we've seen as a pretty -- a fairly wide gap between buyer expectations on valuation and seller expectations on valuation historically.
But I think our sense is that, that gap has started to narrow, particularly pre-halving and now that we're post halving, I think that trend will continue. At the same time, we've seen very healthy deal flow pre-halving, and we think that deal so will further increase post-halving. So when you take these 2 factors into consideration together, I think there's a really interesting window of opportunity approaching for deals to be done in the sector.
And on our side, we spent a lot of time building out what we believe is the most sophisticated corporate development team in our space, precisely to address this upcoming window. That's great color. Appreciate that. And going back to the engineering business for just a moment. How should we think about engineering revenues once the supply chain issues are resolved later this year, especially given the growing backlog you guys are experiencing? Should we expect the run rate to go back in line with what we saw last year? Or should we experience more of an elevated level, especially given the growing demand for that business? Mike, I would say you can think about it just following the historical performance for now. I think the main thing that we need to work on to scale this business is increasing the capacity of that engineering segment. That will really be the driver of improved financial performance there. The demand is enormous. That has not been an issue for us. It's really expanding our manufacturing warehouse capacity. So we're working on that, but I wouldn't guide towards expecting a higher increase for that at that time. But it's something I think we could touch on at our next earnings call. Great. We'll take our next call from Darren Aftahi from ROTH MKM. Darren? Two questions, if I may. The machines you're going to replace in Rockdale. I think in the release, you said those are going to start in the second quarter. Could you just kind of speak to the cadence of how those are going to be added? And then secondly, on the hosting capacity, any kind of sense on resolution there, at least what you can publicly say in terms of how you kind of shift some of that to self mining in the future? Yes, Darren. So for the hash rate replacement and growth at Rockdale. This is with the M60 series, latest generation MicroBT miners that we purchased. We're receiving those this month. We've been preparing to deploy those miners. I would say we can probably expect this to begin at the end of May, continued through June and July. I think the bulk of the deployments will happen during June. But over about the 8 weeks or so starting later this month is how we foresee those deployments going.
And that will both replace these problematic machines, which will increase the operating performance in our existing facilities and then we are growing our hash rate as well. So that will take Rockdale from the 12.4 EH/s now to a little over 50 EH/s when all those mines are deployed. We're really excited about this enhancement and growth. We've tested these M60S miners -- or M50 miners and other MicroBT miners considerably before making this decision. We're really impressed with the performance that we saw, the resilience under tougher operating conditions. So we're really excited about the results that we definitely see from those miners as we deploy them over the next couple of months here.
With respect to the hosting related litigation, litigation is always unpredictable. I can't really give guidance on that. We are certainly putting a lot of effort and resources towards that litigation. And I think we'll just have to see how it goes from now. Our next question comes from Martin Toner at ATB Capital. Martin? Congrats on the great progress here, particularly, let's say, data center hosting. Can you talk to the drivers of sequentially higher SG&A in the quarter? And maybe what we should be thinking about for a run rate going forward? Sure. So 2 things here. One, again, just touched on, we've had increased level of legal litigation expense as we go through litigation process with these hosting customers. This is not a type of expense that should continue long term, but it's one we're continuing right now. The other point that I would touch on is, as I mentioned in the presentation, we've eliminated the data center hosting segment as a result of eliminating that segment.
Some of the costs that were previously in cost of revenues for that segment have now gone into SG&A. The final point I'll leave you with the commentary there is we're building a large business here. We have built this business into what we now are growing into. So we have built a business for 30 EH/s and beyond. And now with what we're accomplishing at Corsicana and the results we're seeing -- we're starting to see there, we're growing into that newer side.
So as far as what SG&A can look like going forward, I think you can expect $22 million to $25 million a quarter in cash expenses. I think that's a good estimate that we can give right now. And as the legal and litigation expenses that are not ongoing, continuous fall off, hopefully, we'll be able to improve that number. Great. Can you talk a little bit about the curtailment revenue in the quarter. Any puts and takes that are noteworthy? And then have there been any changes to the power strategy since Analyst Day a few -- less than a month ago? So most of the power strategy results are really Q3 weighted. We see some every quarter, but most of them really come in the third quarter in the summer months. And of course, at the end of the second quarter, we get some of that in June. So the approximately $5 million you see from the first quarter, that's us really taking advantage of just limited opportunities that have come up during that quarter and the ancillary services revenue that we always participate in.
So how it plays out in this summer and mainly Q3 coming up here? It is hard to predict. It's going to be based on external factors like weather and generation performance that we cannot control. However, because we have this 345 megawatts of fixed price power because we have these blocks 24/7 and because of what we've learned on the power strategy that we've developed, we are in a really good position to act on the opportunities when they occur here.
So that 345 megawatts, that is Rockdale. So we'll be executing our power strategy at Rockdale, selling power when that spot price of power is exceeding Bitcoin Mining revenue. And then over at Corsicana, we are beginning unhedged and we'll just be responding to the spot prices of power as they occur there, which also gives us the benefit of capturing those very low priced or negative priced hours when they occur as well. Great. Our next question comes from Reggie Smith at JPMorgan. Reggie? I appreciate the disclosure on Slide 9. I'm still not all the way clear on, I guess, the drivers of the sequential increase and your cost to mine. I am looking at the network difficulty component. And it seems rather large in relation to the 4Q number. Maybe a little color on those 2 components of that and the other costs? And how much of that you think is kind of recurring versus onetime-ish? Any color you could provide there and just kind of bridge -- bridge that increase in cost in mind would be helpful? And then I have one follow-up question. Sure. Thanks, Reggie. So first, as you noted, there's about a 20% increase in network difficulty quarter-over-quarter. So that accounted for about [ $4,300, $4,400 ] cost per coin basis increase in our cost per coin. Other costs increased by about $5 million -- I'm sorry, $5,000 per coin for the quarter. So what is driving that is going to be the elimination of the data center hosting business, and therefore, the consolidation of some of those expenses that were previously in that segment, now in the Bitcoin Mining segment.
So some examples of these costs include things like miner repair. Miner repair is slightly elevated at this time. So we hope, especially when we are replacing all our problematic miners, that this cost is going to go down and not continue at least at this quantity. So what I would say is when we look at on Slide 9, our cost per coin, including $6,300 per coin in other costs, I think the best we can do at this time is guide to that approximately continuing. Of course, the halving has an impact on that, but that notwithstanding other costs, which should probably continue at the same rate. But we are going to hope to decrease those by having a lot less miner repair going forward. Got it. And you say miner repairs. You're not repairing the equipment from your hosting partners now, are you? Sorry, let me clarify this. I guess the comments were blended there. I'm trying to figure out like how much of it was kind of the, I guess, the overhead drag from the hosting business versus some of the other things? Yes. So let me clarify. Miner repair costs have always been in cost of goods for self mining. So that is not a new expense. I would say that the miner repair costs have been elevated in both Q4 and then now in Q1 of 2024 -- sorry, Q4 2023 and Q1 of 2024, and we expect that those are going to go down going forward. So -- and these are third-party repair costs. These are the costs that we are paying to third-party vendors for repairing our miners.
The other cost increase quarter-over-quarter by approximately $5,000 per coin. That's largely these other expenses that were previously included in data center hosting cost of revenue that is now in Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue. So some examples of this would be some direct labor expenses, some land lease and property taxes and then network costs and other utility expenses that we incurred. Yes, that makes sense. And then I guess, one big picture question for you. I appreciate the disclosure on kind of the 100 EH/s. As you think about growth beyond Corsicana, does that look different in terms of the size of facility, like, is Corsicana like the last final big facility? Do you think there'll be smaller ones going forward? And I ask that just in light of all of the AI interest and power assets and things like that. How are you thinking about like that next 40 EH/s of capacity kind of beyond Corsicana? What could that look like? Yes. I think that what we have at Corsicana is very valuable because it is probably the last 1 gigawatt site, probably the only 1 gigawatt site that exists and probably the last one that will ever be approved. Access to power is going to be a critical constraint for Bitcoin Miners and these other industries scaling up going forward.
So I think what you should expect to see from us is capturing smaller-sized opportunities. We're not opposed to doing smaller sites. We've merely been acting on the most frictionless growth path that's been in front of us, which has been these 2 sites of a large capacity. We're open to new sites and new opportunities of all sizes, and we're working on that quite a bit right now. So we look forward to sharing more results as those ideas become more actionable going forward. And I guess that could be outside of Texas or maybe even the United States? Or are you still trying to think about staying in Texas? No, we are open to operating, I would say, in the United States and North America. We've operated in Texas because that has been the easiest pathway to growth, and we really like the power market here. We're able to really achieve this industry-leading low cost of power here, which is just so critical in Bitcoin mining. That doesn't mean those opportunities don't exist elsewhere, though. So we look at opportunities all over the country all the time.
International opportunities, I think, to be determined. We're seeing some interesting things in South America and elsewhere. But there's other considerations always just besides power costs. So we look at a lot of things, but I think you could expect to see our growth in North America in the foreseeable future. Our next call comes from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley Securities. Lucas? So my first question is back on the hosting side. And if we were to be on site today, would there still be machines from your former hosted customers? Or have they been removed? Yes. Lucas, so while we terminated our last 2 remaining hosting agreements towards the end of 2023, one of those customers still remains operating on site. So for the first quarter, that accounted for about $3.2 million in revenue, that was included in our Bitcoin mining revenue. And then their power cost of about $4.5 million was included in our cost of revenues for Bitcoin mining. So you would see that one remaining customer there performing -- I'm sorry, operating, while we continue through the legal process here and try to get to a resolution. And the other one is fully out of your facilities at this point? That's correct. That's correct. And kind of taking a step back, would you consider going back into the hosting business? Or is the lesson learned here, never again? Yes. I think that's the lesson learned here. Maybe I'll say a little more strongly than I would say. I think we have seen the best use of this infrastructure and building new infrastructure is for growing our self-mining operations. We want to get maximum exposure to Bitcoin. We want to leverage our efficient cost of production over the wider scale possible. And I think expanding the hosting business really just takes away that valuable infrastructure pipeline, which I think generates the results and better grows our businesses, more what our shareholders are looking for. So we are not looking to grow the hosting business any further. Very helpful. And then just to round this out. When you look at M&A, you mentioned earlier you are inquisitive if you built out a sophisticated corporate development team. Would you rule out any targets that have posting agreements to date? And more generally, what would the ideal target look like? Sure. Let me turn that back to Jason Chung, our Head of Corporate Development. Thank you, Jason, and thanks for the question, Lucas. Look, we -- in the M&A world, we see a wide variety of opportunities. And it's rare to see a target that 100% encapsulates everything you're looking for. So sometimes there are situations where there's an opportunity to make a deal, but it might come with some amount of hosting, for example, or other factors which may not completely tie to our overall strategy. And that's something that we have to take into account when we evaluate some of these opportunities in the market.
So I'd say as long as an opportunity is able to check most of the financial and strategic and operational boxes, the criteria that we have, then we'll consider it. That being said, at the same time, we are incredibly blessed at Riot to have an organic growth opportunity unlike others in the space. And so ultimately, we have to evaluate all these opportunities relative to our ability to control our own destiny at Corsicana and develop our pipeline with full control over what that looks like. And in terms of size, what do you think is the -- is there a sweet spot either in terms of value dollars or kind of megawatts of capacity? I wouldn't say there's a specific sweet spot in size. We do look at opportunities across the spectrum. Obviously, as a large-scale miner, we like looking at large-scale opportunities that can move the needle. But I think there are some interesting businesses that aren't necessarily large scale that may be a little less appreciated by the market or kind of fly under the radar. And so there are some interesting deals that can be done there as well. Okay. We've got time for one more question. Our last question is going to come from Owen Rickert at Northland Securities. I'm on for Mike Grondahl today. So just quickly, I guess, what's your confidence level on getting to the 31 EH/s by the end of the year? And what are some of the challenges you might face or you're currently facing to get there? Thanks for the question. I think we feel pretty confident about our ability to execute on that growth target. We're taking things step by step here. I would say a lesson that we learned from Rockdale was rushing too fast to get every miner online as quickly as possible, kind of oftentimes miss some steps that you have to come back and address later.
So we're very incrementally approaching the development year. The big milestone was energizing that substation. That was huge. We're very proud of that. And now it's a matter of just incrementally putting up these buildings, deploying the immersion equipment and putting the miners in and going from there.
So we're making these deployments step by step, and you can expect us to see this continue over the rest of the year. The challenges are really just kind of the small things that will come up in any large development. As you build and scale out more, you'll incur different problems like, hey, this electrical switch needs something, this networking thing needs resolution here or this immersion system needs to be altered quite a bit.
None of them are critical or big roadblocks. They are just the kind of punches that you roll with in this business. And through our experience in building this infrastructure at scale, we've become quite good at identifying small issues, resolving and then just continuing to move forward. So kind of to wrap that up, we're very confident about our 31 EH/s goal, and we are just marching forward on that for the next 7 months of the year.
Okay. That concludes our Q&A. Thank you, everyone, for listening in to our presentation and for the questions from our analysts. Very excited about what we have executed on Corsicana. We'll be providing updates as we always do on a monthly basis going forward. And look forward to speaking with everyone and sharing more results after the end of Q2 and Q2 results in August.

Actual results could materially differ due to factors discussed in today's earnings press release in comments and responses made during today's call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which will be filed today after this call as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason Les, CEO of Riot Platforms. Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. Riot's primary strategic focus has been on developing a leading vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company built on the three key pillars of: one, developing and owning operations of significant scale; two, being a low-cost producer of Bitcoin; three, building a balance sheet of strength.
During the second quarter of 2024, we've demonstrated success at all three of these pillars. Riot successfully energized our Corsicana facility, increasing total deployed hash rate quarter-over-quarter by 77% from 12 EH/s to 22 EH/s and exceeding our quarter end target of 21EH/s. We also raised our 2024 deployed hash rate target from 31 EH/s to  36 EH/s and our 2025 deployed hash rate target from 40 EH/s to 56 EH/s. These growth plans remain fully funded as a result of our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet.
The second quarter of 2024 was the first quarter of Bitcoin production, which predominantly occurred following the halving event, which occurred in late April, and which led to a reduction in the Bitcoin block subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. Additionally, global hash rate grew by 6% quarter-over-quarter. Both of these events created bearish headwinds for Bitcoin miners when it comes to the cost of mining. Despite these events, Riot's direct cost to mine in the second quarter remained extremely competitive and was well below the average price per bitcoin during the quarter.
These outstanding results were aided by our unique power strategy, which generated [ $13.9 ] million in Power credits during the quarter, resulting in an all-in cost of power of $0.027 per kilowatt hour during the quarter while also supporting the Texas grid during times of disruption in supply and demand.
Following the close of the second quarter of 2024 on July '23, Riot announced the acquisition of Block Mining, a privately held Bitcoin miner operating in Kentucky. This acquisition immediately adds 60 megawatts of operating capacity with the potential to quickly expand to 110 megawatts this year by leveraging existing infrastructure and a pipeline to build to over 300 megawatts in total in Kentucky. This adds approximately 16 EH/s of total hash rate capacity and provides us with a clearly identified growth path to 2 gigawatts of potentially accessible power and 75 EH/s of potential hash rate deployed. We remain focused on the growth and enhancement of our Bitcoin mining business. Riot's focus is maximizing Bitcoin mining results, and our strategy is enabling us to execute on this at an unprecedented scale.
I would now like to turn the call over to Colin Yee, CFO of Riot Platforms. Thank you, Jason. I'm excited to present Riot's financial results for the second quarter of 2024, during which Riot achieved a number of key milestones. For ease of reference, Slide 5 presents a snapshot of key financial and operating metrics for the second quarter of 2024. So let's go over some highlights on the following pages.
Riot owns and operates the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world, the Rockdale facility, where we continue to deploy miners and expand our self-mining capacity during the second quarter. In addition, during this past quarter, Riot successfully energized our new Corsicana facility, which when fully developed, will supplant the Rockdale facility as the largest dedicated Bitcoin mining facility in the world.
As a result of the successful energization and development of our Corsicana facility and ongoing development at our Rockdale facility, Riot ended the second quarter with an installed hash rate of 22 EH/s, a 106% increase relative to the second quarter of 2023 and exceeding our prior guidance of 21 EH/s.
Alongside additional growth in Kentucky, resulting from our acquisition of Block Mining, we now anticipate achieving a total self-mining cash rate capacity of 36 EH/s by the end of 2024, up from our prior guidance of 31 EH/s.
During the quarter, Riot mined 844 Bitcoin, which represents a decrease of 52% from the 1,775 Bitcoin we mined during the second quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by the block subsidy halving event, which occurred in April 2024 and the significant increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty, which increased by 68% from the second quarter of 2023.
However, driven by the significant growth in our hash rate capacity expected through the remainder of the year, we anticipate producing more Bitcoin per day by the end of 2024 than we did in the first quarter of 2024, having non-withstanding.
Riot ended the second quarter of 2024 with 9,334 Bitcoin, an increase of 28% relative to the 7,265 Bitcoin that we held at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Riot continued to retain 100% of all Bitcoin produced in the second quarter.
In the second quarter of 2024, Riot reported total revenue of $70 million as compared to $76.7 million for the second quarter of 2023, a 9% decrease year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue at the company's engineering division.
During the quarter, Riot reclassified third-party hosting revenues and costs into other from Bitcoin mining, as previously reported in the first quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $30.3 million as compared to non-GAAP gross profit of $26.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $75.2 million as compared to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2023.
Riot's adoption of FASB's final standard on crypto assets issued in December 2023, which Riot now recognizes its Bitcoin held at fair value and with it, changes in fair value now recognized in income. As a reference, Bitcoin price at the end of the first quarter of 2024 was $71,333 and the price at the end of the second quarter was $62,678. This resulted in a mark-to-market downward adjustment of $76.4 million in the second quarter.
Net loss for the quarter was $84.4 million or $0.32 per share compared to a net loss of $27.4 million or $0.16 per share for the same period in 2023, which included a loss from the change in the fair value of Bitcoin held equal to $76.4 million, noncash stock-based compensation expense of $32 million and depreciation and amortization of $37.3 million. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we adjusted our depreciation schedule for mining hardware from a 2-year to a 3-year schedule based on our evaluation of market practice and our own operational history.
For the second quarter of 2024, Bitcoin mining revenue totaled $55.8 million, a [ 12% ] increase relative to second quarter 2023 Bitcoin mining revenue of $49.7 million. Bitcoin mining cost of revenue primarily consists of direct production costs of Bitcoin mining operations including electricity, labor and insurance, but excluding depreciation and amortization. Bitcoin mining revenue in excess to Bitcoin mining cost of revenue for the quarter was $20.5 million, representing a margin of 37% as compared to $26.1 million or a margin of 52% in the second quarter of 2023. This decrease in margin was primarily driven by the halving events and the significant increase in global hash rate quarter-over-quarter.
If power credits were directly allocated to Bitcoin mining cost of revenue, Bitcoin mining cost of revenue would have decreased by $13.9 million, increasing our Bitcoin mining margins of $34.4 million or 62% on a non-GAAP basis. In spite of the global network hash rate increasing from an average of 568 EH/s in the first quarter of 2024 to 604 EH/s, a 6% increase and the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, Riot's cost to reduce Bitcoin in the second quarter only increased 9% on a per Bitcoin basis and costs on a dollar basis actually decreased to $30.5 million from $36 million in the third -- in the first quarter of 2024.
Direct cost to mine this quarter totaled $25,327 per Bitcoin, of which direct power costs amounted to $14,890 or 59% of total direct cost to mine a Bitcoin. While direct nonpower costs, which include direct labor, minor insurance, minor and minor related equipment repairs, land lease and related property taxes, network costs and other utility expenses totaled $10,437, or 41% per Bitcoin.
As previously mentioned, the having had an increase in the global network cash rate and an accompanying increase in network difficulty were the primary drivers behind the slight increase in Riot's average direct cost to mine Bitcoin in the second quarter. This was offset by an increase in power credits as compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Riot's engineering business carried on through Riot's wholly owned subsidiary, ESS Metron, reported revenue of $9.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $19.3 million for the same 3-month period in 2023, a decrease of $9.7 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to supply chain constraints resulting in decreased receipts of materials, delaying the completion of certain custom products, and therefore, the recognition of revenue.
Our custom electrical products such as switchgear and power distribution centers are used as important components in data center development and in power generation and distribution facilities, and there has been increased demand for these products due to the continued increase in data center construction by developers as well as the continually increasing worldwide demand for power.
Engineering gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 million as compared to a gross profit of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. We anticipate a strong second half of 2024 for our engineering business, driven by continued growth in demand primarily from data center customers and the completion of complex legacy projects.
I will now turn the call back over to Jason Les. Thank you, Colin. With Riot's expansion into Kentucky, we now have access to 2 gigawatts of total power capacity and are well on our way to securing enough power to achieve our growth target of 100 EH/s of self-mining hash rate. The pipeline enabling this growth consists of 700 megawatts of capacity at our Rockdale facility, 1 gigawatt at our Corsicana facility and more than 300 megawatts of operating and potential capacity in Kentucky.
Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2024, Riot announced the acquisition of Block Mining, a private Bitcoin miner with operations in Kentucky. This acquisition represents Riot's first major acquisition since 2021 and marks Riot's first strategic expansion outside of Texas. The acquisition of Block Mining immediately increases Riot's hash rate while significantly expanding our development pipeline of new growth opportunities, broadens Riot's footprint nationally and expands our operations into new mining-friendly jurisdictions, adds exposure to new energy markets outside of [ ERCOT ] in which Riot can continue to leverage our unique power strategy while helping to support local grids and brings on board an experienced management team which will continue to operate existing assets and leverage strong local relationships to drive further growth opportunities.
As a result of our acquisition of Block Mining, Riot, gained two additional operating data center facilities in Kentucky. First, Commerce Drive, which currently operates 35 megawatts of capacity in [ Paducah ], Kentucky. And second, Blue Steel, which currently operates 25 megawatts of capacity in nearby [ Calvert ] City, Kentucky as well as on Greenfield expansion site also in Kentucky. Both operating facilities already offer immediate expansion opportunities. Commerce Drive can be potentially expanded up to 100 megawatts leveraging existing infrastructure. And Blue Steel can be expanded up to 55 megawatts.
Additionally, while at present, there was approximately 18 megawatts of capacity being used to host third-party miners on site, 8 megawatts of this capacity is subject to change in control provisions, which Riot intends to exercise while remaining hosting contracts will wind down over the next few quarters, further adding to Riot's self-mining capacity. Together, both operating facilities currently operate 1 EH/s in self mining and 60 megawatts of power capacity, which we anticipate will be expanded to 4.8 EH/s of self-mining hash rate and 110 megawatts of power capacity by the end of this year.
[ Coleman Road ] Riot's new greenfield development site has the potential to be developed up to 150 megawatts, which would bring the total expansion capacity from our acquisition of Block Mining up to a total of 305 megawatts, representing a significant portion of the additional capacity we require as we work towards our goal of achieving 100 EH/s of total capacity.
Under Riot's existing MicroBT [ ASIC ] minor purchase option, which carries a $16.50 per terahash price cap, Riot can fully develop these assets for approximately $345 million or $30 million EH/s deployed, inclusive of total consideration or $21.8 million for EH/s when excluding the purchase consideration. This compares favorably with Riot's historical cost per exahash deployed during Phase 1 at our Corsicana facility of approximately $40 million EH/s.
The Block Mining team has a proven track record as a low-cost developer of Bitcoin mining infrastructure and as a low-cost bitcoin miner. Operating in the mid-continent independent system operator, [ MISO ] Power Grid, Block Mining had an average power cost over the past year, equal to approximately $42 per megawatt hour. And an average CapEx build-out cost of $210,000 per megawatt a day across [ Commerce Drive ] and Blue steel.
Riot has strived to provide clear guidance on our growth plan and just as importantly, where we anticipate this growth will come from. We believe that providing visibility on not just overall growth plans, but also on the specific sources to achieve this growth is a vital element in demonstrating the credibility of any Bitcoin miners growth forecast.
Thanks to the groundwork laid out over the past few years as we have focused on developing our Corsicana facility, we have the benefit of a clear path to achieve significant growth in the coming years. This clear path includes growth from additional expansion opportunities at our Rockdale facility, continued development at our Corsicana facility and immediate and near-term added capacity in Kentucky, as well as additional pipeline opportunities as a result of our acquisition of Block Mining.
Executing on all of these growth opportunities, alongside our low-cost fixed price purchase options with MicroBT for latest generation ASICs will bring it to 75x EH/s in total capacity, well on track towards our long-term goal of reaching 100 EH/s.
Riot's long-term purchase order with MicroBT continues to improve Riot's fleet efficiency, now at 24.5 joules per terahash. To date, our orders for new miners from MicroBT have been received at or ahead of schedule as we have now received approximately 77,734 miners with the vast majority already deployed. As additional new generation miners for MicroBT are received and deployed, Riot's total fleet efficiency will improve to 21 joules per terahash in 2025. If it executes it exercises its long-term purchase option of [ 265,066 ] [indiscernible] miners, total fleet efficiency would improve to below 20 joules per terahash.
Riot continues to prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant financial resources, including cash, marketable securities and Bitcoin holdings in order to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. As a result of our financial position, we can act decisively and continuously scale our business to meet the growing opportunities in the Bitcoin mining space.
This balance sheet strength based on $639 million in cash and marketable securities and 9,334 Bitcoin, enables us to confidently plan our growth funding needs ahead of time. In fact, growth plans to the end of 2025 calling for $694 million in capital expenditures are already fully funded.
Riot's vision is to be the world's leading Bitcoin driven infrastructure platform. The strategy we've been executing on over the past several years has now begun varying the results, which position us to realize this vision. Through our vertically integrated strategy, we have created an unmatched infrastructure growth pipeline to increase our hash rate by 193% to 36 EH/s by the end of this year and ultimately to our goal of reaching 100 EH/s in total self-mining hash rate.
Riot's balance sheet strength underpins our ability to achieve our growth targets. And as a result, our 2024 and 2025 growth plans are fully funded. We are incredibly excited about what Riot is accomplishing this year, and we look forward to executing on our stated goals. Thank you all for listening to our presentation.
We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Greg Lewis of BTIG. Operator, can you open the line? Jason, congrats on getting Corsicana [indiscernible], it was a long time coming. I guess, but the question I have is around what's next to Corsicana. So as we kind of think about that next 600 megawatts, what else -- what needs to happen to get there, i.e., in terms of procuring additional equipment, maybe expanding the substation and probably also as we think about, are there any additional approvals or permits that are going to be needed to get to that gigawatt down in Corsicana? Thanks for the question, Greg. So first off, we're very encouraged about what we're seeing with results at Corsicana. So we are excited to scale up and leverage these advantages over the base of operations that we've created.
What's very valuable about Corsicana is that 1 gigawatt interconnect that is already fully improved. We have 1 gigawatt approved with a large flexible [ load ] task force. We have the required FDA to access all that power, all of the required regulatory approvals are there.
So the next step to building that second phase, that 600 megawatts, would be procuring the transformers and equipment necessary to expand the substation and then all of the equipment necessary to build out an additional building. So then you have switchgear, medium voltage transformers, low voltage gear immersion tanks, et cetera.
So now that we're starting to get some operating time under our belts here at Corsicana, we're able to identify which products we like best for the second phase. So we're very excited to monetize that full capacity of 1 gigawatt of Corsicana. We are making the development plan now for that second phase. We're going through the process, putting these together, getting bids from vendors. And I think in due course here, we'll be able to share an update on what those plans look like in terms of time line cost and other particulars about that.
But we're very excited about taking that full site to the full 1 gigawatt. Okay. Great. And then just pivoting a little bit, as I think about ESS Metron and that acquisition, realizing that ESS Metron's #1 customer is Riot. As we think about the potential capacity to scale up or fill down, I mean, clearly, there's demand for ESS Metron's services equipment, that only seems to be rising with increases to the grid, increases demand for data centers, obviously, increasing demand for Bitcoin mining.
I guess, as we think about the ability to scale that business over the next 2 to 3 years, how should we be thinking about the potential to like deploy capital in that vertical to kind of get and maybe unlock the potential that ESS has to towards a broader market? Yes. So first, Riot is actually not ESS Metron's largest customer as far as I'm aware. They have a -- we're a small cost customer overall. As you're noting, Greg, with the extension of the AI [ HPC ] data center space, there is huge demand right now.
Their results that we kind of touched on a little bit last quarter have been impacted as of late by supply chain constraints and some major legacy jobs that have been taking up all of their capacity. So we've done a number of things to alleviate that. Over the second quarter, we believe the supply chain constraints -- and we -- once this job clears through, which is expected to happen in the second half of this year, now we'll be able to start doing all these jobs in the data center AI HPC space. So we're pretty excited about that.
We are also -- we've been working to secure additional floor capacity, so they're able to do more production at one time. And we have been looking at other opportunities to scale that business as well. So I don't have a definitive number or any type of guidance like that to give you, Greg. But I can tell you, in addition to scaling our Bitcoin mining business, we are focused on making sure ESS Metron is equipped to capture the opportunity in the data center space as well. Okay. At this time, we'll take our next question from Darren Aftahi from ROTH MKM. Operator? You guys you hear me? I hear you, Darren. Great. Two, if I may. First, just as we think about [indiscernible] going to [ 100 ] in light of you guys buying Block Mining and talking about the cost for exahash being more favorable than Corsicana. I'm just kind of curious with the [ entree ], maybe the last halving cycle, we have as many people chasing power assets, now we kind of have a new category there.
How are you guys thinking about kind of achieving that goal? And are you seeing more of a challenge to procure larger power assets, i.e., over 100-plus organically? Is your growth strategy going to involve more acquisitions?
Second question, obviously, we all came back from Nashville. There's a large presence on the conservative side. And I know there was also some [ Democrat ] presence. So Jason, I'm curious to kind of get your views about how you feel like crypto and Bitcoin is going to play a role in the election beyond just the Republican party and even RFK and then what your general thoughts are for Democrats, I think will come around in this, you'll have maybe even more of a tailwind than you already do right now? Thank you, Darren. Okay. So first question on how we look at achieving 75 EH/s. The foundation to our business has been this vertically integrated strategy where we focus on getting access to power. So that's why we prioritize Corsicana going back over 2 years now, securing that capacity so we would have that 1 gigawatt pipeline. So that is our #1 focus always at Riot. How can we secure this power capacity and we've been successful doing that organically with demonstrating our results and our community benefit in Texas. And as you noted, Darren, we're doing it inorganically as well. I think Riot has the best corporate development and M&A team in the industry. We are scarring over all deals at any time. We're diving into deals in incredible detail. And we're moving forward with those that we think are accretive and those that will add capacity to Riot.
So you'll see us doing both of these things to get to our ultimate goal. We're going to continue to pursue organic opportunities, leveraging Riot's internal development and sourcing capability and we're going to be in the market looking at deals. But as always, being very, very selective. Number one priority, I'll just leave you with at Riot, is securing this power capacity and getting the equipment necessary to develop that capacity.
On to your second question about Nashville and public policy. So Riot had -- we began investing in our public policy effort about 2 years ago because we saw the threat looming around this entire space. We saw a whole of government tax on this industry. Whether it be in Congress, whether it be the SEC, the White House, the Treasury department, there have been attacks at every angles. So we knew we needed to -- in order to protect our own business in the whole industry, being investing in this and working with our peers, working with industry groups to educate and advance this industry.
We have had success on both sides of the aisle. While you know Nashville had a predominantly Republican presence, we -- at the conference itself and in addition to before the conference and all the time, work collaboratively with some very strong Democrats who get this issue and just trying to advance it. I think what we're seeing playing out is the game theory that people apply to Bitcoin and lots of different angles.
It takes one party to begin embracing Bitcoin more in a regulatory framework and support for the industry to show the other party why that's important. And I think we're already seeing that play out. Prominent Democrats who are allies to the [indiscernible], have been writing letters to the national party encouraging a shift in this issue. There's been news reports of Vice President Harris's campaign, looking to reach out to the industry and reset relations.
So we see this as success of our strategy in action. As more prominent politicians, lawmakers get behind Bitcoin, there's an incentive for other politicians to do the same. And the end result is going to be, Bitcoin is a nonpartisan issue, because Bitcoin is important to everyone. That's the goal that we're trying to work towards. Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes at B. Riley Securities. Operator? Thank you very much, Phil. Good afternoon, everyone. Jason, I wanted to ask a little bit about the [ HPC ] side and the amount of attention it has been getting in the industry. A number of your peers talking about kind of using gigawatts, megawatts to host GPUs. And how does Riot think about this? Well, one, in terms of the portfolio of power that you have? And then to more broadly, how it might impact the industry? Thank you, Lucas. So our business plan is to be the best Bitcoin miner in the sector. Kind of our thesis is, no Bitcon miner has perfected this yet, including Riot. Everyone has a different take on approach, everyone is still figuring this out. So what we want to do is devote our time, our resources to optimizing our Bitcoin mining operations, scaling those operations and being the best Bitcoin miner that we can.
We believe over the long term, this foothold of Bitcoin mining, combined with the price appreciation that is forecasted for Bitcoin will pay off long term. That will be the most valuable use of our power. While there's discussion in the industry of certain players getting contracts or getting involved in AI, it really does take a different development capability. So for us, that would be a distraction. We will be excluding our operations in half. We would be building a different type of infrastructure that would be costly or timely to revert back to Bitcoin mining or maybe not possible at all, if that -- commercialization of that capacity didn't work out.
So we think it's important to stick to our long-term strategy, Riot always been consistent on building and developing Bitcoin mining assets. Now how this will affect the whole industry? This recent AI HPC phenomena?
Well, I think we're seeing there is a massive competition for energy assets. These AI data centers are looking for capacity wherever they can find it all over the country. Frankly, for these assets to reach all of their capacity goals and the growth goals, they're going to need more generation. We believe that ultimately, loads like Bitcoin mining help drive more generation. But Bitcoin mining loads are flexible, AI HPC loads are not necessarily flexible. So Bitcoin miners help bring that reliable baseload demand for energy generators with the flexibility to turn off at peak time. And this -- Bitcoin mining is going to be a tool to bring more generation forward.
I still think we have an advantage with what we're able to do in different communities, operate in more rural areas where maybe these other data centers may not be able to operate. I think it's also challenging to build and more expensive, certainly to build AI HPC infrastructure in a very hot [indiscernible] where you can make Bitcoin mining work. So there's more competition for power capacity, and I think that is a proving Riot strategy of prioritizing sourcing capacity now we have this 1 gigawatt that we can build on. We have the organic pipeline to already get us very close to achieving our ultimate goals. Jason, thank you very much for the perspective and congratulations on the announcement regarding Block Mining and the details you shared on the M&A strategy. I wanted to ask about the next steps in regards to your investment in bid farms. Anything you could share at this point? Sure. So as of right now at bid farms, we have no outstanding proposal. I know we had a proposal we made public a while ago. That was never tendered to shareholders. That was kind of brought forth as our example of the challenges that we are seeing with bid farm.
Frankly, we see some corporate governance concerns at bid farms. We are the largest single shareholder and based on how they handle their proposal, based on how they handled our relationships with them implementing an off-market [indiscernible], our view is that Board is valuing its own [indiscernible] over its duty to shareholders.
So -- the only thing for our next step right now is the special meeting that's scheduled for October 29. We repositioned that meeting, bid farm's has scheduled that meeting. We've nominated 3, we think, very highly qualified and directors independent of both Riot and [ bid farms ].  We think nominating to those shareholders to the port will bring the much-needed governance changes that we see being required there. So nothing except that shareholder meeting on the plans for right now. Our next question will come from Reggie Smith at JPMorgan. Operator? Congrats on Corsicana and the Block Mining acquisition. I guess I had a follow-up to Lucas' question. And I certainly appreciate the capital intensity and the risks of pivoting to HBC.
My question for you, Jason, is there a structure or price where maybe some of those risks are mitigated or partner where that could be mitigated? Is there a scenario in your mind where you see that possibly you could explore this at the right deal structure, right partner approach you? Thanks for the question, Reggie. Obviously, there's some price where things to be interesting. I think the challenge that we see is the pricing that is generally going to be out there is perhaps less then we see as a long-term upside in Bitcoin when you factor in uncertainty.
I think the other things that we're seeing challenging in pursuing these contracts is the duration of them. I think if we look at the space right now, Core Scientific has an excellent deal with [indiscernible]. Their deal is what has got the whole industry excited about this. But we haven't seen that replicated anywhere yet. So my question is, is there demand for that similar type of deal structure that's very favorable to Core over a very long time out there?
I think we're seeing industry chatter on, hey, is there even enough capital behind all the AI HBC development plans that are out there at the pace that these applications are being commercialized. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around that.
So hey, we are rational economic actors. So if at some point, there was something that was incredibly beyond what we could ever potentially do with Bitcoin Mining adjusted for the risk of that business [indiscernible] yes, we would take a look at that. I'm skeptical as things play out that, that's going to be the case. Understood. That makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate the color. If I could add one follow-up, and this may be an unfair comparison. But we track various miners, and we try to look at the operating efficiency. And clearly, you guys had a cost advantage. But I was curious, like internally how you guys benchmark your operations from an uptime perspective? And if there's an opportunity to enhance that? Are you happy with the way you guys [indiscernible] or is there an opportunity to kind of what's that path to improving performance, if you aren't happy with it? Yes, Reggie. I mean, to be frank, if you look at of our recent operating results, we have not been pleased with our uptime going historically, and that's [indiscernible] not improving that. That is mainly coming through with what we have going on at Corsicana. We have improved infrastructure there. We are very optimistic about what we're seeing. We're still in the very early days. We just turned on a ton of [indiscernible] at one time. We're tweaking that, optimizing that as that comes on over the month of July.
But the preliminary results we're seeing have got us very optimistic. And as time goes on, we think that's going to improve. And improve even more.
In parallel, over at Rockdale, we have a lot of initiatives underway. We've talked about replacing some of the problematic miners with microbe miners, and we are very encouraged with what we're seeing in operating results there. So we are holding ourselves to a very high standard. Reggie, frankly, that's probably the biggest priority at Riot now alongside building the new capacity at Corsicana. And I think as we scale up here and leverage this direct energy cost per Bitcoin over a wider and wider scale, combined with improving operating uptime, we're going to see some -- we expect to see some significantly improved results here.
We'll have our monthly update for July next week, and you'll see some of the progress that we've already seen on that front. Our next call will come from Joe Flynn at Compass Point Research and Trading. Operator? Just to piggyback off Reggie's question related to uptime. As we look into the third quarter, can you guys maybe provide an update on the power strategy and maybe any expected curtailment with the hot summer once here? So I don't have any specific percentages of what we're looking at for the summer months. As far as the power strategy goes, in the second quarter of 2024, we received -- we achieved a $26 per megawatt hour cost of power at Rockdale. That's inclusive of our power strategy. And at Corsicana, just buying power at spot and curtailing during periods of high demand, we achieved a $39 per megawatt hour cost of power. So on a combined basis, our cost of power for the second quarter was $27.
August is typically one of the more challenging months in [ ERCOT ], both with respect to and both by extension, the volatility we see in the power market. So if -- so far, Texas has a pretty mild summer. I think that's because we've seen both mild weather and large growth of renewal generation added this year in Texas. So I think you should expect to see a good cost of power for July and then going into August, we'll see if this mild summer continues or not and what level of curtailment comes from that. That's helpful. And could we also get some color to the sequential increase in cash SG&A? And maybe how we should think about that going forward as kind of Corsicana ramps up? Yes. So the increase in SG&A quarter-over-quarter really wasn't because, of Corsicana. I think the main figure that we're really proud about this quarter is how our direct cost per Bitcoin net of our power strategy went up only marginally from around 24,000 to 25,000 per Bitcoin despite the having and despite the increasing difficulty. And the reason for that is we have this low cost of energy. That is what scales linearly when we scale up and these other costs are more consistent.
With respect to G&A, the driver for that cash cost increase quarter-over-quarter was mainly onetime advisory fees associated with M&A activity. So we still believe our run rate for G&A is around $25 million. We're having these temporary expenses that could increase that if M&A opportunities are successful going forward. And we've had some M&A advisory fees in the past quarter as well. But those aren't part of our ongoing cost operations. Our next call comes from Martin Toner at ATB Capital. Operator?
Martin? Martin, your line has been unmuted. May I request you to unmute your line from your side, please? Sorry about that. Quick question about miners. Any thoughts on the strategy to secure the miners to get from 70 EH/s to 100 EH/s? So with our existing MicroBT purchase option, Martin, we have the capacity secured to get to that 100 EH/s. That's if we fully exercised that MicroBT option for 266,000 or so [indiscernible] miners. Of course, under the contract, we also have the ability to upgrade those miners and with efficiency improvements, that would get to even greater hash rate.
Alongside that, we're looking at what all manufacturers are putting out to the market all the time. We're testing what's going on. We're asking questions, we're negotiating. All of Riot's business is always up for grabs, and we like the results that we get when manufacturers of any products are competing for our business. We've seen the benefits of that firsthand.
So short answer to your question, Martin, is the existing MicroBT purchase option gives us enough supply to get to the 100 EH/s, but we're looking at options to go even beyond that. Super. I believe of the revenue was disclosed, which was the remnants of the hosting customer. Can you give us a little update on where that stands? Sure. Let me turn the question over to our CFO, Colin Yee. Thanks, Jason. So Martin, given the status of our third-party hosting contracts, management in conjunction with discussions with our auditors, we decided that it would be more useful information we could include those third-party hosting revenues and hosting costs into others. So you'll see it there.
With respect to sort of the current status on that, as you know, those contracts are generally in litigation. So we can't say anything more than that. Our next call is from Bill P at Stifel. Congratulations once again on the recent Block Mining acquisition. For my first question, I was just hoping you'd be able to share your outlook for Bitcoin mining economics over the near to the term. And how these market dynamics are impacting the M&A pipeline or existing growth opportunities? Obviously, Riot is financially well positioned in this current market. Looking to get some more color there. Yes. Thank you, Bill, for the question. We've seen Bitcoin mining economics stream more than they ever have been. We -- over the second quarter, the industry saw an all-time low hash price, and even today, we're at $46 per terahash per day -- or $46 [ per terahash ] per day. So definitely a challenging time for Bitcoin mining economics. We've had the halving, the price is not appreciated much since the halving but network difficulty has continued to increase. So this is obviously why we focus on having such a low cost of production and focusing on the power strategy first and foremost.
I think this creates a dynamic for why it can potentially have M&A opportunities. Where there are miners who maybe relying on debt or have some type of financial structure where the cash prices make them unprofitable and unable to continue to do business. That is where a more well-capitalized player, like Riot, is able to do -- to find opportunities.
Other things that we can see as miners that in response to these [indiscernible] need to upgrade their fleets. They have outdated fleets, but they don't have the capital to do it. That is where a partnership with Riot through an acquisition is a big win for both parties. So we're looking closely at any opportunities that come up. Like I said, I'm incredibly proud of the corporate development team that we've assembled at Riot, and the detail on which our whole team is able to evaluate transactions on a regular basis, and we are always interested in opportunities to continue to scale our operating footprint. Thank you for that response. Jason, I know your team is super bullish on the Bitcoin space and the outlook here. So I wanted to ask you a bigger picture question. Just based on what we saw transpire at Bitcoin 2024 conference last week, it's evident that the industry is becoming top of mind and has amassed a lot of punching power in the political sphere. Trump [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] all announced some variation of a plan to establish a strategic reserve and to help protect the network hash rate in the United States.
Just curious if you see potential convergence down the road between the state and Bitcoin miners? Any color to that. Yes, I think that is something that we are already seeing at least overseas. Riot -- some of our competitors have entered into partnerships with sovereign wealth funds, which are obviously an extension of the nation state to monetize excess capacity. Where we are to seeing that in the United States is to be determined.
I think we're typically seeing the cheaper energy pricing, the best energy markets where there is not as close to a relationship between government and power generation and the utilities. But our fundamental thesis is -- we're -- is Bitcoin mining is the ideal tool to accumulate Bitcoin. With the low energy cost you your dominant input cost, you can accumulate Bitcoin at a discount to the market price, if you're an efficient operator.
So if a state had underutilized assets and the ability to do that, paired with the desire to accumulate Bitcoin, that seems like a good strategy. I think in the United States will be a bit slower to ever get there. I think in other nations, maybe less democratic nations. Things are able to move a bit quicker with the governments in place there. But in the long-term future, I think we will see Bitcoin mining paired with energy assets at every level of the stack. And of course, that will be -- include a partnership with government in some way. Our next question comes from Brent Knoblauch from Cantor Fitzgerald. Operator? Perfect. Maybe just another one on M&A. How -- what are you guys look for when evaluating the opportunities that are kind of coming in front of you? Is it location? Is it size? Is it access to power? Is it all of it?
And to what extent are you -- would you prioritize maybe adding additional U.S. assets or international assets where power costs might be more affordable, but I guess it might be a bit more unstable from a political environment? And how do you guys think about, I guess, just evaluating that entire landscape? Thanks, Brett. Let me turn that question over to Jason Chung, our Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Development. Brett, thanks for the question. It's an interesting one. So let me tackle that, I guess, part by part. The first part in terms of what we look at when we look at M&A opportunities.
First and foremost is power. Power is always top of mind. So what that means is access to power and cost of power, right? We're in an industry that is cyclical, and we try to take a very long-term view on what that means -- what the cost of power means for us at different points in the cycle that we know are going to come. So finding access to large-scale amounts of power at a price that is economically viable is really the top, I guess, top consideration for us when we look at opportunities.
When it comes to jurisdictions, entering new markets in the U.S., what's interesting about the block deal, for example, is this did represent our first acquisition outside of [ ERCOT ]. Obviously, we're very familiar with ERCOT and how the power markets work there. But the team is less familiar with some of these new markets. And with block as opposed to just acquiring operating assets, we have also acquired a team that has built the block business and has local relationships and local expertise in MISO. And that was really another key compelling aspect to that particular transaction, which made it more attractive for us to pursue and eventually consummate.
So I'd say it's -- when it comes to new markets, we obviously want to make sure we've got the right team and the right expertise in place to pursue that as well. And to be comfortable operating in an environment that is going to be -- is going to continue to be cyclical going forward.
Internationally, we -- just given our position in the industry, we do see a lot of opportunities outside of the U.S. as well. I'd like to believe we're one of the first calls that people do make when they want to reach out to the large public miners about new opportunities internationally.
The challenge there is kind of similar to even just moving outside new jurisdictions from [ ERCOT ] is what's our familiarity and comfort level with moving into that new market? Who are the partners we're talking to? And ultimately, even if it comes with what looks like a lower price on power, do we feel the rewards outweigh the potential risks. And so that's really how we evaluate international opportunities. We're not close to it, but I think the threshold from a risk perspective is higher, and so the reward to offset that would have to be correspondingly higher as well. And maybe just one quick follow-up on -- I don't know if you felt like the capacity auction today in [ PGM ]. Is the Kentucky assets within PGM or no? No. The Kentucky assets are in MISO and in the TBA, Tennessee value Authority. So not in PGM. Our next question is from Mike Grondahl at Northland Securities. Operator? Just a follow-up on the Kentucky acquisition. What do you guys see as the operational challenges there? It's pretty small today, but the growth looks pretty significant. What do you see as those operational challenges? Let me turn that question back over to Jason Chung. Thanks, Jason. Right now, the Block Mining team operates about 1 EH/s of self mining capacity. We want to get that up to the [ 15.8 ] end of next year target. And I think one of the benefits -- one of the strategic benefits to this deal on both sides is really what we're tying is this huge opportunity for the team the availability of expansion capacity tied with Riot's strong balance sheet and the availability of capital that we have to contribute to that.
So I think in the near term, the focus is really going to be on building out on the existing opportunities to expand and also to take advantage of getting access to more power through new PPAs. They bring the relationships on the ground, and we bring the capital and capabilities to help make those happen. So from that perspective, I think there's really interesting [ marriage ] of the two companies there. but it's really going to come down to just building out and taking advantage of the expansion opportunities that we have on the ground. Our next question comes from Mike Colonnese from H.C. Wainwright. Operator? Congratulations with all the progress of course in [indiscernible]. That's a lot of hash rate in a short amount of time. So great to see that.
First one for me. Do you guys plan to deploy air cooled or immersion infrastructure as you build out and convert Block Mining's pipeline of opportunities over the near to longer term here in Kentucky? And if you could just share what you're seeing in the market today as it relates to the cost per megawatt to build air cooled versus immersion. We've been hearing talks of emersion really starting to come down on a price per megawatt basis. So you guys are experts in the space. I wanted to get your thoughts there. Sure. So at Kentucky, Mike, we are going to be building a mix of both air cooled and immersion. Currently, all of their operations are air cooled. We believe, though, that immersion will likely be in place for expansion. But we -- I don't think we would be looking to retrofit any of the existing air cooled operations, at least in the near term. I think they've shown very strong operating results with their air cooled assets.
If you look at the cost per megawatt, like many things I think you see in the sector, it depends on what you're including into that cost. And I think you may recall at our Corsicana Investor Day and our deck there, we had a breakdown of the cost per megawatt and things that are included in there. So when we look at building out something like -- for example, Corsicana, what we include in that is the substation expansion that's needed because at that large capacity, we want to own that on substation have the advantages that we get from that.
Other operators, if they're building out on a smaller scale and not needing to build a substation then -- and they are instead leasing access to capacity, which reduces your upfront cost but has its own risk like any time you're leasing versus buying and owning, then you're going to have a lower CapEx cost.
As far as the immersion goes, I think that there are more and more players entering the space. Some of the equipment -- there's a bunch of equipment that goes into it. So what may be you may be getting a better price for example, on a dry cooler, but maybe I think is more expensive or maybe the fluid is getting cheaper, but pump equipment is more expensive. So there's a bunch of equipment there.
I don't think that we've seen too significant of a change in that market yet. But we're still in the process of getting bids and determining what we will put together [indiscernible] to expansion in Corsicana. So it's kind of to be determined what that final pricing will look like. And then after going through that exercise, we'll have a better answer to your question. Got it. Got it. I appreciate the color there. And how do you plan to integrate the management team from Block Mining into Riot? And what are some of the noteworthy resources skills that this broader team really brings to the company? I know you highlighted boots on the ground local relationships with MISO. But any other notable skill sets or resources that this team could bring on board? Yes. The Block Mining team has done an excellent job building that capacity very quickly and showing strong operational uptime. So they've demonstrated they are excellent Bitcoin miners from the development and operating standpoint, and that is very advantageous to us. So you couple that with their local relationships and capacity that they've been able to secure for growth and they can be out in Kentucky, doing what they've already done, being good at what they do and growing the capacity out there.
So they really fit into Riot basically as our Kentucky division. We have, of course, the core of our operations here in Texas. And then now we have this Kentucky [ ARM ] operating base as well. And what's great is all of these teams can work together to share knowledge. Bitcoin mining is a game of a cumulative knowledge over time. There is no book on how to do this. So everyone can share what they've learned works and what doesn't and make [indiscernible] We've got one more question from John Todaro at Needham & Company. Operator? Congrats on the hash growth here. Two for you. One, do you see a world where the HPC AI stuff starts to become a competitive pressure to Bitcoin mining? Do you hear that even Texas might be suitable for those sites? So do you see a world longer term or maybe Bitcoin mining is pushed outside the U.S. or the other even more remote locations? That's first question.
And then second question, just wondering if you do diligence [ Jack Dorsey's ] new mining rigs, they did that big deal with Core Scientific. Just wondering if you have any thoughts on that chip in that rig. Sure. Thanks for the question. So starting backwards, I'll tell you, we are speaking with all manufacturers and evaluating things on an ongoing basis. [indiscernible], you're having a great team here. I won't comment on specifically in anyone's products while discussions are ongoing. So I know Block has invested a lot in achieving this goal. It will be very interesting to see how they progress. So we talk to them as we've talked to all others, but I don't want to give any direct commentary on anything that's not necessarily public at this time.
As far as competition with AI, yes, I do think bitcoin miners will be competing with AI HPC for access to power. I think Bitcoin miners are a bit easier for the grid to get comfortable with than AI HPC because of the flexible nature of our operations. So I think it is a little bit easier. Bitcoin miners have an advantage there in getting approved for capacity.
Given that they claim mining is our core focus, if more capacity is being used for AI and HPC, or other miners are diverting their capacity to AI HPC instead of Bitcoin mining. That means the network cash rate and thus Bitcoin mining difficulty is growing slower, and that's good for us. There's less competition. Okay. At this time, there's no further questions. We thank everybody for joining Riot on our second quarter earnings call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in November. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.
