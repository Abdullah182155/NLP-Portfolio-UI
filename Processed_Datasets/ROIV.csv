At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference call. Mr. Paul Davis, you may begin. Good morning and thank you for joining today’s call to discuss Roivant’s second quarter results and business updates. I’m Paul Davis, the Head of Communications at Roivant. On the call today we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer, who will be presenting. We also have Richard Pulik, our Chief Financial Officer; Frank Torti our Vant Chair; Eric Venker, President and Chief Operating Officer; Mayukh Sukhatme, President and Chief Investment Officer; and Todd Zavodnick, the CEO of Dermavant. For those dialing in via conference call, you can find the slides being presented today, as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We’ll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I’d like to remind you that we will be making certain forward-looking statements during today’s presentation that reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our product candidates. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we have filed with the SEC, including the earnings release in Form 10-Q filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties.
We will begin with Matt Klein, who will review key business updates across Roivant and Vants including updates from Dermavant, Immunovant and Aruvant, he will provide a financial update. We will end the call with a Q&A session.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Paul and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our first earnings call ever in Roivant’s history. It’s a pleasure to be talking to you today and to be sharing some updates about the business.
Before I talk about the quarter, I want to start on Page 4 with just a reminder of who Roivant is and why we’re excited about the business that we’re building. Yes, what we’ve said since the beginning of Roivant’s history is that we’re here to redefine what a big pharma company can be from end-to-end, focusing in particular on a novel talent model, in which we’re organized as a family of small nimble entrepreneurial biotech companies that we call Vants, as well as focusing on using computational tools and data in a differentiated way to improve the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines.
On Page 4, I highlight some of the key highlights of our business. Starting with, we have a number of Vants with quite a broad pipeline and a number of different technologies that we think enable us to do better at our business. We are well funded with a $2.5 billion cash balance at the end of the September quarter. We have and we’ll spend some more time later today talking about it.
A full chip-to-clinic discovery platform with we believe best-in-class computational capabilities, for simulations, molecular dynamic simulations, which enable us to do a better job at discovering, in particular in the field of novel protein degraders. We have a collection of public equity stakes in Vants and other businesses that we built over time of $940 million value, plus additional private holdings, including approximately 12% stake in Datavant, which is a business that we built to solve an important healthcare data problem the siloing [ph] of healthcare data that we needed in order to improve our own clinical development.
And as you may know, earlier this year, we merged Datavant into a company called Ciox Health, and in that transaction we received $320 million in cash proceeds, as well as this approximately 12% ownership stake, assuming a $7 billion value for Datavant, which was the value implied by the investments made by Goldman Sachs and [indiscernible] in that transaction. And Datavant is now a business with $700 million dollars in top line revenue which we expect to grow over time. So that’s an ownership stake that in addition to providing strategic value to revenue, we’re excited to have and to continue to optimize.
And finally, most importantly, for us is, we’re planning to build a pharma company, we have what we believe is a strong clinical development track record, having run nine registrational phase three studies in total, eight of whichever have read out positively, and that our Vant model has now resulted in four FDA approved products, all of which advanced launch by launched by Roivant and now owned by our partner Sumitovant.
On Page 5 is a little bit of an outline for the topics we’re going to cover today, starting with an update on our commercial plans with some further information about our expected launch of tapinarof in psoriasis with further opportunity in atopic dermatitis. And I’ll talk a little bit about progress in our clinical development pipeline, including initiation of at least four Phase 2 or 3 trials in 2022 with seven trials expected to be ongoing by the end of that year.
I’ll provide a brief overview of our small molecule drug discovery platform with our computational capabilities and integrated wet lab, again, focused on the field of targeted protein degradation. I’ll give an update on our financial performance for the quarter, including our cash balance of $2.5 billion, as well as some other key metrics. And I’ll end by providing just a couple of highlights for things that we expect to be important drivers of growth and opportunity for the business in the future. So thank you very much, and as Paul indicated, there’ll be an opportunity for Q&A at the end of the call.
So with that, I’m going to start on Page 7 with a discussion of tapinarof. Datavant’s topical therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, where we filed our NDA and where we expect a PDUFA action in the second quarter of 2022. So this is a medicine that obviously we are extremely excited about and we view it as an incredibly promising new therapy for psoriasis patients. We feel that it differentiates along five key attributes.
The first is treatment effects. We showed strong data in our Phase 3 program, which read out in the summer of 2020, including statistically significant performance in all of the key endpoints, including endpoints typically used to measure the performance of systemic therapy. And then perhaps even more exciting, we demonstrated continued improvement, and a high degree of disease clearance, over -- about 41% of patients achieving complete disease clearance a PGA score of 0 and our long term extension study showing 3. That’s gets to the second important attribute of tapinarof, which is durability, the continued performance on therapy with no evidence of tachyphylaxis during our long term extension study.
The third important differentiating attribute of tapinarof is its remittive effect. And so in our long term extension study and we’ll talk a little bit more about this data which was presented this quarter. When patients in our long term extension study cleared their psoriasis, when they achieved a PGA score of zero, we took them off therapy and monitored them. And we saw a mean duration of remittance; that is they stayed clear or mostly clear for 130 days, or over four months, which is something that, in our opinion is effectively unheard of in topical therapy.
And then finally on safety and tolerability, this is a therapy that avoids many of the safety and tolerability issues associated with the current mainline therapy for psoriasis treatment, namely topical corticosteroids with no treatment related serious adverse events in any of our studies or across 2200 patients enrolled in 18 clinical trials with a profile consistent with all of our previous studies and with critically no duration of use or skin location limitations which again is different from the current approved category of topical corticosteroids. So, these are five attributes that we think are important for tapinarof’s differentiation.
On Page 8, I provided a reminder of which I think most people are familiar with, which is tapinarof is really a two in one program, targeting the two largest markets in immuno-dermatology, psoriasis where I mentioned we expect an approval decision in the first half of 2022, as well as atopic dermatitis, where we currently have a registrational clinical program underway that I’ll talk about a little bit later. And these are markets that are expected to reach over $30 billion in the U.S. and over $40 billion globally by 2026.
I want to remind everybody that topical treatments serve as the bedrock of dermatologic treatment in America today, and represent 83% of all U.S. prescriptions written by dermatologists in 2020. So this is a type of therapy that we expect will be incredibly impactful to the psoriasis community.
I don’t think I need to provide much of a reminder on Page 9, given the common nature of both of these diseases, but these are a brief overview of what both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis look like. And I’ll say it briefly that I personally am a psoriasis patient and so I experienced many of these symptoms myself and have for most of my adult life.
On Page 10, I want to highlight briefly some data that includes both data we put out some time ago as well as new data we presented at the EADV this quarter, which is the results of our PSOARING 3 long-term extension study. So this was a study that monitored patients on therapy up to a total of 52 weeks. And in particular, I want to highlight one of the effects and of that I am most excited about, which is the 41% of patients treated with the tapinarof in the program achieved a PGA score of zero, that is completely cleared their psoriasis. And this effect was consistently observed, both for patients who entered the LTE trial clear or became clear during the LTE study. So this is a significant and repeatable effect that we saw in our Phase 3 study in our extension study that was exciting to us.
Now, equally important on Page 11, is some additional data that again, we presented at the EADV, the Dermavant team presented at the EADV, which is that once we took patients off therapy, and I’ve mentioned this beginning of the call, but I’ll describe it again, when patients in the long-term extension study achieved a PGA score of zero, we took them off therapy and monitored them without treatment to see what happened. And we observed a significant remittive effect. These patients stayed clear or almost clear for a mean of 130 days, that’s across 312 subjects who entered with or achieved a PGA of zero during the extension study.
The mean duration of that remittive benefit was 130 days. So these are patients that are going on tapinarof are clearing their psoriasis disease burden, and then are remaining well for a long time, which is significantly different than for example what you observe with corticosteroids, which have a rebound effect when you cease treatment. And we’ll talk more in a moment about the overall profile of corticosteroids and how we differ.
So, on Page 12, and this is something that I personally am very familiar with, as you may know, the current main line therapy for psoriasis patients is topical corticosteroids. So my medicine cabinet is filled with tubes of partially used topical corticosteroids. This is really standard therapy for all patients. And corticosteroids have some significant limitations. You can’t use them for a long time because they cause thinning of the skin. They don’t have a durable effect. There’s sort of a tapering off of benefit. When you go off therapy, you tend to rebound quickly with psoriasis flare ups. And there are safety and tolerability issues, which are the reason that they have duration and location use restrictions, where you can’t use for example, the most potent steroids on parts of the skin that are already thin or sensitive.
Tapinarof effectively addresses basically all of these limitations. We have efficacy that is as good or better than what has ever been observed in studies of topical corticosteroids. We have true on therapy durability, where our drug continues to work better the longer the patients stay on it in our extension study. We have a remittive effect. So when patients go off, unlike the rebounds that you observe with topical corticosteroids, our patients stay clear for a long time.
And then we have safety and tolerability profiles that are frankly in our view more benign by a significant amount than what you see in the topical corticosteroids without the skin thinning effects and other issues, and that means not only can you stay on therapy chronically, you can stay on tapinarof for a long time. And we observed that as I said in our 52-week study, but you can use it anywhere you want on the skin and so for example, my most severe psoriasis is in my outer ear canal. You can’t use a potent corticosteroid there, but tapinarof has no location of use limitations.
Now, all of that is to speak to tapinarof’s possibility as a main line therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Obviously, systemic medicines for psoriasis have received a lot of attention from the dermatologist and investor communities over the past decade or so. The other thing that we observed is, even when patients ultimately with severe psoriasis or moderate to severe psoriasis, get put on a systemic therapy, two-thirds typically receive a new topical prescription as well. And in addition to tapinarof’s possibility as a main line therapy for these diseases, we also see it as a good partner along with biologics and systemic therapies in that setting.
So, I was speaking mostly here to tapinarof in psoriasis where we expect the first approval decision, I’ll highlight on Page 13, that we are also currently running a Phase 3 program in atopic dermatitis. The study design is shown here on Phase 3. We began the study earlier this year, and we said we expect to see data from the study in the first half of 2023, so a significant expansion of the possible patient population. And as a reminder, this study includes a number of patients, includes patients all the way down to age two and so we think it’s potentially an important expansion of the patient population once that data comes out.
On Page 14, as a reminder, we have already conducted several Phase 2 studies on tapinarof in atopic dermatitis and we show the results of our Phase 2 data on Page 14, which achieves statistical significance at week 8 endpoint. So we’re excited about the prospects for that drug in the atopic dermatitis study.
The thing I’ll end with on Dermavant, on Page 15, and you’ll have a chance to hear from him, from Todd in the Q&A is, in this area and this is indicative of the Vant model as a whole, one of the keys to the success of the Vant model is our ability to recruit extraordinary leadership teams with deep therapeutic areas of specific expertise. And I could not choose a better example from our portfolio within Dermavant where Todd and his team have extraordinarily deep experience in the field of dermatology. They have overseen multiple blockbuster product launches across a number of companies. And they are working hard every day to prepare for tapinarof’s launch pending our approval decision. So you know, you’ll have a chance to hear from Todd during the Q&A today, but I think we are incredibly optimistic about the prospects for this program, given the quality of the team that is leading it.
So from here, I’m going to go on to the next topic for today, which is I’m going to talk about progress at our development stage pipeline, including reminding people of the breadth in some of the major programs that are in late-stage clinical development. So on Page 17, as a reminder, you can see our development stage pipeline, which includes a number of therapies, and you know, per the flexibility afforded by the Vant model, you can see that these span different therapeutic areas, they span different modalities. We have biologics, we have topical agents, we have oral small molecules, we have antibodies, a number of different kinds of agents across therapeutic categories and that’s some flexibility that we feel is afforded to us by the Vant model.
So I’ll start on Page 18, with a reminder on the progress of batoclimab, which is also known as IMVT-1401, our anti-FcRn and antibody being studied at Immunovant. So Immunovant as you know is also a public company and has provided their own updates recently. We are excited for this market. We think anti-FcRn is an important fundamental biological target, affecting very large patient populations and diseases mediated by pathogenic autoantibodies. And we think batoclimab in particular has some key differentiating attributes, including a true simple subcutaneous route of administration with a simple straightforward injection.
And it was designed for that route of administration from the very beginning. And it was one of the theses on which we in-licensed it. And then flexible dosing potential with the possibility to obtain deep, rapid IgG suppression in the short term, and with the ability to adjust that IgG suppression with flexibility in the long-term. And that’s the sort of thing that winds up being quite important in the treatment of these patients with these diseases. As people often think about induction, and they think about rescue therapy, and they think about other sort of flexible attributes of dosing that we think are going to matter in the indications that are relevant here.
So what we’ve said and what Immunovant has said remains true is that we are finalizing our plans to initiate a number of clinical trials in batoclimab next year. And the final piece of that is we are awaiting feedback from the FDA, which we expect this quarter on our proposed trial designs and so Immunovant will provide an update before the end of this year on that feedback from FDA and our plans, and we look forward to providing that update and to continuing this program and development important.
I will next starting on Page 19, talk a little bit about Aruvant, which is our Vant developing gene therapies for rare diseases. And in particular we have two therapies there, one is ARU-1801, a Lentiviral gene therapy for sickle cell disease, which we think has unique potency driven by a modified -- by delivery of the gene for a modified form of fetal hemoglobin that we’ll talk more about the efficacy that we observed. But in particular, it allows us to get even better anti-sickling properties and therefore even better clinical outcomes than fetal hemoglobin alone. And it allows us to do so with less expression of the gene. And therefore critically, and we’ll spend a few minutes on this, with reduced intensity conditioning, rather than the full myeloablation required by other programs in development. So we’ll talk a bit more about that program.
And then the other program in our Aruvant, ARU-2801 I an adeno viral gene therapy for hypophosphatasia which has shown in preclinical data durable increases in tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase through 18 months. And it has the possibility to be a one-time prescription or one-time therapy to replace chronic enzyme replacement therapy as standard of care with IND enabling studies currently ongoing.
So I want to talk a little bit on Pages 20 and 21, about the efficacy that we’ve observed in our first four patients in our Phase 1/2 study in ARU-1801. And as a reminder, we began process development and improvement work between patient two and patient three, when we in-licensed this therapy from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. It’s as you can see, on Page 20, these were patients that were quite sick at baseline with a significant number of pre-treatment vaso-occlusive events over the two-year period before. And these are patients that had failed a number of different pre-treatments, including hydroxyurea, many different kinds of supportive care, to transfusions and so on. So these are our six severe sickle cell patients.
From what you can see on Page 21, is that we observed a dramatic improvement in the condition of these patients. Even the first few patients on the original academic manufacturing process observed a near complete elimination of vaso-occlusive events, and to date, and we provided this update at our R&D event in September, we have observed no vaso-occlusive events in these patients through 18 months in the case of patient three, and through 12 months in the case of patient four, so effectively a complete clinical cure of the symptoms of sickle cell disease, so something that we are extremely excited about.
Now, on Page 22, which you may know from following the field, there are a number of other people developing promising genetic medicines for the treatment of sickle cell disease and there are exciting gene therapies and there are exciting gene editing approaches out there. The key difference for our therapy, and this is something I highlighted a moment ago, is that it was originally designed with the idea that this modified form of fetal hemoglobin would allow us to use a reduced intensity preconditioning regimen. And so all of the other therapies that we are aware of with clinical data have demonstrated that data using an intensive mal ablative regimen using busulfan as a mal or ablative preconditioning agent, whereas our therapy because of this modified form of fetal hemoglobin, we have been able to dose using a reduced intensity conditioning using a melphalan based regimen.
And you know what, why does this matter? I mean, in short, the patient experience on this melphalan base conditioning, most of the tolerability issues associated with any of these therapies actually relate directly to the preconditioning. And in the case of busulfan, these patients are spending dramatically longer in the hospital. So that’s 44 days on median versus somewhere between zero and five days for melphalan with the possibility that this will be outpatient procedure by the time our product is approved.
We are seeing a significantly reduced risk of ovarian failure. Remember, these are young sickle cell patients, you know, 30% to 40% instead of 70% to 80%. And one of the major risks associated with busulfan is its enormously immune suppressive. And so, these patients, who are at significant risk of secondary infections and be much, much, much faster recovery time for melphalan based preconditioning significantly reduces that purely risk.
And then busulfan is also in studies been associated with secondary malignancies over time and that is also a significant issue associated with busulfan based preconditioning. So our prediction is that these differences will matter enormously to the sickle cell patient community and make for a very differentiated profile, even amongst the curative genetic medicines in development for sickle cell disease.
So as we’ve mentioned, this is in our Phase 1/2 study right now. We continue to enroll patients in that study. We expect to continue to enroll patients into next year. We will provide updates on this program as we get new data, including the investigator, Poonam Malik is making a presentation with some additional data on our patients at the ASH Conference in the coming weeks and we are ready to continue to provide those updates. And we expect to put ARU-1801 into a pivotal study in the beginning of 2023.
So across our portfolio, we expect to initiate at least four Phase 2 or 3 studies in 2022, including as a Immunovant has guided, multiple pivotal studies in batoclimab across multiple indications, as well as, we have not spent a lot of time talking about this program, but we will start doing some more in the new year. We remain on track to initiate our Phase 2 trial with namilumab, our anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody in sarcoidosis, that kind event in the first half of 2022. And that’s an important disease with poor current treatment options, and comparatively many patients. And so it’s something that we are again, looking forward to speaking more about, as well as Phase 2 trial in LSVT-1701, which is our novel into license for potential treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, that again, could address significant unmet need and we’re excited to begin that trial next year as well.
So, moving on from our development stage programs, and we look forward to continue providing updates as we have them. I want to provide a reminder about our approach to drug discoveries, which is also an important, and important pillar of our strategy on a going forward basis. And as a reminder, first of all, much of our clinical pipeline historically, in many of the programs we talked about today has been assembled by in-licensing. So we often, we take a target an opportunity based thesis approach to figuring out which programs to add to our pipeline. And we have teams that were even -- that are responsible for boiling the ocean, looking for new therapies that match the issues we’ve identified.
And as we’ve said, over the past several years, we’ve repeatedly gotten excited about targets and opportunities where when we look for programs in-licensed nothing quite fit the bill. And so we started to invest a number of years ago in a discovery platform that could complement our in-licensing efforts and allow us to work on a broader set of programs that we’ve identified.
And so on Page 25 is sort of just a schematic of what that platform looks like. And critically, it includes both, we believe a leading computational drug discovery platform, combining molecular dynamics and AI and machine learning, that allows us to do free energy calculations and simulate biological motions, including agonism, including searching for novel allosteric binding sites, all kinds of bias signaling. And as well, and I’ll talk about this in a moment, as we believe is the most precise simulation of ternary complexes, which is the combination of a protein and E3 ligase necessary to achieve protein degradation. So to make predictions of the important ingredients in successfully degrading a protein, which is one of the reasons we are focused on the area of targeted protein degradation.
Now, in addition to the computational platform itself, we believe we have world-class teams focused on this area, with from the computational side, folks like Woody Sherman, our Chief Computational Scientist, who comes to us by the acquisition of Silicon Therapeutics, and who has been responsible for, he worked at Schrödinger for a long time, building many of the most important tools out there in this area, and has now built the next generation version of our molecular dynamics engine with this team algorithm discovery.
And then an extraordinary team of wet lab chemists and wet lab, biologists, and biophysicists working to complement that engine across a number of different facilities that enable us to generate novel biology, chemistry and biophysics data, which critically our computational platform has been specifically designed to ingest and incorporate and that feedback loop, the combination of world-class wet lab biophysical data, with world-class computational tools, we think provides real differentiation, a vis-à-vis other computational companies that don’t necessarily have the ability to integrate that wet lab data, as well as vis-à-vis any of the other degrader companies, for example, that haven’t made this kind of investment in computational tools. So it gives us a unique position in the degrader landscape.
So on Page 26, I highlight one of the important features there, which is our ability to simulate and I mentioned this before, binding and instability of ternary complex formation, which we think has the potential to be very important in structure based design of novel protein degraders. So this is, we think, the most accurate simulations ever made of the position and conformation of the combination of an E3 ligase with a protein with a degrader, so that we can start to make predictions about which degrader designs will most effectively recruit and stabilize ternary complex formation, and which of those in turn will maximize the probability and magnitude degradation.
So, we are already actively using these tools in a number of our degrader programs, and we show on Page 27 our discovery stage pipeline. So we spoke previously about our development stage pipeline. We have a number of programs between Proteovant and Roivant Discovery, across principally degrader, but also occasional other small molecule inhibitor modalities across targets ranging from highly clinically validated targets like our androgen receptor degrader program, which we expect will be the first of our degrader programs in the clinic in 2022, to other programs across the pipeline, in a combination of biologically validated and novel targets, where we think we have an opportunity to be either first or best-in-class. So excited to continue to provide updates on our discovery efforts as we advance these and other programs through preclinical discovery.
So I want to say a word on Page 29 about our financial results for the quarter. So, first of all, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents increased this quarter from $2 billion as of June 30, to $2.5 billion as of September 30. And that increase was really driven by three things. It was driven by the closing of our SPAC transaction, it was driven by the funding of the second $100 million invested in Proteovant by SK Holdings, and it was driven by the $320 million in cash proceeds that we received, at the time of opposing Datavant merger with Ciox Health, that I talked about earlier.
As far as our expenses for the quarter, so our adjusted non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $104 million. Our adjusted non-GAAP G&A expense for the quarter was $69 million and that led to a net non-GAAP adjusted loss for the quarter of $169 million. And I’ll highlight that the, probably the most significant adjustment we made in this quarter, is that we get a relatively significant $370 million one-time share based compensation expense charge. It was related to the closing of the SPAC transaction, and so that was one of the adjustments that we provided, and you can see a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in the appendix of this presentation.
And then finally, as I said, we’ve had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter, with debt of approximately $200 million, almost entirely related to commercial milestone obligations in Dermavant for tapinarof. And then we have $684 million approximately common shares outstanding as of November 10, 2021.
So, before we turn to Q&A, I just want to remind everyone of a couple of opportunities for relatively near-term growth that we expect to speak more about in the coming weeks and months. And so on Page 31, you can see a schematic of Roivant today. There are many Vants in our portfolio and we’ve had a chance to talk about a few of them today, so we look forward to opportunities, including conference presentations and other forums, to speaking about more of our development activities and more of our Vants generally.
One Vant that I am particularly excited about is, Genevant, which has been called out on this slide, where we have an LNP platform that is working on novel next generation LNPs to deliver nucleic acid therapeutics and we’re working in a number of important scientific collaborations to advance that field. And we have an extraordinary team there, dating back to some of the earliest chemists involved in describing and manufacturing liquid nanoparticles as well as, some really exciting scientific collaborations and a board IP estate.
And then the other area that I would flag, that we have not talked about today, but we expect to do so in the near future, is the launch of a number of potential new Vants around in-licensing activity, around programs that we’ve identified that we think are interesting. In fact, we’ve mentioned today that we’ve in-licensed one such program that we’re going to talk more about in the near future, but there will be others as well. So, I am excited about those updates to come and excited to share them.
As a final reminder on Page 32, I just want to highlight the rich series of catalysts that we have upcoming in the next year, and that includes as mentioned, the FDA approval decision on tapinarof for psoriasis, as well as, upcoming top line Phase 3 data on tapinarof trial and atopic dermatitis. It includes a complete set of updates on batoclimab, IMVT-1401 and Immunovant, including the re-initiation of multiple chemical programs, as well as announcing new indications and beginning those clinical programs as well.
And then, continued updates from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of Aruvant and more detail about our initiation of our Phase 3 program there, multiple other trial initiations and multiple different opportunities to provide data coming out of our preclinical discovery activities. So, we are excited about the quarter and the year ahead. We think we will continue to have a number of important updates and we look forward to taking every opportunity that we can to communicate them.
And at this point I want to thank everyone for taking the time for listening today and I want to wrap-up the presentation portion of this and hand the call back over to the operator for Q&A. So thank you and I look forward to taking your questions. Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the first earnings call. So, number one, for tapinarof, you noted that a lot of patients and maybe you could restate the percent of patients when they go on their biologic, they also can maintain them on the topical? When you’re thinking about pricing I know you said you haven’t decided yet. How much of that factor in to that decision and what’s your latest thoughts on pricing given insights prices strategy? And the second question is on the IP lawsuit with Moderna, could you give an update on the case maybe give us a sense, just legally, what kind of news we will hear over the next six months? Thanks. So, I will start with the tapinarof question. Thanks Robyn, thank you for joining the call. I’ll start with the tapinarof question and then I’ll come back to the Genevant question. So, I’ll give Todd a chance to answer most of this question, but I’ll just say, first of all, for all the reasons mentioned I’m really excited about what tapinarof can do, even in sort of, main or first line therapies psoriasis patients are not just to med concurrent setting. And as you said, we haven’t given guidance on price, but there’s a pretty wide envelope from the lower prices of generic corticosteroids today too, you know Tesla at $3500 a month I think and some of the other therapies at higher prices. So we have a wide range to look at.
I’ll hand it over to Todd to give his thoughts on the two questions that you asked. Hey, thanks Matt. Good morning. Hey Robyn, how are you? Thanks for the questions. I think the first response you had asked us to repeat, I guess Matt shared pretty much known in dermatology two-thirds of biologic therapy, two-thirds are receiving topical medications concurrently. So in all of our advisory boards, it’s very well shared, but this is just a normal practice within dermatology. Keeping in mind that for tapinarof a label is obviously with a mild, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and again in our study we took a look at mild at 10%, 80% of the patients moderate and 10% severe, where really the majority of prescriptions reside in mild-to-moderate. So for us it’s just, when we talk to physicians it’s a wide-open opportunity of where tapinarof will be used across the spectrum for patients.
I think your second question on pricing, yes we have time and it is exciting to go back to Matt’s first point, which is we’re bringing not only a novel mechanism of action to this space, but we’re bringing a target product profile, with that novel mechanism that is unmatched. So, when you look at efficacy, you look at the durability Matt talked about, and then really the remittance, that’s really where physicians will share, this with the topical and biologic like properties and then safety and tolerability. So, for us, really we need to take a look at that.
When we look at recent medications that were brought to market with black boxes and you’re seeing prices in the $1900 range, we’re just going to take a look and do the work that we need to do and price it accordingly, because the other key point to take away is, it’s not only the five attributes that differentiate tapinarof, it’s really the 2 in 1, transformational asset that it is. So, it’s this crossover mechanistically between psoriasis and AD, so we have some work in front of us. Thanks Todd. And may be to take the Genevant question, so as I think you know Robyn, the pending research legal processes around, is appealed in the IPR process. So back in 2018, Moderna filed IPRs against a number of Arbutus Genevant patents. And after a number of those IPRs were decided in Genevant’s favour, there was an appeal hearing in October on the patents numbered 069 and 435. I will say Arbutus and Genevant’s scientists have been leaders in this field for two decades and we have strong convection in the strength of the pattern portfolio.
There’s a number of different outcomes that could come from that appeal decision. I think we would expect it on sort of standard timeline, measured in a small number of months, but think it would be difficult to potentially inappropriate to speculative on what the outcome of those appeals to be. And we’re looking forward to providing update, once we’ve got it on what that looks like and then process from there. Okay great. [Indiscernible] Have you had to do a combo study, for combo use, when you go on your biologic, do you have to do any study? I know steroids it seems like that seems easy to do, so do you have to do additional work to get that use once you’ve launched? Thanks. Yes Todd, please? Yes, okay, no problem, Matt. No, Robyn, I think at the end of the day, like I had shared our study was versus placebo with the indication for mild, moderate, severe, so all of plaque psoriasis. I think the dermatologist will just get there and I think it’s just natural treatment regimen of what we’ve been shared with and our advisory boards, I think it’s been shared with all companies that are innovating in the nonsteroidal space, which is where this whole market is shifting, as we look to the future. So, I’m sure that within the Phase 4 of the investigated initiated programs, they’ll be looked at, but it’s not something we need to do, we’re not going to be promoting it. I think the dermatologists have just educated us that this will actually happen, because it’s been happening well before us even coming to market. Thank you. Thank you, Robyn. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao from H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first, maybe on tapinarof, I’m just curious, how do you see the product, do you see the product being used differently in psoriasis versus tapinarof, meaning do you see it being used in combination with biologics more and more than versus the other frontline therapy and one versus the other? And does that affect or sort of influence how you think about pricing? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Doug. I appreciate the question. Thanks for jumping on the call. I think your question is, do we see tapinarof as being used differently in psoriasis versus atopic dermatitis? And yes, I think it’s a good question for Todd. No, thanks Doug for the question. No, look, I think we see tapinarof being used first line. I think there were four patients with psoriasis. I mean, and that’s what we’re going to be promoting it for and in the mild-to-moderate category with the majority of prescription start. I think that the beauty when you launch a product like tapinarof with again, these five attributes, and a novel mechanism of action that make it totally different, is we’re not asking the market to change. We’re not asking physicians to change anything they’re doing, because the majority of patients have already failed on steroids.
They’ve been looking for a product that’s non-steroidal, that has efficacy of a Class I steroid, but it’s also being able to be used anywhere on the body for any length of time and when you stop medication, you’re able to provide a benefit where patients are staying clear for a median timeline of up to 130 days. So for us, I think, Doug, you’re not asking people to change what they’ve been doing. You’re asking them to increase the level of standard of care to the new future and that’s what tapinarof is bringing. I think you’re going to see that across psoriasis and you’re going to see the same thing across atopic dermatitis. Okay, great. That’s really helpful. And then just and this one follow up just as you think about the pipeline and the development of the business, how do you feel that sort of scaling and just given how broad your pipeline already is and between the discovery engine as well as further business development, at what point do you think you need to maybe sort of pump the brakes a little, just make sure that the business gets ahead of yourself? Thank you. Yes, thanks, Doug. That’s a good question. Before I -- before I jump to that, just one more comment on the tapinarof question you had asked. Yes, I think an important point about that tapinarof AD study is, it does go down to patients all the way to the agent two. And I think the point there is to provide the kind of flexibility to dermatologists. And this is exactly the point I was making, the kind of flexibility they are used to the existing drugs. So, back to your question about sort of expanding the pipeline.
I think the short answer to that question is, when you think about our history, and I think this is not unique to Roivant, at any given moment, it feels like you are, you’re always constrained by something relative to what you want to do. And it feels like you flip flop between being constrained by talent. And I think that’s sort of to the scale question, being constrained by capital, and being constrained by the number of available opportunities that are exciting. And, I think we’ve always felt one of those constraints over time.
I feel that we are in a very fortunate capital position right now. And recently, we’ve seen some really exciting opportunities come across our desks that we’re excited to pursue and excited to share. So I think the main constraining factor to us is to make sure that we can assemble Vant leadership teams fast enough, in order to take advantage of the opportunities today and I think what you’ll see as we bring in new programs is making sure that we’re doing so spooling up leadership teams, including internal and external talent quickly.
And I think as long as we can keep those three things, kind of in lockstep with one another, we should see significant opportunity to further growth from this point. Now, part of that is the Vant model and the one thing I would say is, we are a company approaching a major commercial launch with tapinarof, and the reason that I feel comfortable focusing on other things, is because we have such an extraordinary team at Dermavant able to launch that product, and we have high conviction in their capability. I think that just gets to our proven track record in recruiting people like Todd and the team around him. So that’s kind of how I feel about that. Thanks for the questions good questions. Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen. Your line is open. Hi, guys, thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats to the team. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Another one, just another quick one sorry on Tapinarof from us, obviously a lot of interest here in the asset across the board, but just really wanted to kind of poke a little bit and see what else you can maybe tell us about your interactions with FDA since the filing. Obviously, the agency seems a little overwhelmed lately with just kind of everything that’s going on there. So really any color you can give us on your discussions and meetings with them throughout the process? Maybe -- it’s excuse me site inspection, progress, et cetera, any of that would be would be really great. Yes, I think in short, our interactions have been positive and uneventful as you would want. Todd, I don’t know if there’s anything specific you would add to that? No, no, you’re right. I think, uneventful. I think they’re, the feedback has been back and forth positive and we’re wholly on track for everything we need to do for a mid-2022 review. Okay, great. And then if I could just squeeze one more in just actually about Immunovant also, I know a little, a lot of this is a little bit up in the air here, but kind of just trying to get some of your thoughts on, I guess, first where you’re at in discussions with FDA on batoclimab really what are the final pieces of feedback you’re looking to receive to kind of get these studies up and running again? And then really, just maybe kind of your strategy for the expansion opportunities here? Obviously, there’s some clear efficacy, but some other players going on. So really kind of just trying to see where you see the best opportunity for the drug. Thanks. Yes, thanks. It’s a good question and something we’re paying a lot of attention to. And obviously, Immunovant I just commented a fair amount on this publicly as well. We are excited for the breadth of the possibility for the program. The flexibility there is an incredibly strong attribute. The ability to dose relatively higher and get deep, fast IgG suppression or dose relatively lower and maintain a stable level of IgG suppression. I think there’s a lot going for us in that and that combines well with the other truly differentiated attributes of our program, which is none of the other programs really have the same level of a simple subcutaneous injection that we do.
So we think the program is well positioned. We think there are indications in which our ability, our potency, our ability to dose higher and get to steep IgG suppression quickly will matter. We think there’s indications where the flexibility and most indications the flexibility is going to matter. So I think you will see when Immunovant is prepared to disclose his trial designs. You’ll see I think, optimizing for all of those features, and it’s something that we feel strongly is necessary to do in order to maximize potential for the program.
In that context, obviously we wouldn’t want to sort of announce a strategy for specific clinical programs until we’ve gotten sign off from FDA for what that look like. And so, FDA is expected to provide feedback to us this quarter. It’s been, I would say, a sort of normal course interaction with them so, it’s not like we’ve received any particular information one way or the other. But we expect to receive that feedback and provide it in due course this quarter. And I would say, once we’ve gotten that feedback, we should be able to provide just a more fulsome update on our strategy across indications, that will give us a pretty clear sense for what our trial designs might look like. Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Your line is open Thank you very much and congratulations from us also on the IPO and the new quarterly call. Three questions, if I may, first on tapinarof the FDA has certainly surprised us recently with the caution they’ve shown with respect to labeling even for topical agents most obviously, with obsolera [ph]. Is there -- should we expect there to be any form of warning language in the tapinarof label associated with exposure or even very high levels of exposure to the active?
And then secondly, couple of financial questions. Do you have any intention to change the current ownership structure with respect to Immunovant or Aruvant? And then lastly, Richard, is your $175 million are expense rate for Q3, the right basis for Q4 and for us to be modeling for next year on a quarterly basis or are there some trends that we should be aware of? Thank you. Yes, thanks, Geoff. Those were all great questions. I appreciate them. I’ll take them in turn and I’ll give Todd a chance to comment on tapinarof question as well. From my perspective, and again, Todd chime in if you feel differently, I think it’s hard to comment on the specific content of a label without having had that discussion with FDA. But I think there’s certainly nothing that we’ve seen in our data that would suggest anything like what you see with [indiscernible] or otherwise. And I will say, it’s very hard to detect, meaning we have very sensitive assays for systemic absorption of tapinarof and we see basically, no systemic absorptions. It’s very hard to detect even on picomolar assays, any level of systemic absorption of the therapy. So that’s kind of where we are with the data. Todd, anything you see would add to that? No, sounds great. Yes, so that was the, you got it Geoff. No, that’s great. Thanks. So that was the first question. The second question was do we expect to change anything with respect to our ownership structures of Immunovant or Aruvant? So I would say, we made a significant investment in Immunovant during this fiscal quarter. That investment was designed to do two things. One is, as you might imagine, is signal that we think it’s an attractively priced opportunity, and we wanted to own more of it.
And the other is, as I mentioned, it’s important that those studies be run to maximize the opportunity for flexibility and to maximize the number of indications that we can pursue in a competitive field. And so we want to make sure Immunovant is well capitalized to do that. We are enthusiastic about the prospects for that program and we’d like to continue to be a major owner of it.
And then, with Aruvant it’s obviously, sort of wholly owned by Roivant, with the exception of the piece owned by Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. I don’t, at the moment, see any near term need to change that, but we are opportunistic, and we’ll keep an eye on the possibilities as that sort of continues to develop.
And then the last question was for Richard about the cash and I’ll hand it over to him in a second to see if he has any further comments. The one thing I’d just note is remember that that $175 million includes our fully consolidated expense. So that includes Immunovant trial expenses as well. And my only other comment on this is, just remember that, because we’re in the business of running large Phase 3 studies, some quarters that will be higher, some quarters will be a little bit lower, depending on which studies are ongoing. But in general, I think you can sort of watch our financial statement. Rich I don’t know if there’s anything else. Yes, we haven’t provided any guidance at this point. I think I would just want to point out on Slide 23, that we expect to initiate at least four Phase 2/3 studies in 2022. So I think, depending on how the feedback plays out from the FDA, and how those studies end up, when they end up running, that will certainly drive a lot of the impact going forward. Geoff, I think we’ll be able, as we initiate clinical programs, we’ll be able to give you a sense for what we expected to cost and how long we expect them to stay. Okay, thanks, I appreciate it. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Ding from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I have two questions. Number one, can you please help frame for investors how to think about or even value some of your past BDs and non-therapeutics, particularly like Silicone Therapeutics, Lokavant? Can you just provide some clarity on like, how does exposure in these areas contribute to Roivant’s overall story particularly over the long term? And then as a follow up, can you just comment on the internal bar or criteria that you guys use when considering building out additional grants? And, are there any interesting areas or technologies that you guys are seeing right now? Thank you very much. Yes. Thanks, Dennis. I appreciate the questions, they are both really good questions. So on the first one, on the sort of non-therapeutic investment, I would say, there’s probably two different categories there. There’s you mentioned Lokavant, and I put Datavant in the category of tools that we have built to make us better at developing new drugs, and they help us design development strategies better or help us run trials better and that we have made commercially available to other partners.
So I think, both of those tools get directly at our ability to be faster and more effective at drug development than we would be without them. And so there’s a sort of direct strategic benefit from them. But I would also just highlight that the outcome with databank is, I think, pretty good indication of our ability to also generate financial value in those opportunities. So, we had put about, I think, $42 million of cash into Datavant in the merger with Ciox, we took $320 million of cash out. And we still own, at the assumed $7 billion value to 12% of the company. And I think I sit on that board, and we are focused on maximizing the value of that continuing to get the treated benefit from it. I think it’s a pretty good example of what we’re shooting for in sort of the tools area or we can build tools that make us better and also generate financial value.
And, on the Silicon Therapeutic side, it’s a little bit different, in the sense that that got to be one of the core pillars of our drug discovery efforts. And we get to our ability to discover and design really engineering new small molecule like drugs in a differentiated way. And there I’d say from a value perspective, I just think about some of our some comps who are doing similar work like, like a relay or like a shorting they are using those platforms for their own drug discovery activities. And then, we are one of the relatively few, first of all, they combined both ML based and molecular dynamics based approaches and then also they had combined those tools with specific wet lab expertise, including in chemo proteomics, in the field of target protein degradation, and I think the combination of those data will be differentially powerful for us.
You mentioned internal criteria, I think, we have a pretty long track record of investment at this point. So you can see generally, that the kind of the breadth and the scale of opportunities that we like to look at, I will say the longer that we’ve been around, the better opportunity set has been. So we’re repeat partners with a number of our both big pharma and academic partners, they view us at this point, as a partner of choice. We get access to some of the most important programs in their pipelines that they want to continue to develop and with a high quality partner.
So I think the bar has gone up over time, only in the sense that our opportunity set has improved. We remain flexible as respect to indication; we remain flexible as respect to therapeutic modality. And it’s one of our business principles that we’ve talked about publicly. We remain contrarian and so I think you will continue to see us going into exciting programs in areas that are important to our partners. And that may be, on one side of the boat if everyone’s on the other. So thank you. Good question. Thank you. Our next question comes from Nina [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Hi, this is Dina on for Nina. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question about Aruvant and what is the current manufacturing turnaround time and is there’ any additional optimization ongoing on that front? Thank you. Yes, so we are continuously optimizing our process there and it’s an important part of any gene therapy development. We are in the process of tech transfer over to Lonza as a commercial CDMO and are looking to do our best to incorporate that into our pivotal program. So it’s an incredibly important area for us. Frank, I don’t think anything you would add to that? I think it’s well said, Matt. We view it as a place for continued iteration and improvement up to a point and then obviously, we want to lock it before we launch the pivotal program. And I do think that COGS has been an issue for some gene therapies, in the past, and we’re focused on, not just the clinical performance, but the overall product profile that we can deliver there, including the cost of that product to deliver what we think will be, potentially curative efficacy for a broad array of patients with much improved side effect profile. So that’s where we’re headed at present. Thank you. I appreciate the questions. Yes, thank you. There’s no further question at this time. You may continue. Great. Well, thank you everybody for joining this morning. As I said, it’s exciting to do our first earnings call as a public company. I’ve enjoyed it. I’m looking forward to doing more of these and continuing to provide updates in our business, at conferences and other forums. So thank you again. I appreciate all the good questions and looking forward to speak to everyone soon. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for joining.

Welcome to Roivant Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Paul Davis, Head of Communications. Please go ahead. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss Roivant's financial results and business updates for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. I'm Paul Davis, the Head of Communications at Roivant. On the call today, we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer; Richard Pulik, our Chief Financial Officer; Frank Torti, our Vant Chair; Eric Venker, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mayukh Sukhatme, our President and Chief Investment Officer.
For those dialing in by phone, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We'll be providing the slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I would like to remind you that we will be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation and reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our products and product candidates. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we have filed with the SEC, including the earnings release and Form 10-K filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties. Matt Gline will review key business updates across Roivant in advance, including the commercial launch of VTAMA at Dermavant as well as Priovant and Aruvant today, and we'll provide a financial update. We will end the call with a Q&A session.
Without further ado, I'll hand it over to Matt. Thank you, Paul, and thank you, everybody, for joining this morning. It's an exciting call for us. It's our first 10-K as a public company. It's our third earnings call, so we appreciate everyone being here this morning.
So I'll start just briefly on Slide 4 and talk a little bit about what's going on in the business. Starting with - and I think everybody is familiar with this, but we have, as of this month, really the commercial launch ongoing of VTAMA Cream and we'll provide a brief update there, although it's still early days.
Behind that, we have a really exciting differentiated pipeline of clinical programs, and we'll talk a little bit about some reprioritization we've made there in part to make room for Priovant, a new vants [ph] that we've announced this morning that's developing a drug that we'll spend a fair amount of time on today.
We also have our Chip-to-Clinic discovery platform with our proprietary tools, including QUAISAR and AI working on a pipeline of preclinical programs against challenging targets. I'll talk a little bit about some collaborations during the quarter there. And there are a number of sources of site [ph] potential upside, including the Genevant IP portfolio and others, all backed by a strong capital position with as of 3/31 [ph] at $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and a significant portfolio of public equity stakes.
So we won't spend a ton of time on Slide 5 on VTAMA today because we just provided the update call a few weeks ago on the approval, and it's too early to say much.
I'll say, we see strong early prescriptions recorded to date. The IMS numbers are here [Technical Difficulty] over time, we'll provide a more fulsome update when we can. I would, for example, expect this week to be a little flatter because our field force is out of the field for their sales meeting. So we'll see it as it goes. But again, really promising early signs and something that is an obvious an important area of focus for us and a major milestone that happened during this period where we've got our first commercially launched product now. So excited about that, excited about the team doing that work and looking forward to seeing how it develops.
So moving on to Slide 6. [Technical Difficulty ]current capital markets in response to some of the opportunities we see outside, including Priovant, which is now a program of ours. We've continued to watch our portfolio, and we've implemented some company-wide cost optimization and portfolio repudiation projects. And you can see on the right-hand side here, we deprioritized some programs, notably among them probably Aruvant, our program in sickle cell disease, where we were just looking at the field there and trying to make sure we felt like we had a portfolio of truly differentiated offerings, and it was hard for us to know whether we were going to meet our squeaky-clean efficacy bar.
So if you move forward to Slide 7. I guess one other point I'll make about capital for us is that we have always run our business with access to capital sources that go well beyond just equity. And in fact, if you look at our history, more than half of the capital that we've raised and deployed since inception has come from sources other than Roivant equity. And we just listed a few of them here as a reminder that we feel very independent of the capital markets.
You know, one, obviously, is revenue from VTAMA Cream, I mentioned again, we expect this to be a potential blockbuster in multiple indications. We've shown in our history a number of important cash-generating partnerships, including out-licensing deals like the Japanese rights to [indiscernible] Pharmaceutical, including discovery-stage partnerships, which are the ones that we've announced with Janssen, the Bluprint and with BI. And obviously, for example, the DSP deal a couple of years ago.
We have Genevant’s IP Estate, which is something that we know people are focused on and which we expect has the potential to be a source of significant capital depending on how that situation plays out. And then we have a monetizable ownership of our advancing other assets, and I'll call attention to DATAVANT. We are a 12% owner of today, which is something that obviously we will be watching as that company continues to grow and evolve, it's something we've talked about a few times.
So jumping ahead to here just to Slide 8. It's been a really exciting period for us just from a pure clinical execution perspective. We have 10 or more pivotal or pivotal enabler trials expected to be up this year. 7 of those are ongoing, including at least 4 pivotals and we'll spend some time today talking about the programs in brepocitinib at Proteovant. And with 3 or more additional trials expected to initiate this year. So we have some real exciting work to go. And we've mentioned a few times. This really is an important period of clinical execution for us.
So on Slide 9, 10 and especially, as I start on Slide 9, we really - we have programs that go beyond what are shown on these slides at this point. But we're really focused on the opportunities in our pipeline and currently outside of our pipeline that have the opportunity to be really sort of differentiated and that are uniquely available and interesting opportunities for us.
And so we've got - obviously, we can at VTAMA and Dermavant where we continue to do both commercial and development work, we have BATOCLIMAB, but we've talked about a fair amount of Immunovant. We have brepocitinib with Priovant. We have a list behind that that includes namilumab, our anti-GM-CSF antibody on Slide 10 and Priovant that includes our SF3B1 modulator or Hemovant for transfusion Dependent Anemia in lower-Risk myelodysplastic syndrome and so on. So a number of programs in our pipeline that we think are differentiated and interesting and really sort of focused on the biggest value opportunities.
So with that, I'm going to switch gears a little bit, and I'm going to talk about something I'm excited to talk about waiting for about 6 months to talk about this publicly as we've been sort of getting it ready. But that is - I'm excited to unveil Priovant, a event built in partnership with Pfizer to develop a potential first-in-class dual selective inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1.
So if you start on Slide 12, I just wanted to - before we go into Priovant itself, I just wanted to note that I think we've quietly built a portfolio of really high potential first-in-class or best-in-class. And some cases only in class programs in immunology across the Roivant portfolio and that includes many I think people on this call are already focused on.
There's broad characterization, we're looking for programs where we have a clear swimming lane the differentiation area of unmet need. And sometimes that clear swimming lane is in the biggest volume segment of the market as with Depin [ph] tapinarof, where we saw a need for a novel topical and inflammatory skin disease, where otherwise systemic agents have been the primary focus of the field.
And sometimes it's in a specific indication or a set of indications where we understand the biology well and there's a clear potential bad actor as many of our FCR indications or with GM-CSF in sarcoid. And then sometimes there's a disease that requires an agent that has a more phltropic effect, and we want to attack it accordingly. And that's, I think, what you'll see with our approach development at Priovant, which I'm excited to unveil here today.
So we closed this deal last fall, and we've been sort of diligently working to get ready to make this announcement at such time when we could say confidently that our Phase II program in DM was underway, which we can now do.
We built a really phenomenal. I want to just [indiscernible] really phenomenal working relationship with Pfizer. They are a repeat partner of ours, and they've been really good partners to us here. And so we're thrilled to partner with them to create Priovant and I am excited to talk about it, talk about it right now.
So on Slide 13, we spend most of our time today talking about brepocitinib, which is the lead program at Priovant. It's a first-in-class dual inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1, which we're developing for specialty autoimmune diseases with kindomortality and morbidity and with limited treatment options. So we'll go through each of these points in greater detail during the call.
But first of all, the molecule has all the sorts of characteristics that we have generally really like. First of all, it's got a unique dual targeting mechanism, and we'll go into why that's important from a biology perspective.
Second, we know that it is a highly active agent. We have a very robust efficacy data set covering a wide range of indications and successful Phase II studies already under our belt. We have a distinctive development strategy and specific indications that play to the strength of the drug and elegantly work around some of the well-known current limitations in the JAK pathway.
And we have two ongoing registration programs are the first readout expected in the second half of next year. And finally, it's a long-tail asset. The composition of matter going through roughly 2039. So an exciting program to have in our hands.
On Slide 14, I just want to start with a little bit of a review of the relevant biologies. So the JAK family JAK1, 2, 3 and TYK2 generally signals via pairwise combinations. So a dual inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1 allows you to mediate the signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines represented by the boxes shaded in yellow on the left and particularly and importantly, it's expected to more robustly suppress the cytokines in the upper right-hand corner, namely interferon alpha and beta, most importantly.
As such the specific dual TYK2 and JAK1 in division is relevant to a signature of autoimmune disease, we can suppress interferon alpha and beta strongly and also hit interferent gamma aisle, 6 out, 12 and out 23, which are particularly relevant in the diseases we're pursuing.
So first noting again, this is not simply another TYK2or another JAK. It's a unique small molecule with a profile that allowed us to tailor a customized precision clinical development plan. And it's also worth noting, this is the only dual inhibitor of TYK2 in JAK1 in any kind of late-stage clinical development. So we think a really interesting opportunity.
So on Slide 15 and some of the studies that have already been made public and some have not. But one thing that we're excited about, Brepo [ph] has a really robust set of efficacy in a range of autoimmune indications. We know that it's a highly active agent shown P values in multiple studies run by Pfizer in every indication that is on values in every indication tested by Pfizer so far.
And we have an extensive safety database as well with exposures in over 1,000 subjects and patients. This shows a profile that's consistent with approved JAK inhibitor rest as you'd expect.
]So then if you come to Slide 16, kind of what's our strategy here, right? What are we doing? And obviously, the world is watching what's happening with JAKs, where do we think we have an opportunity. We talked to Pfizer about our interest here, but we were particularly interested not in sort of the typical JAK markets where there's more competition, both from small molecules and frankly from biologics.
But to go after a set of indications where we felt there was a clear differentiated opportunity. One, where we felt the biology of the disease indicated that both TYK2 and JAK1 would contribute to efficacy. Two, where the diseases had high morbidity and mortality and an urgent need for novel therapies and three, where there weren't a lot of therapies, including in all of our cases, no approved oral therapy.
And this led us to a series of indications, some of which you can see on this slide, with the overall opportunity was high, we felt for a new leading treatment option in orphan disease markets that are largely un crowded. So let's turn and we'll talk about the first couple of these more closely and obviously, more to come in terms of additional indications over time with this program.
So I'll start on Slide 17 with Dermatomyositis, which is a rare chronic immune-mediated disease of muscle and skin affects about 37,000 adults in the U.S. alone. Hallmark symptoms are on the skin and muscle, painful skin rashes muscle weakness often with disfigurement and disability associated with the cycle of inflammation with damaged muscle and damage vascular endothelium tends to lead to damage in multiple organ systems, including pulmonary and cardiovascular systems.
There's significant mortality. A majority of cases are chronic and demand chronic steroid therapy and aren't well controlled even with that. And the only approved therapy apart from steroids and corticotropin is IVIg, which we just got approved recently. It's an advance in the field. It's not a perfect solution. It's Izi the Cumbersome administration. It gets dosed, I think, for like 2 to 5 consecutive days each month with infusion times that are pretty long on each day and with the number of side effects, including an elevated risk of thrombosis. So there's a high need for novel targeted therapies that address underlying DM pathobiology in a chronic refractory patient.
So if you jump to Slide 18, there is some evidence already that JAK inhibition alone has efficacy in DM. So on the left-hand side, there's this STIR study in refractory dermatomyositis where a JAK1 inhibitor was studied in the disease. Notably, the endpoint here, total improvement score of TIS was the primary endpoint in this study with an open-label study, it was the primary endpoint in the study and is the scale used for regulatory approval.
And you can see the blue line is the immediate improvement there. We got to - this JAK inhibitor got to a roughly 40 point improvement. It's worth nothing that every single patient improved. It's all the hash lines on here. The secondary endpoint analysis also showed robust improvement in other relevant for CDASI and steroids variability for those patients that are steroid dependent.
And its worth noting the median improvement in TIS was similar to that which was seen in IVIG leading to its recent approval. Of course, this JAK study was an open-label study.
We also compiled a bunch of case reports where we had seen documented and published in literature, about 145 cases of DM and juvenile DM that were treated with various JAK inhibitors. And this, 137 were considered clinical success by their respective investigators. Again, this is not a controlled study, but this is just supportive evidence for JAK inhibition as being relevant to the field. And many of those case reports noted objective and subjective improvements, including in the muscle skin in lung.
So I think back to the point that I made about sort of why we are in this field at all on why we're excited about brepocitinib on Slide 19. I think it's important to think about where the disease biology fits in here. And again, here, dual inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1, as a reminder, provides optimized suppression of type 1 interferon, which is the T pathogenic cytokine in dermatomyositis. I won't cover all of them [indiscernible], but a couple of lines of evidence for that.
One is that elevated levels of type 1 interferon are found in the relevant organ systems of VM patients. But the second is typo interferon gene secateurs correlate with VM disease activity go down with successful therapy and go up as disease worsens. Direct exposure to type 1 interferon to myotubes elicit a pathogenic response.
We know that hitting both TYK2 and JAK1 seems to be required for maximal type 1 interferon suppression. And finally, in whole blood assays, we see evidence that repairs exactly what you think it should with greater type 1 interferon suppression than TYK2 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors.
So on Slide 20, in addition to type 1 interferon dual inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 also uniquely suppressed other DM associated pathogenic cytokines, specifically interferon gamma IL-23 and IL-12. And this signature is important. And again, you can see in these whole blood assays, the brepocitinib has suppression that compares favorably over TYK2 inhibitor and inhibitors.
So on Slide 21, here's a schematic of the program that is currently underway. We've gotten regulatory alignment of the design. And we believe that these data are robust, at this single Phase III, along with all the other supporting evidence around the compound should be sufficient or could be sufficient for approval.
So moving to Lupus now on Slide 22. So this is obviously a pretty well owned disease among the investor community. It continues to be one of the biggest autoimmune markets, obviously, and it continues to have enormous unmet need. The classic hallmark is to sort of butterfly rash, but it can result in symptoms in basically all major organ systems, and it has elevated mortality. And there's no question there's unmet need here. It's widely recognized by patients, by physicians and by regulators.
Benlysta is an approved therapy. It was proved back in 2011, which was a huge achievement. It was the first part of the region in decades in the indication. But it's proven in spite of a relatively modest effect, a placebo-adjusted delta, somewhere we like 10% to 14%.
Anifrolumab was approved last year was really one positive study. The other is study outright failed and look worse than placebo. But FDA kind of looked at the totality of data, again, there was significant unmet need and the Phase II also look supportive and so was approved.
And so clearly, Lupus is not a solid issue. I'd say a common conclusion is almost nothing ever works. But actually, we think that a lot of study failures have resulted from an attempt to improve upon what's already been successful rather than repeating what's worked and that we can learn a lot from Benlysta in particular, which was positive in all of its Phase III studies despite some challenges on the efficacy side.
And so yes, I think it would be fair to conclude, we view this as a pretty high-risk proposition, and we have some humility in tackling it. But also, there's some important lessons and what's likely to work, and we think we can design a study that maximizes chances for success.
So on Slide 23, for start, we do have recent data for what happens if you inhibit JAK1 or TYK2 in Lupus in these patients. And the good news is there are signs of efficacy with the JAK1 inhibitor, as you saw on the Phase II and one of the Phase IIIs in baricitinib. And then also with the recently announced Phase II of deucravacitinib, which showed some noisy dose response. But again, separation of each dose arm over placebo that we think is a good supporter of drug efficacy. And there's obviously nuances in these study designs and some of them we think made the data look more noisy than - than it really was.
So on Slide 24, I won't belabor this point, but we did just want to show your cross-study comparisons of Brepo versus that - those couple of drugs. It's worth noting all of these diseased have very different biology for Lupus. But just looking at the slide, you can see that Brepo was a really big gun and then it compares favorably to Brepo in each of these indications. So we think we have an opportunity to differentiate.
And look, the biology ought to even play further in our favor, again, given the unique signature of our drug like tramadomysitus [ph] Lupus is known to be a type 1 interferon driven disease and BREPO may provide sort of best-in-class suppression of type 1 interferon signaling and just other cytokines implicated such as SX12 and L12 and L23. So our strategies are built on evidence over the last 20 years that SLE has specific - been relevant and also underscores that you can't go after just want to access for efficacy, if you want robust efficacy.
Anifrolumab provides evidence that Type I interferon integration provides activity in SLE. We're the only one - the only oral go to hit this access is robustly and then Barry [ph] provides evidence that JAK1 inhibition provides modest activities - provides modest activity, which includes our IL-6 and interferon gamma.
Deucrava and STELARA provide evidence with TYK2 inhibition or reductions in L23 also provide some activity in SLE and we're the only drug to hit this whole unique signature.
So on Slide 25, here's the Lupus study design. It's a large global Phase IIb study as all the design features you want from pivotal. It's close to fully enrolled actually. So that's an important piece of news. And we're using a 52-week endpoint. So we expect top line data in the second half of next year, so quite soon.
And then it's important to note here, a feature of our collaboration with Pfizer is the Pfizer is sharing in the expense of this study. It was already in flight when we launched Priovant, but in total, this ended up being a really highly capital-efficient bet for Roivant to make relative to running an entire Lupus registration quality starting from start to finish. And obviously, we're excited to partner with Pfizer on it. And then on the back of this, if successful, we'll just be one study away from approval in a quite large market.
So I'll wrap up on price on Priovant on Slide 26, with is to recap partnerships. So Pfizer as is sometimes the case with our really important partners in advance owns an equity interest, a 25% equity interest in Priovant.
Priovant develops the drug and owns commercial rights to represent in the U.S. and Japan. And we also have similar rights to a mid-stage TYK2 inhibitor. This was a capital-efficient deal for us. So there was a nominal $10 million upfront, which actually included the purchase of inventory of drug in hand [ph]. There's no regulatory milestones at all in a single commercial milestone.
There's a tiered subteams royalty on net sales in our territories and sales that were booked by Pfizer outside of our territories that are slightly lower, but conceptually similar single milestone royalties flowing back to Priovant and back to us.
Yes, we are thrilled to unveil this program. It's emblematic we think of our ability to work with partners, often repeat partners on high-impact therapies with creative development strategies and with some capital efficiency. And I'd say, obviously, a little bit of contrarian in moving into this area with what everyone else are focusing on.
But we think it's going to deliver a meaningful therapy to patients in a range of diseases with high unmet need. So we think this will be one of the anchor programs in our portfolio in the years ahead and looking forward to providing further updates as we continue to execute.
So I'm going to go quickly through a couple of other updates. That was the main new item for the period. But I just wanted to give a couple of quick updates on some other things going on around the portfolio, and then we'll wrap up with a brief financial update and then open line for questions.
So jumping ahead to Slide 28. At Slide 28. We've talked a little bit about this earlier on earlier calls in the press release, but I'll just point out, at this point, we've done multiple strategic partnerships that validate the quality of our discovery pipeline and our discovery platforms, our discovery tooling, including a partnership with Janssen focused on VantAI's learning platform, looking at generating novel molecular losing header by functional protein integrators, a collaboration with Priovant and Blueprint to advance novel protein integrators to address important areas of unmet need. And then an early discovery collaboration with BI. And we think there's sort of more of this to come. And we see a lot of enthusiasm for what we're doing now discovery side with pharma partners who are interested in using the kind of tools and modalities that we bet heavily on. And I'll note that these three deals together have contingent milestone payments of well over $1 billion in addition to potential product royalties.
And then not too much new to say here on Slide 29. But litigation surrounding Genevant's IP portfolio, this situation continues to develop. Since we last provided a detailed update on it. I don't know, as I think many of you may know, on May 6, filed a partial motion to dismiss our claims, which we responded to, and [indiscernible] actually filled it supplied just a few days ago.
So the briefing on that motion business is now complete. So we'll get the court decision when it comes. And I'll just say that rather than to respond to the substance of our claims, they filed the motion to dismiss an unidentified portion, but not all of our lawsuit in an apparent effort to shift responsibility for potential patent infringement to the U.S. government.
And then the only other sort of ongoing relevant litigation is a cites an LNP company on March 18, filed an action against Genevant and our bets looking for a depredatory judgment basically looking for a statement that we are not infringing but they are not infringing on our patents. So we told the court last week that we intend to dismiss that our final motions to dismiss that lawsuit for lack of natural controversy. And so we'll hear back from the court there as well.
So wrapping up today with just a brief reminder of some of the financials of the period on Slide 31, I think we're pleased with where we are from a capital perspective. In the three months ended 3/31 '22, we had R&D expense of $135 million or adjusted non-GAAP of $118 million. We had minimal IP R&D of $2 million. We had $139 million of G&A or adjusted non-GAAP of $77 million of G&A for a net loss of $291 million or an adjusted net loss of $188 million.
And then we've also got metrics on the slide for the full year and our balance sheet, most importantly, remains really strong with $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $210 million of balance sheet debt, which is sort of a credit facility of $33 million, and then the rest of that is effectively the present value of milestone payment said mostly the dormant associated with the notes financing there.
Yes. And then finally, on Slide 32, I'll just say we have a period of really exciting news flow and information and catalysts that we think are things we're watching really closely. That includes obviously continuing to follow closely the commercial launch of gamma that includes tactical data for [indiscernible] dermatitis, a second potential blockbuster indication there in the first half. That includes multiple readouts and a additional program initiations at Immunovance no top line data coming next year for Lupus. It includes sort of upcoming readouts at Kinevant and Hemovance [ph] so in all that in addition to potential output from our discovery apparatus [ph] and other things going on around the business.
So an exciting period of execution for us, an exciting period of upcoming catalysts. And they're really pleased with where we are as a business. And I'm - with that, I'll wrap up the formal presentation. Side 31 is just a non-GAAP - or sorry, Slide 33 is just the non-GAAP disclosures and Slide 34 is a summary of Vant ownership. And so I will - I'll end there. Again, I'll say thank you for listening this morning, and I'm excited to take your questions. So I will turn it back to the operator to open the line. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the progress on the partnership with Pfizer. Two questions for me, one on Priovant. Can you just talk about the decision for Pfizer to outline these assets? I think there's clearly a lot of interest in the class and these trials seem relatively late stage having enrolled already or close to fully enrolled. So perhaps why do you think these assets are in better hands with Priovant versus Pfizer whose cost of capital is presumably lower?
And then my follow-up question is on VTAMA and script volumes and whether these have been tracking in line or better than your expectations thus far? And I guess, especially on pricing, if you can right-size the street on [indiscernible] that would be really helpful. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thanks, Dennis. Appreciate the questions, appreciate your listening this morning. I'll probably take those in reverse order, and I'll take the VTAMA question first, and then I'll give some thoughts on the Priovant question, I also ask Mayukh to work closely on that collaboration to chime in.
On VTAMA, in terms of script volumes, we haven't said exactly what our expectations were. I think what I'll say is we're pleased with the early demand. We're very pleased with the response from the docs that we're out talking to. It is very early days. And so it's hard to look at this and say that we're ready to draw any conclusions. We are excited to see where this goes, and we're looking forward to providing a more fulsome update.
And then on gross to net, I guess I'll just go back to what we said on the launch call, which is we are focused very hard at this stage in the game on getting credible high-quality coverage, which includes the right formulary, which includes the rebating strategy and so on.
I think until that happens, we're not providing specific guidance, but I would expect deep gross to net discounts just because of the way the market works. And then I expect that will normalize once we have credible coverage. And what we've said is that's going to be about 12 to 18 months. So that's kind of what I would say on VTAMA.
On the Priovant and Pfizer question, the first thing I'll say is, yes, I think you can see it in the partnership terms. Pfizer remains excited about this program. They continue to invest in the Lupus trial alongside us. They own 25% of Priovant, they have economics flowing back to them.
And they have a large portfolio of drugs in this general sort of area of the world. And so I think even companies like Pfizer need to pick and choose and make strategic decisions. And I think this was - if I had to guess a tough one for them to let go, and it has to do with the quality of our relationship that they thought it was in good hands with us and that it was going to generate good value for them in this construct.
So that's sort of my high-level answer. Mayukh I don't know if you would add anything to that in terms of how you think Pfizer was thinking about it. Yeah, I think that's right. Thanks, Matt. So I mean, I think, as Matt mentioned, obviously, we view Pfizer is really the world leaders in this specific biology and has a number of other programs, both marketed and late-stage development in these areas. And I think we were looking at the data for [indiscernible] has largely been developing in the sort of the broader indications. And I think that they saw in our proposal sort of a way to develop it in a unique set of indications that, again, really plays the strength of this specific molecule.
I think as you guys probably all appreciate, Pfizer has got a long history now of partnering assets with new codes. They've done it with Cerevel, with Allegen [ph] and with SpringWorks, and we're really excited to move forward with this has been a great partnership. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is open, Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats also on this deal. So I also have a couple of questions on brepo. Number one, can - I guess I have three questions. One, is the collaboration open-ended in terms of indications? Or are you sort of restricted to Lupus and dermatomyositi? They're retaining to develop any other TYK2 or JAK1 independent of view for any indications, including these two.
And then finally, when we look at the prior data, kind of two things to jump to mind, you're right, the data you showed us pretty good. The atopic dermatitis data was a bit weak on efficacy. And then infection, there's obviously some infections, but nothing overly concerning on the safety to address those two as well? Thank you. Yeah, thanks. So I'll let a couple of these things. First of all, the collaboration is definitely open ended with regard to indications. And I would say not only are we not limited to these two, but given the quality of the compound, I think you can imagine we are considering a whole range of things we might do with this. So definitely not limited.
Maybe you can comment a little bit more on the specifics of what Pfizer might be limited to. But in short, I think you can imagine for a company like Pfizer with a portfolio like theirs, they don't have they don't have a lot of limitations on what they can do, but you Mayukh comment on the specifics there.
And then on the safety side, and then I'll hand over to Mayukh to comment on any of these topics. I'd say, broadly, first of all, remember, this compound has been developed extensively. It's been exposed in to over 1,000 subjects and patients. And we've observed rates of, let's say, JAK-class specific adverse events that are in line with those observed in other programs.
From a tolerability standpoint, has generally been well tolerated. I agree with you, things like reflection numbers are not particularly problematic. I think we feel like the safety profile is consistent as favorable for the development strategy we have in mind and it's something we're mindful of.
I think, frankly, the focus on tolerability for JAK inhibitors is part of what has given us the opportunity to do something unique and different here. So Mayukh I don't know there anything you'd add on any of those points and specific if you want to comment on the AD data around any limitations that Pfizer has. Yeah. Nothing really to add here. I mean I think as one might expect, I mean, I think that we were committed to these programs as our sort of expression of our interest in this particular biology.
I think as Matt noted, we don't have limitations on what we can pursue. And I think, as one might expect, I think sort of some of these core indications that we've highlighted today, it was important to us to kind of have proven the way in which Pfizer is expressing interest in these indications as well. Just one comment on the. I think you're referring to the published data- they published some data. The published data was in topical brepocitinib, so our lead compound here is the oral formulation. We have rights to the topical as well. We're sort of deciding what to do with it. And obviously, it's an area we have a fair amount of interest in. But I would say the activity data that we have that's most relevant to us is the data from the oral program. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hi. This is Alex on for Robyn. Congrats on the partnership. A quick question on Roivant, and I want to know if you could provide a little more color on what factors led to the wind down of the sickle cell program? And also how should we think about the approach to future resource allocation for existing events versus interest in additional initiation of subsidiaries? Yes, thanks. Look, it's always a tough decision to wind down the program that you're potentially excited about. And so there were a lot of factors. I would say, chief among them from my perspective, others and a broad desire to be sort of careful about how we're allocating resources in the current environment is the clinical bar for curate therapy and sickle cell disease really is curative. And I think as you look at the development of that field with the other programs, we felt like that bar was really high, and we got nervous that we might not quite achieve this weekly clinical bar there.
And look, these are these are patients with few options. But actually, the pipeline across biotech is pretty broad. It's obviously been a little bit of a challenged area, but we still feel good about the high likelihood that curative therapies using genetic medicine are going to make it to sickle cell patients.
We're obviously disappointed to bow out, but we're incredibly appreciative of the patients that have worked with us and obviously, the investigators that have worked with us as well as our whole team, and it's something that we took a swing at. So yes, it's a tough decision.
I think what it enables for us is to continue to be broad-minded in our portfolio. We have to make decisions like this and we have to make them quickly and decisively in order to be able to do things like this partnership with Pfizer opportunistically, and we think the current capital markets are going to give us even more opportunities of that kind.
And so when we have the ability to make these decisions, it's just something we have to do quickly. So it's something that - it's always disappointing, as I said, but it's just the kind of decision we have to wait to make. Got you. And you mentioned that you got some initial physician feedback on the [indiscernible] label. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Yes. I would say just generally, as we've been out to docs, as our field force has went out to docs are, our leadership team has been sort of out talking to the medical community. I think there's just a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for the label. We obviously were excited about it when we first saw it, but what you heard on the call a few weeks ago was really our in the Derma management team's first impressions of what seemed to be a very clean label. And I think as you get out there, just all the things that we would have hoped resonating are resonating with prescribers. And so yes, we're really excited to watch the progress there as that team gets out and does what it does best. Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions here. So I wanted to ask you a few things. First one, if you could talk about the market opportunity for batoclimab in myasthenia gravis? And where do you think your drug would fit into the treatment landscape if it's approved?
The second question I have for you is, how do you think about tapinarof or Dermavant [ph] and the potential opportunity in psoriasis and in atopic dermatitis? What gives you confidence in the positive data or positive data readout in 2023 in atopic dermatitis? And then can you talk about the pushes and pulls on your cash runway? Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I will - I'll take those questions in some order here. I'll start with the VTAMA question with the [indiscernible] question. We're looking forward to that readout. We like the biology of AHR modulations are much. It's something you've heard us talk a fair amount about. And we think it's important to inflammatory skin disease generally.
And then I would say the thing that gives us most confidence about our readout in the first half of next year is that we have compelling Phase II data in atopic dermatitis that has guided our development strategy, and we feel like we've designed the trial to maximize the opportunity there.
In terms of the opportunity, look, we think it's really, really big. We think we have an opportunity for a blockbuster program in both indications or in each indication. And we're hopeful that our data next year is going to support it.
So on Batoclimab in MG, we've talked a bit about this before, and I think the Immunovant will continue to talk about it as well. We view that market as large and interesting. We view the evidence for FcRn modulation being effective is obviously robust at this point across multiple programs. And we think that the specific trial design that Immunovant is employing there with induction and maintenance and rescue therapy. And with all the flexibility that comes from the subcutaneous administration from the trial design, allowing docs to move patients between doses at various times and randomizing across different doses is going to give us a really differentiated profile relative to any of the other FcRns in development. And obviously, the details of those programs, including the label on VivGuard [ph] is well known and frankly, doesn't have the same level of flexibility.
So I think we feel a big opportunity in MG for a differentiated program. And we think we've got a development strategy. And frankly, maybe this is another important point. We have the ability to suppress IgG. We think deeper than roughly, we believe any of the other anti-FcRn antibodies in development will do. That's a combination of the actual molecule and the way we're developing it. And look, we think that has the potential to drive maximum overall efficacy in addition to the flexibility of the treatment paradigm. So we think we have a chance to win competitively on multiple axes there. And we think estrinclass [ph] is going to matter a ton to those patients.
And then finally, on cash runway. I'll reiterate we have over 2 years of runway, we try and generally run our business to be confident in over 2 years of runway visibility. It's easy for us to do that because we have a very broad portfolio with lots of pushes and pulls. And we have over 2 years of runway, assuming everything succeeds, we move a whole bunch of discovery programs forward. So there's a lot of flexibility as things evolve to modulate that. We just feel really lucky to be in the capital position that we're in.
We think in terms of polls and sort of the obvious things of [indiscernible] event programs, those are all expensive. But in terms of pushes and I mentioned this at the beginning of the call, and I think it's a really important point. We have a lot of flexibility for sources of capital that go beyond the capital markets.
Obviously, we're watching the capital markets closely, but we have a number of other opportunities, partnerships obviously, Genevant monetization of stakes, just a number of tools to allow us to modulate our cash balance even outside of the capital market. So we feel, as I said, very privileged both about our business model, and about our and about our cash balance capability there. So yes, appreciate the question. It's a good question on the current market for sure. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So for the Proteovant partnership with Pfizer, I believe there were actually two assets as part of that deal. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the second asset and kind of thoughts on that?
And then on the updates on the LNP patent litigation, I guess, any update that you can give in terms of timing for when we could hear the court's decision on the motion of business would be great. Thanks. Sure. So the other asset in the Pfizer partnership was a selective TYK2 with its own unique signature. We wanted to use this call to focus on repo, given the fact that the lead molecule is already in registrational studies. We don't have claims to shed right now for brepocitinib, which is that selective to TYK2. We're more focused on the combination.
I'm sorry. And then on the IP question that you asked, I don't think we have a specific comment on the court's time line for response there. I think it's ultimately up to the court. I don't think there's a prescribed time line for it. So they have the discretion to decide when they want to. So we're watching for it in the coming months is what I would say. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks, Neena. Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks very much. And I wanted to add my congrats on the submarine Pfizer transaction. So my questions are as follows. First, could you talk about the expected payer access ramp for tapinarof? And then how we, as investors, should think about net sales in coming quarters since it's going to take a while for payer access to actually take hold.
Then second, with respect to court action on the LNP litigation ahead, could you just talk about potential timing and how we should think about developments to watch?
And third, I don't know if Richard is on the call, but would be helpful to understand how we should be thinking about cash flow in the upcoming fiscal year, specifically operating cash flow or operating cash burn, I mean? Thank you. Thanks, Dave. Those are all great questions. I appreciate it. On tapinarof, payer ramp, I think we've commented a little bit in response to some of the other questions here. We've said our main focus is on high-quality coverage. What that means is we're prepared to do the work to get the covered claims through to get payers to pay attentions of the program, and that's what we're doing now. So we are most focused on, as I think we've said a few times, script volume during this period of initial launch and expect that to last for a little while here. And then what we said is that we expect to have that coverage online kind of in the 12 to 18 months time line, and that's when we would expect gross to net to - to ramp up and normalize.
And I would say we'll be prepared to provide sort of better specific guidance on what we think normal gross to net will look like for us once we have a little more visibility into those contracts and so on. So I think stay tuned on that topic.
Then on the LNP litigation, I think a similar answer to the prior question here. I think the District Court has discretion on when they respond. And sort of the next major action there is the District Court response to [indiscernible] motion to dismiss or had some discretion there. But in general, they tend to respond within months. So that's something to specifically watch out for.
We think the acute to situation is of less direct interest, but that's obviously also ongoing, and we'll get some feedback from the court there. And then beyond that, I don't have a lot to comment on right now or on any other possible movement there, but those are the things we're watching most closely.
And then Richard is on, so I can hand it over to him for any additional comments on operating cash flow. But I think while we haven't given a specific sort of cash flow statement metric guidance, I think you can look at where things have been and you can look at the sort of runway guidance that we're giving overall and back in a little bit to kind of what we think things are going to look like from an operating cash flow perspective. Richard, I don't know if there's anything you would add to that? Thanks for the question. Look, we haven't provided guidance for the year specifically, but I'm very pleased with a lot of the reputation we've done this quarter. And as we think about the portfolio, I think we have a really high bar here as we move things forward, we'll have data emerging from us from competitors, and we'll put the same laser-focused lens on taking additional programs forward to data mergers from our programs and externally.
And certainly, as we ramp up the VTAMA launch and the 80 data [ph] comes through, you can think about some of the additional spend for launch down the line. And then as we said, for Dermavant [ph] we have the additional Phase III trials that will be coming through that you'll see kind of by the end of the year and some of the other savings that we've talked about should confidently lend us the 2-plus year runway, but we're not providing 1 year guidance. Thank you very much. Thanks, Dave. Our next question comes from Sal [ph] with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just Matt, maybe to start, I know you highlighted that you've gotten some positive feedback on Vitoma [ph] in the early days. I'm just curious, when we think about the sort of selling points that you've had for [indiscernible], is there anything in particular that is resonating with physicians or sort of really standing out to them in the early conversations? Yes. So in the last couple of weeks, we've acted on speaker trainings. We've been out to sort of top thought leaders on psoriasis, I think in general, what are we getting. People were excited about the bit of data. Obviously, that's something we expected.
I'd say the cosmetic elegance of the stream itself as the kind of thing that people can tell immediately on use. I say we've gotten good feedback on that and on tolerability right out of the gate.
It mostly confirms the survey data that we've previously shared. And we're excited to see that patients want to use the end. And then the other, I'd say early indications from the field onset of action benefit - benefit. I think these are the kinds of things that we were expecting in early launch, but we're pretty encouraged by it. Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, and I might have missed it. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the origins of the brepo transaction with Pfizer. Was this an asset that you would identify and reached out to them? Or did they reach out to you to discuss it? I will hand over the origin story to Mayukh. Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think that you should assume that, look, I think we have a great working group with Pfizer. We have great work in life with all the pharma companies as well, and it's almost more of an ongoing dialogue than an outreach or a specific outreach in either direction.
But this is obviously a striking, I think, really unique drug that I think we had seen their data evolve and emerge for a period of time. And we're excited that we're able to kind of have a win-win collaboration and we're just getting started. And I guess just maybe Matt, final question on Beta when you think about sort of prioritization, obviously, you're starting in dermatitis and Lupus. I'm just curious how are you thinking that some of the bigger indications that we already have some proof of concept data on or sort of some early clinical data are those worth pursuing or something that you think about down the road? Yes, thanks. It's a good question. And obviously, the data that we have are highly compelling across a range of indications. I think they highlight just how strong a molecule it is. I think right now, we're focused on the development strategy that we've laid out here, not just in these indications, but frankly, in other indications that Rhine [ph] with means, and we think there are many.
And so I'd say that's our initial focus, and I think you can expect to sort of continue to pursue that line at we're walking the yield closely and looking forward to continuing to provide up group as we get going. We think we can - we can generate yes, that's perfect. And I guess, Matt, is pain should we think about this as sort of an asset similar to what we've seen with batoclimab in terms of just the rollout of new indications? Or do you think that these two are going to be the ones that we should focus on for some amount of time? I think you should focus on these two but you should expect us to continue to announce some further opportunities as they crystallize. Obviously, it's a competitive area. So like batoclimab, we're focused on making our decisions executing on them and talking about them in the right order.
But I think you should expect us to continue to face - look, we think that they should work in indications - a variety of indications of high morbidity and mortality with few approved therapy therapies, and we're looking at areas where there's highly inflammatory pathobiologies where specifically do inhibition in TYK2 and JAK1would we expect to provide greater efficacy than either alone. And we think there's multiple to choose from in addition to the two that we've mentioned today. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Yeah, good morning. You highlighted at the end there that you have this increasingly broad immunology portfolio. And of course, these are across different bands. So I'm curious. Could you talk about any potential synergies across the set of bands, whether that's an area we should expect you to continue to focus on as you expand the portfolio? Yes. Thanks. It's a good question. I appreciate you listening. I would say a couple of things. First of all, we continue to not want to pigeonhole ourselves through specific therapeutic areas. So I think you'll continue to see us taking opportunities more broadly than just immunology.
There are obvious benefits to having a concentration or some elevated expertise in an area. I think we see it in our diligence. We see it in our track record in people's understanding of our ability to execute these kinds of deals and these kinds of programs.
Ultimately, if there are overlaps in commercial sort of footprint, we have the ability to do interesting things through the family and working with management teams to maximize sort of synergistic value, but we also have the flexibility to treat the programs as separate.
So I would say we get benefit from talent mobility. We get benefit from leadership. We get benefit from sharing ideas across the family. And I think down the line as we get closer to commercial in some of these programs, we have the ability to think creatively about collaborations and the flexibility to do what makes sense across the family.
And I'll highlight one of the things in particular, which is talent mobility. We talked about deprioritizing some programs today. I think one of the great things about the Roivant model is that we have the ability to take - to offer top talent from - from [indiscernible] programs that we do prioritize opportunities in other places around the organization, and that's something that's always been core to our model, and it's something that a concentration in human therapeutic area makes it even easier. And so I think it's something we're excited to have. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm currently showing any questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Matthew Gline for closing remarks. Great. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to all who are listening today. Appreciate all of the really good questions. Obviously, an exciting combination of announcements for us. So yeah, looking forward to continuing to provide updates over time. Thank you for listening. And have a good summer. We'll be back out on a call like this in a couple of months. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Paul Davis, Head of Communication. Please go ahead. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss Roivant's financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. I'm Paul Davis, Head of Communications at Roivant. Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer. For those dialing in via conference call you can find the slide being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I would like to remind you that we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation that reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our products and product candidates. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC, including the earnings release and Form 10-Q filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties. We'll begin with Matt Gline, who will review key business updates across Roivant in advance, and provide a financial update. We'll end the call with a Q&A session.
With that, I'll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Today's call will be a little bit shorter than usual because we last got together about six weeks ago, when we presented our year-end results.
So I'll begin on Page 4 and I'll take you through some of the key highlights of the business today and then we'll make some time Q&A. So as a reminder, we're excited about where we are at the end of our first quarter this year, with obviously a number of important attributes, including the ongoing commercial launch of VTAMA, which we will spend a little bit of time on this morning, that is backed by a broad clinical stage pipeline, including multiple pivotal and registrational study is currently ongoing.
Our chip-to-clinic discovery program, including our proprietary QUAISAR platform that we are using to bolster that pipeline at the discovery stage, a number of sources of asymmetric potential upside, including our Genevant IP portfolio. And all of that supported by what continues to be a strong capital position with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which enables us to finance and develop all of our programs across our pipeline.
So I'll start on Page 5 with a brief update on the VTAMA launch. And I'll say, first of all, I'm incredibly pleased with the very early information here. Obviously, as we've said on a number of occasions, we are principally tracking prescriptions at this time and we feel script volume has been robust in the early days of the launch. Obviously, it is still the early days. We're only a couple months in, but we feel the script volume and the early feedback from providers has been very, very strong.
There are a few key updates in recent weeks around this launch. The first is that our LTE data, our long-term extension study data has been published in JAAD and that highlights the 130 day remittive effect off-therapy for patients achieving a PGA of zero on VTAMA that's something that we've talked about a fair amount before and it's something we think is an important differentiating attribute of the drug.
We also have noted that our Japanese partner reported positive Phase 3 data for tapinarof in atopic dermatitis, including statistically significant results in IGA and EASI, with plans to file that for approval in Japan. And finally, our own Phase 3 study in atopic dermatitis is expected in the first half of next year, which would extend our market to potentially $15 million annual topical prescriptions. And then this is from the data, we're excited to know that we've become the number one most prescribed branded topical for psoriasis as of eight weeks into our launch.
So on Page 6, I'll note, again from a script volume perspective, we are excited about how we are performing relative to other topical launches that we've seen in psoriasis. You can see a number of those launches in the solid lines here and we feel proud of our early performance. I think it's reflective of the enthusiasm around VTAMA. We also feel excited about the fact we are approximately keeping pace without OPZELURA, that's the dash line on the slide, which is obviously in atopic dermatitis, a market about 4 times as large from a prescription perspective as psoriasis. So again, early days, but an exciting indicator for us.
And just as a reminder, we really are principally focused on prescription volume at this time. The quarter here is only for the really one month or about a month of launch data for VTAMA. So the revenues are not significant, but we're focused on prescription data as we work through our coverage and contracting. And as we said, it will be about 12 months to 18 months before we expect those contracts to be in place.
On Page 7, I just want to remind people of a few key attributes around VTAMA and the attributes that we think will support our blockbuster potential in both in psoriasis and potentially ultimately an atopic dermatitis. We have the efficacy and durability that we need and maybe most importantly we have this off-treatment remittive benefit that we've talked about a fair amount.
We have a broad target population with a label that is used across the entire psoriasis disease spectrum from mild to moderate to severe. We have no warnings or precautions at all, nor do we have any restrictions or notes about concomitant medications on our label. We're labeled for use on all areas of the body and notably that includes in our intertriginous areas. And something we've talked a little bit less about that I'll remind everyone on this call, we have statistically significant improvement in itch as early as week two in our strategy data.
So on Slide 8, I put that itch data in the presentation so that we can just look at or remind us of the data. You can see the data across the two studies here. And one thing I'd like to call your attention to is that we saw a statistically significant separation from vehicle on impact on itch as early as week two in our studies.
You can see those P values on the slide. And notably this comports with some of the early feedback we're getting from prescribers and patients, which is to say that overall, I would say one of the early attributes that we're hearing is that the drug is working faster than people expected and we're obviously pleased to hear that from the field.
So I'll close on VTAMA on Slide 9, just to update our differentiation profile versus the field for psoriasis. Obviously, one of the main updates here is that ZORYVE was approved recently and so we've updated this chart accordingly. And you can see, we feel we have a truly differentiated profile. We are among the only topicals to have an on label remittive benefit.
We continue to be pleased with the fact that we have no duration limitations, no body surface limitations, including no limitation against in the intertriginous regions. We have no safety or safety warnings or precaution section on our label and then we have no label drug interactions and no contraindications as well, which is something that's differentiated versus some of our competitors.
So with that, I'll move on from VTAMA. I'm sure we'll touch on it in the Q&A section as well. And I'll talk a little bit if you jump forward to Slide 11, about where we are from a clinical perspective with all programs backing that up. We're showing here a subset of our pipeline. We're focusing on some of the most important and latest stage programs. Notably including our VTAMA study in atopic dermatitis that I mentioned before.
We also have now begun our Phase 3 program and Brepocitinib Dermatomyositis and we have our ongoing program and Brepocitinib lupus that I'll talk about in a moment that's going to enroll as last patient any day now? And then, Brepocitinib, there have been a number of updates that we have put out recently, including the fact that multiple of their pivotal trials are initiated and indications that we think could be blockbuster indications for Brepocitinib. So we're looking forward sharing more about that generally as those programs progress.
You can see on Slide 12, some of the sort of features of our current clinical positioning, including the fact that by the end of this year we will have seven trials, including four pivotal trials ongoing, with multiple -- with progress across multiple fronts, I won't talk about each of the individual studies here. And we expect three additional or more additional initiations of programs in 2022, notably including that we've already initiated, as I mentioned, the programs in Brepocitinib Myasthenia Gravis, we expect to be initiating Thyroid Eye Disease imminently.
The last thing I want to do on this call before I turn it over to Q&A is we went through the most recent addition to our pipeline, brepocitinib with Priovant last quarter of the year end call earlier this summer. But I just want to reiterate some of the features of that program because it's a program that we're very excited about in our late portfolio and because as I mentioned before, we are expecting the final patients to enroll in our lupus study any day now and we think that'll be an important catalyst for us next year and so we wanted to continue to draw attention to that programs.
So Brepocitinib overall as a reminder is a unique dual targeted first in class TYK2 and JAK1 inhibitor, which we're developing for a variety of specialty autoimmune diseases. We think that dual inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 is scientifically important because we think it will potentially provide greater efficacy than agents that inhibit either one alone, in inflammatory autoimmune disease where both pathways are relevant and where the interaction between the pathways is relevant.
We have extremely robust -- as a reminder, this program won licensing from Pfizer and announced in the last call, we have extremely robust clinical data, statistically significant clinically meaningful benefits in five placebo controlled studies demonstrated to date in our oral formulation, including exposure of over 1,000 subjects with a safety profile consistent with approved JAK inhibitors.
We have -- we think a distinctive strategy to develop the program, including development in a series of uncrowded orphan and specialty autoimmune diseases, where there's high morbidity and mortality, where there's high unmet need and where we think the science of our drug, the dual inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 will contribute directly to efficacy.
We have two ongoing registrational programs, including a single registrational Phase 3 study in dermatomyositis that we've already initiated as well as a large global Phase 2b study of lupus that's expected to complete enrollment this month with data expected in the second half of next year and that's designed to serve as one of two registrational studies in that indication. And then finally, we have strong intellectual property protection.
So on Slide 14, I don't think I need to remind people in great detail, but SLE is an important disease with obviously many, many patients up to 300,000 people in the United States affected by it. And there's significant unmet need and obviously a disruptive and difficult clinical presentation. There are not very many approved therapies that work well and those therapies are commercially successful and provide important benefit to patients, but with significant move beyond.
On Page 15, a reminder of a little bit of the rationale that we have for why we think this drug will be exciting in SLE. And that's first of all, there is data from a number of JAK1 or TYK2 inhibitors in SLE and in both case is we see signs of efficacy, but with significant room with improvement. So you could see on this slide, the placebo adjusted response week 24 on the left hand side from a Phase 2 study of Baricitinib in SLE and you can see a nice response there as well as the Phase 2 study on the right of Deucravacitinib, a TYK2 inhibitor in SLE. And again, you can see a nice response there, but there's obviously significant room across both of these for improved overall efficacy. And again, we think that we have the opportunity with Brepocitinib to improve on both of them.
One of the rationales for that, one of the reasons we think we may be able to do well on Page 16 is there are a number of existing indications where we have data in both Brepocitinib and either deucravacitinib and baricitinib or both. And you can see that data shown here we are not currently prosecuting any of these indications of Brepocitinib, but to give you a sense of just how significant our efficacy has been across multiple studies with the drug. And that makes us excited for what we expect we might be able to see in this SLE study.
So you can see on Slide 17, the design of that study, as I said, we're expecting our last patient to enroll any day now and it's a 52-week study with a couple of different dose arms and so you can see all of that on Page 17.
So with that, I'll wrap up on some of the specific updates. I'll note on the next slide, Slide 18, just we are having and we've announced our Annual Roivant Investor Day will be on Wednesday, September 28, at 11 a.m. So more details to come about that and we're excited to hear from many of you then and we're excited to share a number of key updates around the business, including R&D updates and others at that event.
So I'll close and obviously, the market continues to gyrate, but even with some little green shoots. Just to say, we are extremely privileged from a capital position perspective. If you jump forward to Page 20. I was pointing out some of the key financial items for the quarter. So we have R&D expense of $136 million or adjusted R&D non-GAAP of $123 million. SG&A of $149 million or adjusted non-GAAP of $88 million. For a total adjusted net loss of $354 million or an adjusted net loss of $211 million.
Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash stayed at about $2 billion for the quarter, which we think is important for being able to support our activities. We have balance sheet debt of approximately $417 million which only $33 million is sort of a standard credit facility with the carrying value of $33 million and then the remainder are milestone or fair value of royalty obligations related to VTAMA. And then we have 703,625,000 common shares issued and outstanding as of Friday.
So finally on Slide 21, I'll just remind everybody, this is an incredibly catalyst rich period for our business. We've obviously regular ongoing updates on VTAMA, as well as new mid and late stage in licensing that's ongoing currently and then excited to provide updates on – we’ll continue to provide updates on our LNP patent litigation at Genevant as we have them, and continue to provide updates on QUAISAR on our degrader discovery efforts as we have them as well.
In addition to that, we'll be initiating multiple pivotal programs, I've mentioned some of these on this call. We'll get topline data from a number of pivotal programs within the next 12 to 15, 18 months between VTAMA and Brepocitinib. We expect potential data from RVT-2001 in our Phase 1/2 trial, low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome next year and we continue to work towards data on other programs as well. So an exciting period of execution for us. Looking forward to connecting with everybody on our Investor Day and looking forward to continue to track many of these things, including the VTAMA launch in the weeks and months to come.
So with that, I'll conclude my remarks for the day and I'll open the line for Q&A and hand it back to the operator. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you very much and thank you for the updates. So I have a few questions. First, could you talk about the expected ramp of VTAMA going forward, particularly in the face of competitive dynamics? Second, could you discuss how you're thinking about gross to net over the next couple of years, particularly relative to Street expectations and what you're seeing from the sell-side? And then third, could you comment on the cash burn in the quarter and remind us about your cash runway? Thank you very much. Thanks, Dave. Thank you for all those questions, they're all good questions and I'm happy to take them. So I appreciate it. I'll start with VTAMA question, which is, early in the launch to make long term projections on a ramp. We are pleased with the early prescription data and we think it sets us up well. We're pleased with the engagement we had with patients and physicians and with some of the early feedback we're getting on the drug. So all of that reads well.
You asked about competitive dynamics, the first thing I'll say, which I think is an important point that we're just going to reiterate over and over again is, we don't view this as a competitive market versus other novel agents first and foremost. We view it as a competitive market versus corticosteroids, where there are literally millions of people on corticosteroids for psoriasis or literally millions of prescriptions for corticosteroids and psoriasis. And we think we have better efficacy and better tolerability that should allow us to take significant share from that whole category of agents, which is currently the standard of care mainline therapies. So that's the first thing I'd say.
As far as the competitive landscape is concerned, yeah, I think there's a -- we obviously have a new topical competitor now on the market in ZORYVE. It's a drug that has some nice attributes. We think we are differentiated meaningfully between our remittive benefit and our overall more simple safety picture without contraindications or restrictions on concomitant meds. That's why we also think more voice share in novel topicals for psoriasis is helpful. We think there will be a little bit of a rising tide effect overall.
So I would say given the population that we're going after, I'm excited about our ramp and I'm not too concerned a competitive perspective. And I think as you see some new impressive systemic agents coming, I think it will be even more important to folks like payers to have a real off ramp, to have a real opportunity for people to stay on topical therapy versus moving to some of these, what I expect with very expensive systemic agents or new biologics. So I think that will also provide a good opportunity for us in the marketplace.
Second, on gross to net dynamics and sales expectations. I guess it's a great question. It's an important topic. Just to be very clear about it, our expectation is that our gross to nets will be -- or gross to net yields will be low for the next while here, we've said 12 months to 18 months to commercial contracts. I think as far as Street numbers or consensus, I won't comment specifically, but I'll just say it’s important for us to say over and over again.
We think gross to net yields are going to be low during the period when we're contracts in place and we think they'll normalize only after we have those commercial contracts in place and payers are converted from uncovered. And that's a function we've talked about this before. It's a function of things like the new to market blocks that make it difficult until those contracts are in place.
We are learning every day from the marketplace, including looking at formulary positioning for couple of people that have gotten for us and watching what that looks like. And we're just excited to see where those discussions shape out and we'll provide an update on contracts when we had it.
And then, the last question on burn and runway. I think we've said this before, but it's an important point. We always look to run the business with about two years of runway or I should say visibility into about two years of runway. We have a pretty broad portfolio, so it's very easy for us to optimize to extend our runway, to manage our runway.
And so I'll say we continue to run the business. With that in mind, we have lots of options to extend runway including partnerships delaying or terminating lower priority programs, et cetera., as well as monetizing stakes across that portfolio, things like Datavant that doesn't depend holding that we're constantly looking for opportunities around. So we are excited about that.
I'd say you may see some swings in our sort of working capital over the last couple of quarters or next quarter just as to finer (ph) off royalty financing works its way through. But I don't think that's going to have any meaningful effect on long-term burn. So thanks, Dave. I think that covers the three questions there. Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dennis Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. First on VTAMA (ph), can you please give some more granularity on the launch, in terms of who and where it's being prescribed? Are you seeing it from mild and moderate? And maybe talk about how penetrated are those accounts that you guys are currently in? And then secondly, perhaps on Proteovant, you guys mentioned that you had an AR [Technical Difficulty] that is and when can we expect the mix? Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you, Dennis. That's both good questions. So I'll start on the VITAMA question. We've seen, I think, we mentioned in the Slide 6, 3,000 people write VTAMA prescriptions. We've been focused early on the sort of highest prescribing docs, the docs who write a significant percentage of topical prescriptions and who are the general thought leaders on novel topical agents. We've seen multiple -- many docs have written multiple prescriptions and obviously there's some concentration there. And then there's a whole population of doctors even in that high prescribing population that we're still getting out to and still getting our best readout too. So I think there's a lot of room to run there.
We have not sort of focused on a specific severity band within those docs. And so we don't have a specific strategy as far as these severity or sub-setting the patient population. I would say, we get reports in the field from a variety of different patient populations, including mild patients who didn't like being on steroids, but also including reports from severe psoriasis patients who, for example, were on the cusp of using a systemic agent and have been pleased with their VTAMA experience in ways that may forestall (ph) that for them. So it's been a pretty broad, a pretty broad patient population and a lot of interest in the drug from across the spectrum. Again, we're pleased with both the number of prescriptions and the number of unique prescribers.
And then your second question was around the androgen receptor degrader. I think we're still looking at that program both our data that we're sort of getting the final wisps of, in our competitor data and to be honest, it's the kind of program that we're watching closely in the context of the recent drug pricing legislation. So I would say, the bar for that is high and we're still sort of evaluating our options there and we'll provide an update when we've got one. But I appreciate the question. Thank you, Dennis. Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more, Matt you just mentioned that you are seeing some docs write multiple prescriptions. If you could talk a little bit more about just the general prescriber behavior you're seeing. Are you seeing docs generally prescribed to maybe one to two patients first, see how things go with those patients and then kind of opening up their broader population of patients? And then also any initial kind of feedback or anything you're hearing on folliculitis? That'd be great. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Neena. So those are both -- it's a great question overall and both parts that are good. I don't -- we don't have specific data to share right now on whether docs are kind of dribbling out or not. I would say anecdotally, we have a pretty wide variety of prescriber behaviors from fruit believers who -- we’re shooting out of the gate and continuing to shoot to facts who have become more and more enthusiastic about the drug as they've had positive patients experience. I think I mentioned we continue to get lots of positive reports from vaccine patients in the field.
I would say one attribute that's coming back that we saw in our data, but think it's been exciting to hear in the real world has been the onset of efficacy. I think patients are pleased with how fast they're seeing results and then another set of reports that we're seeing, which I mentioned are from patients who were sort of on their last guess as far as tacticals were concerned and we're sort of evaluating progression to systemic agents. And I think it's been a real breath of fresh air for that patient population. So we've heard positive reports from docs and patients about that from both.
On folliculitis, I'll just say, I think it's as we predicted, we have not heard any significant rumblings about it. It's not something that we think is meaningfully affecting the way docs use the drug or meaningfully affecting the patient experience given that it's transient and on target for the drug. So nothing new or significant around folliculitis that we think is affecting commercial behavior. Thank you, Neena. Thanks for listening. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a few for you. First one I wanted to ask about was Brepocitinib and the SLE market landscape and how you think about that for your product? And also why you chose this one in dermatomyositis as the first two indications? And then secondly, on the Japan Tobacco, congratulations on that news. If you could be more specific on the feedback or the read through to your AD study, that would be very helpful? Thank you. And then last one, I wanted to ask you was broadly what is the physician feedback on VTAMA and how they view it as an addition to the market here with one of the first topicals being approved, novel topicals in a long time. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Louise. All really good questions and appreciate them all. So thanks for listening. On the first on Brepocitinib with SLE. SLE, as you know from covering the field is that littered with lots of people who've tried lots of things. The competitive landscape is really there's two approved biologics with lots of unresponsive patients and many others who experience a partial response. So it's a disease that has been historically stymied (ph) by a combination of agents that haven't worked as well as they could other than just for development execution. So we see a huge opportunity for a novel agent.
And we talked about this a little bit on our annual call and maybe some of the slides there are useful to refer to as you're looking back on it. But I think there's good scientific rationale for the combination of TYK2 and JAK1 being important in lupus. And we've seen the recent data from the Brepocitinib (ph) on the Phase 2 side, which Baricitinib on the deck one side, we'll put that data in this deck. So we think we have a real opportunity there. And as we mentioned last time, this is a study that we're running together with Pfizer and it's going to a capital efficient program for us with a readout next year. So we see it as an opportunity.
As far as why, we've chosen these indications. I'd say one of these are both diseases with a high morbidity and mortality with no approved oral therapies at all. As I said in the case, lupus the approved therapies of biologics. And so no approved oral therapy side of getting mortality. And then maybe most importantly, from a scientific perspective, we're looking at diseases where we think the biology of both TYK2 and JAK1 are relevant and potentially where we're going to see some synergistic effect between TYK2 and JAK1 that will make us better than even a combination of independent JAK1 or TYK2 agents might seem to be based on their data. So I'd say those are our main indications, [Technical Difficulty] lupus erythematosus, reflect that. So that's on Brepo thanks for that question.
On AD (ph), thanks -- thank you for taking note of it. It's obviously we're excited to see it. It's always good to see I'll pass readout and thank you for taking note of it. It's obviously we're excited to see it. It's always good to see. If I spread out one of your programs, especially in indication where you're currently running a study. And I'll note that that study is significantly smaller than our Phase 3 studies.
So to see statistically significant results in the two key endpoints there in a smaller study and to know that they're carrying the program forward through registration is obviously all great and feels like good read through for us. Ultimately, they're going to publish their data, but we're looking forward to our own data. when -- and we think our data is going to readout before they make theirs publicly available. So yeah, I think it's a good positive read through on our efficacy in AD.
And then finally, physician feedback. So we've gotten a couple different versions of this question this morning and I'm always happy to take it because I've been incredibly pleased with the quality of the physician feedback. I think -- look, I think docs were hungry for an effective novel topical agent. I think patients were hungry for an effective novel topical agent. I think some of what we are seeing in the physician feedback is just generally that outcome, the doctor excited to have something new prescribe and patients are excited to have something new and nonsteroidal to go on.
I think some of the feedback we're getting is frankly just specific to our agents. In terms of the feedback on the onset of efficacy is being fast. In terms of the feedback on it's obviously early for us to be seeing the sort of “remittive” benefit. But early feedback that is through consistent with that idea. And so I think it's been a really positive experience for docs and patients so far from what we can tell.
And makes us excited for what's to come. Obviously, there's a lot of work to do to build that into the size of market opportunity that we think deserves to be. And we think it's going to be really topical and psoriasis are going to be a really big opportunity and we think VTAMA is going to be a really important drug sort of best in class drug in that category. So early feedback if positive more excited, generally more of it. Thank you. Thank you, Louise. Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Douglas Tsao with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just Matt, maybe just as a quick follow-up to Louise question on the VTAMA readout. In Japan just to confirm, the -- those two studies have the -- or that study had the same primary endpoint as the study that you were -- that you're currently running an atopic dermatitis, correct? Yes. Primary and key secondary were IGA and EASI, which are also important endpoints for us, exactly. That's correct. Yes. I just wanted to confirm because that sort of obviously highlights read-through, should be very strong. And then also just when you think about the progress and just curious in terms of the early phase feedback that you've been getting from payers in terms of getting contracts into place and how they're thinking about sort of prior authorizations and where they see this being put into the treatment paradigm? Because obviously to your point, it could represent an attractive opportunities and off ramp for more expensive biologics. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate that question. It's a good one. Obviously, those are all active discussions. It's hard to comment on specifics of where they are. But I think the point you highlighted is obviously an important point to everybody and hadn't been lost on anybody that it's important to have an off rent before biologics. And I think we've said before our view on the treatment landscape is that we should be mainstay of therapy, which is important so not just a sort of a pre biologics option, but really as the baseline of care and that's just sort of where we think the drug deserves to be positioned. But we think obviously the factors around biologics will help us in getting the positioning we want.
The second thing, I just remind people of is remember that the main things that insurance companies care about, the payers care about in determining coverage is demand. Obviously, the scientific attributes of the product is something they look at carefully in the FX per panels, but the way that sort of gets realized is around commercial demand. And so the early script volume that we're seeing here is incredibly important we think ensuring that we have the kind of credible broad coverage that we want.
And then we talked a fair amount in the approval call about our pricing strategy and about making sure that we had both the price points that will be attractive to list price sensitive payers, but also importantly a price that offered us the opportunity to offer significant rebates to those PBMs that are rebate sensitive. So I think all of those dynamics are important and we think they're going to matter. And you're actually right, the biologics are really big pain points for payers right now. So they're all going to be very focused on defraying that spend over time. And then just one quick follow-up. I mean, how do you envision obviously getting contracts in place for psoriasis? How long do you think it will take when you look to add the atopic dermatitis indication. Should -- do you think that should be come in place fairly quickly soon after that approval? Yeah. I think once the AD indication is approved, we should see adoption in AD relatively quickly. In terms of the specifics around payer contracting and payer dynamics, I think once we have the psoriasis payer contracts in place and once we have the AD data, we'll be able to comment more specifically on that timeline. But I think it's fair to say that we expect uptake in AD to be relatively quick on approval. Okay, great. Thank you so much, Matt. Congrats on the progress. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Good morning. Two for me. First on the folliculitis (ph), you mentioned that you're not seeing much of an impact, but is that something you're having to educate physicians bond or is that some people seem to kind of understand from the get go? And then with respect to the script accelerate, what are you seeing there? And how do you think that $75 patient copay or responsibility is impacting this still right? Yes. So Thanks, Corinne. Those are both good and important questions. Yes. On folliculitis, dermatologists are very familiar with folliculitis as condition. And that's all dermatologists are pretty familiar with the folliculitis conditions. So there's not a lot of education need to sort of explain what it is. I think it's important that they have the heads up about it. To be honest, we're just not hearing a lot about it in the field, which I think is exactly what we want.
It's something that I think the docs are comfortable with, but also the patient experience of it is my old, it's transient. I suspect that we'll be hearing more about it as many patients were asking their doctors about it after experiencing it. So I think in general, it's just not having much read through on patient or prescriber behavior is sort of, how I understand the current situation to be based on the feedback that we do have.
And then, so we're not sharing specific fill rates, but I think we're extremely pleased with the overall rate of that fill prescriptions. And I think that reflects the attributes of the product, it reflects the sales and marketing strategy and it obviously reflects the impact of the copay card program in all of its features in terms of getting patients on drug. And we talked a little bit about how the way that our copay card disruption is also designed to help us in the coverage process and so we're continuing to follow that as well. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Corinne. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks for taking the question. First on VTAMA, I just wanted to ask about the Japanese AD study. I guess looking at the baseline demographics there and maybe the enrollment criteria, would you say that's fairly reflective of the U.S. study and maybe what you can expect to there? And then on Brepocitinib, kind of building off one of the earlier questions. Can you maybe just tell us where you see the bar is for you on the Phase 2 study for next year given some of the competition? I know and you also mentioned that your drugs you think would be potentially better than even dual administration of separate inhibitors. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on why that would be the case? Thanks very much. Perfect. So on VTAMA, the answer is, the studies criteria are similar. Patient populations are different only in the sense that the study in Japan was obviously exclusively Japanese patients. I think the read through is positive and then just a reminder that study is significantly smaller. I think overall that study is smaller than either of our individual Phase 3 studies in AD. So I think that's an important part of that read through there.
And then I think your second question was on sort of Brepo and what do we think is the bar, we've talked a little bit about what the unmet need looks like there. I think candidly the bar has to be pretty high. We want to see superior SRI-4 to the approved therapies and then good data on secondary endpoints. So I think the bar for efficacy is reasonably high for the program. It would be sort of one of the only oral agents, actually they'll currently approve oral agents. So we think we have a pretty good opportunity there. Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Nishant Gandhi with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Hi. This is Alex on Truist Securities. Going back to the conversations with payers on formulary position, have the discussions been challenged at all of the launches ZORYVE and the price point that the competitor has chosen that modified the ongoing negotiations at all with the payers that you're seeing. And then also can you remind us, are you monitoring for how many tubes per month that patients use for VTAMA in real world practice? And if you do, are you going to present this data to investors and what time and future might that be? Thanks. Yes, thanks. Those are both good questions about VTAMA launch. Thank you. Appreciate them. Yes, on the [indiscernible] price point. I guess a couple of comments. One is we're not going to comment on active discussions with payers and our tubes was just approved a couple of weeks ago. So I don't think there's a real kind of update on the impact anyway. I think we've talked a fair amount in our approval meeting about why we were pricing, where we were pricing.
And our tube (ph) has been guiding to their pricing strategy for some time. I think for us it was about threading the needle between a low enough list price to appeal to those plans that we're going to focus on list price, but also high enough list price to be able to offer the kinds of rebates to the PBMs where so much of the commercial volume lies. And I think we feel good about our pricing strategy considering everything that went into it. So, I won't -- again, comes from an acute pricing strategy directly, but I feel good about ours.
I also think we just have a differentiated product from ZORYVE. And I think the attributes of our product into these. And third, we have a remittive benefit that that we've talked a fair amount about. Their label has some features that we don't, including they have drug interactions listed with chip-384 (ph) metabolized drugs that's not a small thing. That's like Atorvastatin and Simvastatin and most contraceptives are included in their drug interaction profiles. So I think that's something that will potentially matter in practice.
And so I think there's various differentiating features that will also impact payer conversations that will also impact, we will also impact, -- where we are. And I think as I'd say, refills in general, maybe I'll say on the question about tubes per month, we don't currently provide guidance on that. It's super early obviously with many of our patients who just received the first prescription. I think refills are good indicators of happy patients and we're seeing already refills, some number of refills just a couple months in, which looks great to sign at least some patients are going to use multiple tubes, who's going to be happy on the drug.
So I think you should actually be able to track to some degrees at tube utilization from watching the NRx or CRx rate. I think we're happy with that. We continue to see good engagement in the [indiscernible] program as well. So I think overall it's too early to comparing long term conclusions on the refill rate or the number of tubes. But I think the early data is promising to us. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress. Thank you. At this time, I am showing no other questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the conference back to Matt Gline for closing remarks. Great. Thank you, operator. Thank you for everyone for your questions. Thank you everyone for listening this morning. As I said, it was a short call for the last one was just six weeks ago. We're looking forward to getting together in September for our Investor Day and continue to provide updates on VTAMA and on many other exciting things within our business over the months to come. So thank you everybody and we'll talk again soon. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeffrey Kalmus, Head of Strategic Finance. Please go ahead. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss Roivant's financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer.
For those dialing in via conference call you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I would like to remind you that we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation that reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our products and product candidates.
We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC, including the earnings release and Form 10-Q filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties.
We'll begin with Matt Gline, who will review key business updates across Roivant's events, and provide a financial update. We'll end the call with a Q&A session.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, everybody for joining this morning.
It's been a really impactful quarter for us and I'm excited to share some updates both from the quarter and more recent. Some of these updates we already shared last week as a consequence of the financing that we did, and some of them are new. And as I said, I look forward to sharing everything.
So we're going to cover a few topics. Notably, I'm going to start with a discussion on the launch of VTAMA and then we'll go through some clinical updates and some other updates around the business as well as the financial update at the end.
So I'm going to start on Slide 6 with just a -- an update on the VTAMA launch and really a reminder we are really, really pleased with how this launch is going. So you can see the script data here including for the quarter itself as well as for the more recent periods. And we continue to see great growth in scripts and we're very pleased with it.
We'll talk a little bit more about the revenue, but also excited to announce that we did $5 million in net product revenue for the quarter ending September 30, which is a 12% net yield, which given that all occurred prior to the signing of our PBM contract, again sort of a testament to the quality of our script to the number of docs who are willing to go through the prior authorization process.
So on Slide 7 one of the most important updates here is we have our first major PBM/payer contract signed. We indicated that would be coming before the end of the year, and we're very pleased that it was effective as of October 1. We haven't said which payer it's with, but most importantly, it gives us exactly the kind of coverage and access that we wanted, requiring only an automatic look back for steroid on the patient's chart. Or if the physician prefers an e-attestation of prior steroid use, which is a really easy bar to clear. So this is better than what we had initially hoped for in terms of the quality of coverage. And it ensures because close to 90% of psoriasis patients use a topical steroid as first line therapy. This gives us really access to all of the patients that we are focused on. And notably, as we said, we're focused on becoming the mainstay of therapy and ultimately supplanting steroids, which means, of course, the simplicity of access here is straightforward. And as a reminder as cons -- in this contract and our sort of copay card any covered claim that the pharmacy should have a $0 copay for the patients and so they should create a really positive experience for the patients covered here as well.
So on Slide 8, I'll also just remind everybody we're obviously pleased with how the launches going in absolute terms. We also -- we're pleased with how this looks relative to other psoriasis launches that we've observed. We became the number one most branded topical eight weeks into our launch, and we've comfortably stayed there since and we continue to keep pace with the launch of OPZELURA, which is notable because OPZELURA is atopic dermatitis and has about 4x as many scripts to draw from. We're now meaningfully over 50,000 prescriptions written, and we're over 6,000 by 6,400 unique prescribers since launch, so broad prescriber base and volumes that we're really happy with at this stage.
I want to talk a little bit on Slide 9 about the P&L. So we're still not giving explicit long-term gross to net guidance, but we've said since our Investor Day that we are confident we're going to get to a commercially attractive P&L. And I think you can see in some of the metrics on Slide 9, sort of why we had that confidence even before we knew what the sort of PBM contract looked like. We had $5 million in net product revenue, which for this stage in the launch we feel really good about and at 12% net yield; again, this is a clear demonstration of prescriber enthusiasm for the drug, given the sort of work required before that PBM contract to get medical exceptions during formulary review. So we're very pleased with these metrics and again, we expect to give steady state gross to net guidance after we've signed some additional PBM and payer contracts. But we expect to see this GTN yield improving from here as we execute on more of these contracts. We'll provide those updates as they come.
On Slide 10, I think is just an important point to hit. We're really pleased with how the launch has gone and certainly the sort of weekly script numbers. But I want to point out; we are really just getting started here. There are over 90,000 topical prescriptions in psoriasis alone, the vast majority of which are topical steroids. And there are over 320,000 topical prescriptions in atopic dermatitis, which will be a market accessible to us after we get our data and approval there. And our data is coming in the first half of next year. And so no matter how well things are going at this stage, this is a huge market to draw from. As we work to replace steroids as the topical steroids is the mainstay of care for these diseases. And notably, to get to a blockbuster product, we need like 5% to 10% share here so really modest relative to the quality of the product. So we've talked a little bit about sort of how the launch goes from here. And the one thing I'll say is, we have a lot of useful tools and levers to continue to drive adoption. And we're excited now that payer coverage is coming online to continue to build the script volume and to grow into what we believe should be an important multi-blockbuster product opportunities. So, excited to continue to share updates as we progress.
As important at this stage is the quantitative metrics, if you look on Slide 11, we've gotten just tremendous high quality feedback from early prescribers. We held on our Investor Day in September, a panel of KOLs, which I recommend listening to, if you haven't. And we got I think great to representative indications from prescribers on that panel, including great feedback on onset of action. We're seeing docs saying that their patients are telling them they're clearing as early as a couple of weeks into therapy. Docs understanding that this is really potentially a first line monotherapy topical treatment that cleans up the sort of use of steroids and the use of multiple steroids. And it's a real significant paradigm shift in how psoriasis patients can be managed. We've had great feedback on the feel of the cream itself and certainly have not heard any meaningful reports of tolerability issues that affect prescriber behavior. And yet just a huge amount of tremendous support for VTAMA from prescribers a really fantastic base to build from.
I want to highlight on Slide 12, an update that is relevant for our upcoming atopic dermatitis data, as well as just a good reminder on sort of the quality of the safety profile for VTAMA. We reported earlier last week, the results of our pediatric maximal use study in atopic dermatitis, and notably this included subjects, pediatric patients with a body surface area of atopic dermatitis up to 90% with a mean body surface area of 43%. So if you just picture what that literally means on a person, that's a remarkable body surface area to be treated with VTAMA. So we were using quite a lot of VTAMA on these patients and we saw a really favorable safety profile with a very low incidence of adverse events, no SAEs, a PK profile consistent with what we saw in the adult psoriasis population, and really minimal to no systemic exposure even under these sort of maximal use conditions. So we feel really good about the quality of this data and what it's going to mean for safety and tolerability. And I'll note that it has a real commercial benefit as well, because it gives us something that is differentiated, which is a single dose form. So in peds, in adult patients in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, there's only one script for anyone to remember, it's a single dose of the product, a single sort of 1% spinner off the cream VTAMA, whereas some of our competitor products have multiple doses depending on whether you're in psoriasis, whether you're in AD, whether you have a pediatric patient or not. And so, really pleased with that simplicity and is a direct function of the safety profile of the compounds. So very pleased with that data and think it'll be a useful fact as we get towards the AD data.
And then as a final reminder on VTAMA on Slide 13, that AD data is coming. Our Phase 3 program enrollment is on track. We expect data in the first half of next year. There's a ton of patients in investigator enthusiasm for the study, and that's built obviously including on the safety data that I just described, but also on the very strong Phase 2b data that that we've already sort of made public as well as the positive outcome from our Japanese partners atopic dermatitis study, which they reported over the summers. So overall, again, incredibly pleased with the quality of launching in -- for VTAMA looking forward to continue to provide those updates and looking forward to the improvement in GTN and other things that will come from PBM contract, as well as from other contracts that we'll be looking to do here. So in offset on VTAMA, although I'm sure we'll come back to it in the Q&A.
So I want to turn now and talk about a couple of other clinical updates in the rest of our pipelines. So Slide 15, again, you can see a review of our late-stage pipeline with a number of really important therapies, many of them in inflammation and immunology, but also in some other areas as well. A truly broad late-stage pipeline with some opportunities that we won't talk about as much today like Brepocitinib, where we've talked a fair amount in the past about that upcoming data set in SLE and in dermatomyositis as well as Batoclimab and others.
So as of right now on Slide 16, we have seven ongoing major studies including at least four of them pivotal and we expect three more to initiate in the near future as well. So we'll be up sort of 10 pivotal total enabling studies which is a great breadth of R&D from our perspective across the portfolio.
I want to spend a few minutes, and this was an update during the September 30 quarter reminding everybody about an important development at Immunovant in our anti-FcRn franchise starting on Slide 17. We announced is that we've got a new next-generation anti-FcRn antibody to compliment batoclimab there IMVT-1402, which was developed in-house, and which we've shown in animal studies, delivers what we think should be deep potentially best-in-class IgG lowering, similar to what we get from our first antibody batoclimab. Notably, however also and we'll talk more about this in the data, minimal impact in albumin and LDL. So we think this could be the only anti-FcRn antibody to have both minimal or no impact in albumin and LDL, as well as that deep potentially best-in-class IgG and all of that in a simple subcu administration that is also differentiated versus our competitors.
And one of the great things, and we'll hit this again at the end of this section about anti-FcRn antibodies is that IgG lowering has been a really great biomarker across a range of indications. And so we feel like we have a real potential for accelerated development here, where we can use proprietary data from our own studies and well known biology as well as data from industry-wide trials in anti-FcRn antibodies to design our own pivotal programs. And so we think immediately after getting our first in-human data from IMVT-1402, which will come in the middle of next year, we'll be able to go sort of on an accelerated path straight into pivotal studies thereafter, which is something that's unique to the class and sets us up to be really right in the pack with all of our competitors with a best-in-class drug.
So you can see the data as a reminder on Slide 18. And I love this data because it shows so clearly. We get the same IgG suppression as batoclimab. We've got here the sort of supersaturated 50 mg dose, and you can see right on top of each other in terms of the level of IgG suppression, which is important because we think it's necessary to be able to get to that in humans. As a reminder, batoclimab gets to 80%-plus suppression of IgG, which is more than some of our competitors are able to achieve, and which we think will be relevant across disease populations and across patient populations within a disease.
And then you can see on Slide 19, as a reminder again, that we're sort of right on top of placebo at therapeutic doses as far as albumin and LDL impact are concerned. And so we get kind of everything we need here in terms of in these monkey studies, minimal impact or no impact on albumin and LDL and the level of IgG suppression that we think will continue to keep us differentiate as best-in-class. So again, as a reminder data coming in humans in the sort of the middle of next year.
I get fairly often the question of sort of how did we achieve this? And so, on Slide 20, just as a reminder, we've put this slide up before you can see the crystal structures, batoclimab as with many of the full length antibodies FcRn binds to FcRn and the configuration that's very good for suppressing IgG, but also you can see sort of interferes with a steric hindrance of albumin binding on the FcRn as well. And so that sort of causes an impact on albumin. IMVT-1402 on the right-hand side, similarly, high quality binding from an IgG suppression perspective but does not sort of interfere with albumin binding. And so it doesn't affect the albumin level in there for LDL.
As a reminder and this is another question that we've got a little bit on Slide 21, we wanted to summarize all of this in one place. Across all of the known anti-FcRn programs generally including batoclimab, our own program as well as many of the other antibodies that are sort of probably have published data. The translation from monkey data to clinical data has been very strong on albumins. So the impact on albumin observed in NHP has generally been translatable to humans. And so I wanted just to summarize this data in one place so that people had a good reference for it. And we've got all the publications at the bottom there that demonstrated over and over again that monkeys are a good predictor of human data for impact on albumin and therefore we think impact on LDL. And again, we'll get the data from IMVT-1402 on this in mid-2023.
So last thing, I'll say on our anti-FcRn franchise before moving on to other updates, on Slide 22, just as a reminder, this is very broad disease biology. There are many different diseases ranging from sort of ultra-rare diseases to more common diseases. And we have a pretty unique ability because we have both batoclimab and IMVT-1402 in our pipeline to tailor the development strategy for each drug, two different disease populations, and to be able to sort of compete in ways that I think our individual competitors will struggle, are sort of differentially in let's say rare disease settings versus in more common settings where we can take the profile of our drug and we can take the commercial strategy around each of these different compounds and optimize the choice of compound and the development strategy and the commercial strategy to the selection of indication. So looking forward to providing more updates on our development strategy for both IMVT-1402 and batoclimab in the quarters to come. You should expect continuous updates on those as we get programs up and running, and as we sort of learn from our own data and from industry-wide data and think it's going to be an incredibly exciting opportunity. We are truly and I view the best in class anti-FcRn franchise at this moment with the sort of 1402 being a sort of clear best-in-class potential antibody. And with both 1402 and batoclimab in our portfolio allowing us to do some really interesting and differentiated things.
Good. So I'm not going to cover many of the other sort of clinical updates at this point. We continue to make progress in a number of other programs including brepocitinib, which is marching toward its SLE data, as well as namilumab and sarcoidosis and so on. But I wanted to stay focused today on some of the key new things.
So I'm going to give just a couple of additional updates on other parts of the business now including on Slide 24, some data that we have not presented before. So we've not spent a lot of time talking about our discovery organization or a greater discovery efforts, those continue to chug along, and we're doing some interesting things there. It remains a small fraction of our overall burn and obviously a lesser focus. But given some of the high quality data that we've seen recently in ER Degraders, just wanted to highlight that we have an ER Degrader program and this is some new data about that program demonstrating either equal or better tumor volume reduction compared to the most Advanced Degrader known in ER and you can see on the left-hand side, you can see the in vitro data on degradation. And on the right-hand side, you can see that, that, that our compound has either equal or better tumor reduction mouse models. So exciting opportunity. It's early days there. We'll provide more updates on that program when we have them. But just want to highlight that we continue to believe we're going to be able using our unique combination of platforms to develop some interesting best-in-class degraders. And this is not a bet on the next couple of years. This is a bet on the future beyond, but excited what we're going to be able to do with our pipeline as these programs mature.
The other update I'll give briefly, because we get questions about it often on Slide 25, is an update on Genevant's IP litigation. So this is a relatively recent development that some of you may have seen, which is on November 2, the Federal District Court in Delaware denied Moderna's partial motion to dismiss, which as we've talked about before they had filed on the basis of this U.S. contractor defense 1498, which was an attempt by Moderna to shift liability for its alleged infringement, or at least a portion of it to U.S. government taxpayers. And we were pleased to see that the court deny that motion. And most importantly for the case, that means that we'll now move to this pretrial discovery phase where we'll be able to learn more about the state of play and we should be able to provide more updates on that as that phase progresses.
So look to round out the overall discussion on the sort of heart of the business here on Slide 26. I'll just say, I could not be more excited for 2023. It's an incredibly impactful year for us. First of all, it'll be our first full-year of VTAMA on the market, and we look forward to continued prescription and meaningful revenue growth as well as sort of watching early PBM and payer wins really translate into sort of approaching a steady state GTN and a commercially attractive P&L that we've signaled over and over again at this point. We are confident we're going to obtain. So looking forward to be able to provide more guidance there. Looking forward to watching that mature and really think we're going to do some impressive things there.
On top of that, we'll continue to build on the VTAMA sort of franchise, if you will, with Phase 3 data in AD coming in the first half, which opens up an even larger market for VTAMA that we're excited to get into. And we think the high quality of our safety data, the simplicity of our dosing, all going to be important in continuing to sort of grow into that market.
Then as I mentioned just a moment ago we're going to get human data in IMVT-1402, which is expected to be in the clinic starting in the first quarter with the initial Phase 1 data expected mid-year that'll come together with in the second half of next year, initial Phase 2 data in Graves' disease with the ability to take 1402 straight to pivotals thereafter and that Graves' data is in batoclimab but will inform development strategy for 1402 which is a great example of sort of how we think we can move fast with 1402.
And then, finally, not a focus for today's call, but as a reminder the sort of pivotal readout from our global Phase 2b study now fully enrolled in SLE should be one of our two registrational studies if that data's successful in the second half of next year. And reasons that we believe we have a possibility of being some of the best SLE data the world has ever seen, so really looking forward to that data as well.
I'm going to round out today's call with the financial update. I'll use Slide 28 as a partial guidance here. Some of these updates, including some of the updates I've already given on this call, we gave beginning of last week because as I'm sure many of you saw, we did a $150 million follow-on offering with some great institutional investors that we were really excited about. It was catalyzed by our reverse inquiry that that we were excited to take advantage of especially in this market. Even before that offering, we had taken some important steps in our business to make sure that we could give that we'd extended our runway -- that we could give extended runway guidance. So our runway is now comfortably extended into the second half of calendar year 2025. And I will talk in a moment about what we've sort of achieved there, what that extended runway buys us in terms of additional catalysts, there are many, including some really important datasets. We achieved that in a variety of ways. We achieved it with some cross reduction and efficiencies. You may have seen an article over the weekend about an impactful, relatively modest round of layoffs that we've done, that we don't think are going to have any meaningful business impact in terms of slowing us down or changing catalyst. But together, with other changes we made, the business will give us the ability to really sort of drive length of runway, which we think is important given where the market is and given how choppy things have continued to be.
Overall for the quarter adjusted R&D expense of $123 million, adjusted G&A of $102 million and notably, the majority of that G&A expense relates to Dermavant and the commercial launch of VTAMA at this point. So we think that's sort of an important position to be in. And then, ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash or $1.9 billion in effect after our follow-on offering, Immunovant follow-on offering and anticipate proceeds from the sale of minority to Sumitomo Pharma. So a really strong financial position, continue to be pleased with our ability to generate cash from a variety of sources to fund the business many of which non-dilutive. And looking forward to taking advantage of this position in a number of ways, including frankly with some attractive in licensing opportunities that we see that could bring new programs into our portfolio. So stay tuned for updates on that as well.
So I'll finish my prepared marks on Slide 29, with just a reminder, I said 2024 -- 2023 is a really impactful year from a catalyst perspective. As we sort of thought about extending runway and making sure that we sort of catalyze well into 2025, there's really a tremendous amount now within that window. Not only the data from exterior atopic dermatitis data, the brepocitinib data and so on, but additional important data from batoclimab and multiple indications including CIDP, including MG, including thyroid eye disease, the brepocitinib data in dermatomyositis in addition to the brepocitinib data and SLEs coming next year, as well as continued data from RVT-2001 our program in low-risk in transfusion-dependent anemia in low risk Myelodysplastic syndromes and a number of other important catalysts. As well as what will then be multiple years of sales in VTAMA and sort of a clear demonstration of what we think we'll be doing at that point, which is through adding towards blockbuster territory on that product. So really, really excited for next year. Really, really excited for what our current capital runway allows us to achieve in a choppy market and looking forward to continue to provide updates at each quarter and more frequently as they present.
So I'm going to wrap up my comments there and I want to thank everyone again for joining, and I'm going to hand it back over to the operator to open line for Q&A. So thank you, everybody. [Operator Instructions].
Our first question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open. Thanks very much and congrats, Matt, to you and your team on all the progress. So I wanted to focus on the good news on VTAMA and just better understand the contracting. So could you provide more color on what percentage of lives are actually covered immediately with your PBM contract and what percentage required downstream contracting with employers to achieve paid for drug? And to follow-on, what would the timing be for that secondary contracting? And then, separately, could you also discuss your pursuit of health plan coverage in addition to PBM coverage and how you're thinking about opportunities there? Thanks very much. Yes. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate the question and appreciate your listening and obviously this is -- look, this is top of mind for us in terms of our overall strategy at this point on the VTAMA launch. So first of all, I think what most companies would say about this PBM contract is that the PBM covers about 30% of commercial lives. David, you and I have talked a fair amount about this. We've been a little bit more nuanced than how we describe this process, the PBMs have custom -- have national formularies and many lives are covered by that national formulary. And so we'll get access to a decent number. We haven't said exactly which, because it would sort of reveal a little bit more about which PBM we found in the contract with, but a decent number of lives kind of immediately on the back of this contract.
But also this now gives us a template for all of the downstream customers of that PBM, that even for the ones that have their own custom formularies they now have sort of a template. They understand the commercial picture; they understand the value judgment that this PBM placed on the product. And we're sort of confident in looking forward to continuing to sort of build into that.
This is true for all launches. Once you get the PBM contract, you then kind of work your way through the customers of the PBM. We've said probably three months to six months to hit the tail of what that looks like. But I think you can expect lives sort of covered under this PBM sort of turning on for coverage over that period as we continue to work our way through those customers. Notably, I'd say you mentioned employers specifically. I'd say employers are probably less likely than some other payers to have custom formularies of their own. And so it is just going to vary by sort of which specific type of plan it is. And we're sort of every bit is focused on every covered live that we can get our hands on. So in terms of PBMs, which are obviously the overall keys to the process and then the health plans and the employers, I think we're sort of -- we focus on all these things.
We probably will not provide specific updates as we get contracts with downstream customers of the PBM. We may comment on it a little bit, but it's just sort of at this point to us kind of routine from here as far as sort of continuing to build into these downstream plans. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Brian Cheng with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Hey Matt and team, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. My first question is on VTAMA. With your first PBM contract in place, can you walk us through the process perhaps from getting the script at the doctor's office to getting the VTAMA in hand? And how much read through is there from the PA step that we see here from for only prior steroid use from the first major PBM contract to other PBM discussions that are ongoing? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Thank you for listening. Thank you for joining and excited to have you on the call. So welcome to the Group here. I think it's a great question. So first of all, I think it's an important point. The patient experience from having a PBM contract in terms of like timeline and process actually isn't that different thanks to the copay card program that we had in place originally. So patient gets a prescription from the doctor. Many of these docs work with independent retail pharmacies. And so the doc gets the drug -- the prescription over to the pharmacy, the pharmacy works with the patient to get the drug fulfilled. Prior to the contract, patients who weren't covered would then pay a $75 copay because of the VTAMA card, the rest would be covered by the copay card.
And now those same patients if they're covered by this PBM contract or by any other coverage that we obtain, would pay a $0 copay because that's sort of the design of our copay card. But again, we would then get coverage from the payer or the insurance company. So that's kind of the sort of process for a patient to get script filled. And we think it's a good straightforward process.
I think in terms of the template here, I think this was a perfect outcome from a coverage perspective, from my perspective; it gives us everything we need. It gives us access to the patients we're really seeking, which are the patients who are on steroids now. It's what we said from the beginning that's 90% of psoriasis patients. So it's over. We feel really good about the template there.
I will say as far as health plans are concerned, as far as sort of duplicating this model across other PBMs across health plans, given the script volume, as you can imagine, we have a ton of inbound interest from health plans and from -- from -- and active discussion with all the major PBMs on getting the product covered. And that discussion is very constructive given where we are in a volume perspective. I think you said you had a follow-up question. Right. And then maybe just one on SLE since we're going to get top-line data from the Phase 2 trials for SLE in the second half next year. Can you remind us what you want to see in terms of the primary endpoint with SLE for that you need to see in Phase 2 to be deemed as success in the trial? And maybe just if I can squeeze in one more, we noticed that you -- that there was a workforce reduction that was announced over the weekend. Just curious if you can provide a little bit more color how -- whether that has any impact on this program. Thank you. Yes, thanks. So on the SLE question, we haven't given the numerical bar, we'll continue to talk more about what we expect out of that study over the course of next years, the data becomes closer. I'll just say we have a high bar for what we want to achieve there. We think the agent is a powerful agent and we think the biology of the dual inhibition should be relevant specifically to SLE disease biology. So we feel really good. We'd want to see excellent data on SLE forward; we want to see meaningful improvement on key secondaries. I said we'll sort of talk a little bit more about how we think about those scales as we get closer. I think we have evidence from other JAK1s and evidence from other TYK2s on what they've done in SLE, and we think we have a possibility of being more impactful than either of those agents on their own because of the biology here. So kind of looking out for that.
On the question of the risks, look, these are always tough decisions and they impact people's lives. So I don't want to sort of -- I want to be a little bit careful, but I think in general the answer is we don't expect any meaningful impact on any of our sort of major programs or any of our key projects. Nothing that we've talked about on this call should be affected at all by this. We focused on G&A efficiency. We focused on sort of taking the most benefit we could from the model. We focused on making sure that our early stage programs were really focused on the most important and impactful that work. And so I'd say that's kind of where we went there. And as you saw on the endpoint articles, about 12% of overall staff, so not something that we expect to have a meaningful business impact. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes. Good morning, guys. So I guess the -- looks like the effective date for this payer contract went into effect in Octo -- early October. So I'm just curious what portion of scripts written today are being written for patients that are under that recently disclosed coverage agreement. And can you just give us a little bit of color on what the process looks for that patient population? Yes. Thanks, Corinne and thanks for -- thanks for joining the call and obviously thanks for all your coverage. So I -- we haven't given a specific sort of guidance for what percentage of our scripts are covered by this specific contract, referring to the answer to Dave's question earlier, in terms of the way these generally work. This PBM covers about 30% of covered lives altogether. And we expect kind of percolate through those covered lives, starting with the bulk of them that we -- the big chunk of them that we have now sort of percolating down through what we call a three to six month period. So I'd expect to see continued sort of development. And I think as we get more payer contracts they'll accelerate, but I think you can expect to see kind of resulting improvement in GTN starting in the current quarter, starting in the quarter that we'll announce the December 31 quarter because the contract was effective October 31. But it will take some time for all this to percolate through and to really sort of reach steady state. Great. Thanks. And then you mentioned interest in additional in-licensing opportunities. How should we think about the appropriate cadence for in-licensing deals for you all? And then what do you think about as your priorities for the kind of assets you'd be excited to bring in-house? You think it's a great question. I think with one of the reasons that we're focused on making sure our runway is long is because this is a great market to be in a strong capital position. There are some really amazing opportunities available to companies like us. We're really focused on high quality programs that can be impactful in the near and medium-term. I think if we -- we said before, kind of one to two of those a year, we as brepocitinib earlier this year, I wouldn't expect any sort of major change in cadence there other than the -- in the current capital environment, the bar is really high and we want to do things that we can be very capital efficient in executing.
And in terms of what we're looking for, we remain pretty open from a therapeutic area perspective, but we're looking for things where we think we're going to be able to do an important job developing the drug or a differentially -- a good job developing the drug. And we're looking for things that are at the moment kind of mostly later-stage things that can add to the sort of bulk of our late-stage portfolio while sort of fitting within our financial goals. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Your line is now open. Hi, congrats on the quarter. This is Alex for Robyn. We wanted to know, as you continue discussions with physicians and payers have -- there's a lot of positive feedback, looks great, the launch looks very positive. Have you received any pushback or any details to the discussions that might change how you view or approach the launch strategy? And then also for 1402, seems like this is a very sizable opportunity there. We're really excited. How do you think about prioritizing which indications we pursue initially and then the cadence and going into different indications thereafter. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it. Appreciate the question. Appreciate your listening. On the VTAMA question, look, obviously we are constantly taking feedback from docs and from our payer conversations and so on, and making sure that we're tailoring all of our messaging and tailoring our launch plans to that feedback.
In terms of pushback, honestly, I think the interest we have not gotten very much here. I think the drug has been extremely well received. You heard it in our KOL panel. I think you hear it in your own doc calls. I think patients are just excited and doctors are excited to have a new topical option that that really candidly works and works without many of the liabilities that that steroids are widely interested to have. So I'd say no meaningful pushback. But obviously, we're sort of constantly adjusting and reacting and even you think about this PBM contract, obviously we had a bar that we had set for what we hope the quality of coverage would look like. I think this PBM contract represents extremely high quality coverage that's going to work for patients and docs.
And I think we're learning every day as we sort of see the patient and docs experience and as we see the quality of what payers are willing to do given the sort of meaningful impact of the project. Yes.
So on 1402, I think, look, our plan for 1402 which you said a few times is to focus on indications where look like deep and sustained IgG suppression helpful. So chronic administration and in diseases where we think the LDL or the albumin impact might be more material to patients. So you think broader market diseases, think chronic diseases. So I think that's kind of the sort of general framework. We'll get more specific with it as we progress. And then we think 1402 batoclimab fit really nicely together because both can achieve sort of deepest possible best-in-class suppressions of IgGs. And so we can kind of go after any indication with either and expect to be able to deliver comparable or better efficacy to any of our competitors. And so we can really sort of tailor dosing strategy and indication selection by program in a comfortable way. So feeling really good about that portfolio as well. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is now open. Hi guys, this is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats on that update. Just a couple quick ones from us. First on VTAMA, obviously, more PBM impaired discussions is a big focus here as you guys have all kind of outlined. But maybe also -- I also just wanted to ask from a broader commercial competitive dynamics standpoint, I mean, what are the next steps you're all focusing on to the launch, maybe beyond payer coverage, just in terms of getting it in patient, physician hands a little bit earlier if relative to competitors. And then, just a quick one for the FcRn franchise. Can you just remind us if you need to or plan to run kind of a more traditional big Phase 1 study, Phase 2 with 1402 before moving into pivotal studies, or would you be able to move more or less directly into some of these larger registrational studies? Thanks. Yes. Thanks. Appreciate the question and thanks for listening. I'll take the second question first because it's an easy answer, which is we believe that our sort of our plans Phase 1 is that we'll get initial data from the middle of next year will be sufficient together with the data that we have on IgG suppression to go right into pivotal studies. So we think there's a clear path to go straight from sort of the planned Phase 1 into pivotal studies. And I think what we said is sort of six months after that data, we should be able to be in a pivotal study, which is really, again, sort of unique and interesting about the FcRn class, given the quality of IgG as a clinical biomarker.
So I like the first question a lot because to be honest to me, given the quality of the early payer contracts, we feel really, really good about where we are from a coverage perspective. And then if you just think about that slide that I had up earlier about the fact that we're just getting started and sort of the depth of these markets, I think the next question is, 4,000 scripts a week is great and we feel really happy about it. How do we get to 40,000 scripts a week? And that obviously requires continuing to work on changing prescriber behavior, continuing to educate patients on what VTAMA has to offer that is completely different than what they've been able to get historically with topical steroids. So with a lot of different plans for that, obviously DTC is a component of that, but we've started to deploy in a very targeted way. And we'll continue to ramp that up as sort of payer coverage sort of matches it, but again, sort of very targeted sort of precise focused on sort of that that process.
And then, yes, look, we have a large and highly capable MSL force that is out there sort of doing a physician education and scientific communication that we think is important here because again, this really is a paradigm shift in the treatment of psoriasis. Obviously, we think our atopic dermatitis data is going to be impactful here in the simplicity of the product you're prescribed in the AD setting. The fact that we have such a young cohort in the pediatric study with the same drug on the same dose, same product, I think all of those things are going to individually matter. And we're focused on taking maximal advantage of each of those opportunities to get our messages out there and to help people understand what VTAMA can do.
And again, the nice thing is the product really sort of does deliver on so much differentiation from topical corticosteroids in terms of ease of administration, no duration limits, no body surface area limits, none of the really severe tolerability issues. We have a particularly clean label in terms of safety and tolerability, even relative to other novel topicals, no concomitant meds, notices, nothing like that. So just a really straightforward setup and we want docs and patients to think of that as they reach for the drug. So lots of strategies to deploy and excited to keep working on that sort of bigger goal there. And I feel like we're really well set up for it. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is now open. Hi, congrats on all the progress this quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I had a few for you. First one I wanted to ask you about was how do you think about pricing for your first and second generation anti-FcRn? Will this be a competitive advantage for you? And then, secondly, the opportunity for Priovant in SLE and also DM and how the economics work with Pfizer. And then, last question I had for you is how are you thinking about or framing the AD data readout in 2023, especially in light of what we saw with Japan Tobacco and then say versus OPZELURA and prior Phase 2 data you've shown. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Louise. Thank you for listening and thanks for taking for the great questions, all three of them. So starting on FcRn, it's probably premature to come either batoclimab or 1402 specifically, but I'll just say it sort of has to be a competitive advantage to have both drugs available in terms of being able to think about price point to being able to think about other commercial levers that that sort of deploy a franchise strategy across the two program. So I'd say, premature to have a specific comment on price for one or the other, but definitely has to be an advantage to have the franchise for all -- for that and all the other reasons that I've shared.
On DM and SLE for Brepo, we've given a little bit of guidance on the size of the DM population. I think we've given a little bit of information on the size of the SLE population, although I think that's obviously a very well understood population at this point. These are huge commercial markets where success in either of them on its own would be sort of a comfortable blockbuster product in our view. And obviously across the two of them, just a huge opportunity and there's obviously room to go beyond those with brepocitinib in other indications as well. So yes, a very large commercial opportunity.
From an economic perspective with Pfizer, we have effectively U.S. and Japan as our focus. We pay Pfizer sort of relatively modest royalty. I think what we've said publicly is sort of high-single-digit, low-double-digit tier royalties. And we pay them that on our territories. They pay us that on their territories. And then Pfizer owns 25% of Priovant as well.
And then, so you asked about how we were thinking about the AD data and sort of positioning. First of all, as you mentioned, I think we have great comfort here in part because of the quality study run by Japan Tobacco that was successful in part because of the max use PK study in young pediatric patients that we just announced last week. And so we feel really good about kind of where that program is headed. We think it should be a major event for the drug to have that data. Obviously, AD is also a really important market. And you mentioned OPZELURA I think it's a market that has had a little bit more in the way of novel topicals, which obviously OPZELURA, but none of those drugs either from an efficacy perspective or from a tolerability perspective or from a label perspective, afford the kind of clean steroid replacement potential that that that become affords given the safety and what we believe is the potential efficacy profile of the drugs. So we think it should really fit in a similar place in AD that it fits in psoriasis as a potential mainstay of therapy. We like the fact that some of the other topicals, and especially some of the more recently launched ones, the more recently launched one has done such a good job of highlighting demand for a novel topical in atopic dermatitis.
And it's clearly a popular drug and it's clearly doing well in spite of some pretty meaningful limitations on its label. So that -- and they've done a great job with commercial coverage now, and they're sort of gross net yields are progressing. So we feel really good about what that means for our potential in AD where we think we'll have an importantly differentiated product. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. Your line is now open. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on the last question on atopic dermatitis, I'm just curious what you're hearing from dermatologists and physicians that are prescribing to thereof [ph] currently about their desire to prescribe it for atopic dermatitis and whether or not they have actually tried that. And then also regarding the LNP patent update just wondering if there's any potential next steps that Moderna could take to actually try and push the motion to dismiss -- the partial motion to dismiss again, or if you are confident that there really is no other recourse that they can take at this point. Thanks. Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Neena. Thanks for the questions and thanks for listening.
On the AD study, in terms of physician feedback and I -- we don't get specific evidence of off-label prescriptions and things like that, so we don't sort of have a specific view on sort of how it's being used, but we get a ton of prescriber enthusiasm for the drug and we hear a lot of enthusiasm for it, not just in psoriasis, but in AD and in other settings. For starters, we have a ton of enthusiasm from the investigators in our AD study who are using the drug actively as a part of trial process and who are clearly sort of super enthusiastic for what comes next. So I think from that perspective, enrollments on schedule, I feel like we have the sort of promise there.
And as a reminder, our Phase 2b data, we have 49% sort of IGA clear, almost clearer and a two greater improvement at week eight compared to 13% on vehicles. So a really meaningful opportunity there in our Phase 2b study. And yes, great feedback from our Phase 2b investigators on that study as well.
So on the LNP question, the Judge ordered Moderna to file an answer by November 16, the original complaint. And we expect that they will file an answer. They've asked for a modest extension, which attorney granted. So we feel pretty confident that that we'll hear back from them and then we'll be able to move on, as I said, to the discovery phase in the process. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just Matt, in terms of -- and congrats on the progress and in terms of the PBM contract, at what point do you think operationally we should see that reflected in terms of the script volume trend, presumably as it gets easier for patients or for docs to write it, they'll be more inclined to do so, or do you think one contract isn't enough and that we need to wait a little bit before that becomes a real driver of volume? Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the question and yes, appreciate you are listening. So I think but there's a lot of different things sort of conspiring towards the quality of our script volume trajectory in with VTAMA. I'd say easiest payer coverage is one of those things. I think that the copay card has helped in simplifying that process even before we had the contract in place. I think the contract will help too. And I think as docs have confidence that their patients will have a good coverage experience. You can see scripts build. To be honest, again, I think the high prescribing docs already have a lot of that conviction just because of the way we handled the early commercial launch. But I think coverage will certainly help continue build that out. I think you will continue to see scripts building over the coming months and quarters and that's important.
I'd say we expect to see some stair step of prescriptions over time for a variety of reasons. coverage is one of them. The holidays obviously affect prescriber behavior. There's some seasonality that there's some of these populations. So I'd say it may not be kind of literally linear from a true volume perspective, but I do think all of these things are going to add up to consistently growing demand once you take sort of one step back from the week on week numbers. And again, we feel really good about what the contract lets us do there and what the market is sort of guiding us towards at this point from a -- from an enthusiasm perspective. Okay. Great. And then Matt, as a follow-up, I'm just curious, have you given thought about how the IRA might affect your development of certain assets? Because that's certainly something that we've started to hear from companies and certainly sort of rationalizing some of the opportunities that they were planning to pursue just given the potential impact. Thank you. Yes. Thanks. It's a great question. Sort of obviously look, we like the rest of the industry are watching really closely as this evolves and it's already factored into how we think about allocation of capital across the portfolio. So you can see, we think differently about molecules than we used to think. We sort of think differently in general about specific programs. We are obviously compared to some of our bigger peers less impacted in the near-term than some of them might be. And so we've got a little bit more time to kind of watch and learn. And it's just -- it's a pretty rapidly evolving situation, but absolutely affects our capital decisions today. [Operator Instructions].
Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks. This is Yuchen with Jefferies. Two questions on our end. The first on EU launch and efforts, could you just tell us where you are and when you would expect any updates on the EU process and what commercial preparations you have made in advance of the approval? And on the second question on the mRNA patent litigation, it's nice to hear the judge deny Moderna on the motion to dismiss. But factually, what are the next steps here and what specific dates do we need to know and when do you expect us to move to discovery? Yes. Thanks. Both good questions. So on EU for VTAMA, we don't have a new update to provide right now. We continue to work towards that opportunity and to think about different approaches for commercializing in Europe. It's obviously a big commercial market, especially given the number of patients. So we'll provide an update when we have one that's more specific, but I don't have a specific date or timeline to provide today.
And then on -- and just as a reminder, by the way, the Japanese program is now on a path to approval after the positive study there. So and we'll get some commercial economics from the launch in Japan.
As far as the Moderna question is concerned, I said sort of in November we expect Moderna’s overall response and can we expect to move into discovery kind of just after. So I think you can expect there'll be a calendar set for discovery that'll be the subject of some discussion with the judge. And perhaps once that calendar set will be able to provide a little bit more of an update, whether that's sort of end of this year or early next year or something like that on timing. But I'd expect the discovery process will take some time and perhaps more updates kind of over the course of next year as that progresses. Please standby for our next question. And our next question comes from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. I think that was our prior question. One moment, please. I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Matthew Gline for closing remarks. Thank you very much. Thank you for the operator. Thank you to everyone who worked to get us through a pretty impactful, important quarter and thank you everyone for listening this morning. Look forward to continuing to provide updates at upcoming investor conferences and with our next quarter. And yes, everyone have a great day. Thank you so much. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the Roivant Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Paul Davis, Head of Communications. You may begin. Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining today’s call to discuss Roivant’s third quarter results and business updates. I am Paul Davis, the Head of Communications at Roivant. On the call today, we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer; Richard Pulik, our Chief Financial Officer; Frank Torti, our Vant Chair; Eric Venker, President and Chief Operating Officer; and finally Mayukh Sukhatme, President and Chief Investment Officer.
For those dialing in via phone, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We will also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along. I would like to remind you that we will be making certain forward-looking statements during today’s presentation that reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our product candidates. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we have filed with the SEC, including the earnings release and Form 10-Q filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties.
We will begin with Matt Gline who will review key business updates across Roivant in advance and provide a financial update. We will end the call with a Q&A session.
Without further ado, I will turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. It’s been an eventful quarter for us, with a number of key updates, including Immunovant putting batoclimab back into the clinic in myasthenia gravis, including favorable Appeals Board decision on Genevant in December, including the introduction of a new program at a new Vant, at Hemavant in myelodysplastic syndrome. So I am excited to share those and other updates over the course of today’s presentation.
I will begin on Slide 4 just by giving an overview of some of the key features of our business as well as some of the key updates, and then I will go through a number of them in more detail. So I want to start by saying that both the prior quarter and the coming year are incredibly exciting for Roivant as a company, with a number of important projects coming to fruition over the coming months and year. The first of those is our near-term commercial launch of tapinarof, a potential blockbuster in psoriasis, a topical treatment of psoriasis with an expected PDUFA date in the second quarter of 2022, and a launch thereafter.
We will talk more about that in a moment. That’s backed by a number of updates in our broad clinical stage pipeline. We will have at least 8 pivotal proof-of-concept trials running by the end of this year. And that includes progress at our newest Vant, Hemavant, with RVT-2001, recently added to our pipeline of first-in-class – or potential first-in-class oral SF3B1 modulator for transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with low risk MDS. That includes updates at Immunovant and batoclimab, as I mentioned and that includes other updates at a number of other programs, including our sickle cell disease program as well as namilumab or anti-GM-CSF antibody with improved IND and sarcoidosis.
We will be talking today a little bit more about strategy in our discovery platform, where we have made some significant progress in crystallizing our plans and in adding capabilities that we think will give us a differentiated strength at designing the small molecules as well as a number of other areas of asymmetric potential upside, including Genevant with both our intellectual property and scientific capabilities, delivering novel and important lipid nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery as well as continuing updates in our early stage clinical pipeline. And all of that backed by a strong capital position with $2.2 billion in cash as of December 31, plus a significant amount, about $870 million in public equity stakes and some private holdings, including of Datavant.
So I’m going to start today’s presentation by giving everyone an update on tapinarof at Dermavant, which is a program that we are obviously very excited about, starting on Page 6. So as a reminder, tapinarof is a topical agent for the treatment of psoriasis. It’s a therapeutic aryl hydrocarbon modulator. It’s the only such – it’s the only drug of that mechanism that we are aware of and we are – we have our data in psoriasis and have an ongoing study in atopic dermatitis, with data expected in the first half of 2023. I don’t want to remind people as it comes to tapinarof of some of the attributes that make us excited about the program, including a remarkable treatment effect with significant efficacy, efficacy that we think is as good or better than anything that has been observed in a topical before, with up to 40% of patients over the course of our clinical program completely clearing their psoriasis, with significant durability. So, our drug continues to perform better in our long-term extension study, the longer the patients stay on it, including beyond 12 weeks.
With what we believe to be a completely unique to topicals remittive benefit, where I mentioned 40% of the drugs – or 40% of the patients who go on drug completely clear their psoriasis in our study. They stay clear of drug off therapy or mostly clear for about 4 months on median, which is something that’s attractive to payers, obviously, attractive to patients and attractive to physicians. And all of that is coupled with a very favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no treatment-related serious adverse events in any of our pivotal studies, the late-stage studies and with significant tolerability, so with no questions of tolerability for long duration therapy or duration across – or therapy across all different locations on the skin. So, a profile that we think compares favorably certainly to the standard of care of topical corticosteroids without any of the – at least in our study without any limitations on duration that you see with the topical corticosteroids without any limitations on where you can use it on your body as observed with some of the topical corticosteroids.
On Page 7, I want to remind people of one piece of relatively recently disclosed data that we think is exciting about the drug, which is the data we have shown previously, but to highlight the rapid onset of action is one of the things that we think will be important to this as we launched tapinarof later this year, with our drug having achieved statistically significant improvement in PASI from baseline as early as week 2 in our study and in fact, a 20% reduction in disease activity in week 2 relative to vehicles. So, we think there is a significant benefit here early on in treatment and we think that will matter to patients.
In fact, on Slide 8 and this is a new piece of information that we have put out this quarter relatively recently. Dermavant as part of our long-term extension study included patient satisfaction data. And you can see on this chart both on the left hand side, patient satisfaction vis-à-vis other topical treatments. And on the right hand side, you can see patient satisfaction versus systemic drugs. And so, one of the things interesting is 80% plus of patients strongly agreed or agreed that tapinarof was more effective than other topical drugs they have used in the past and preferred tapinarof to other topical drugs they have used in the past.
And given the attributes that I described on the earlier slide here both from a treatment effect perspective and a safety and tolerability perspective, we would have expected that. One of the things that’s remarkable is over two-thirds of patients, 67.8% of patients also preferred tapinarof to systemic drugs they have used in the past, which given the high level of efficacy associated with systemic therapy and the fact that often severe patients around systemic therapy. It was exciting to us to see just how many patients preferred tapinarof to systemic drugs. So, these are the kinds of data that matter to prescribers and the kind of data that matter to patients obviously. And we think that dermatologists are looking at this and are getting excited for our potential launch later this year.
On Slide 9, a little bit about that launch. So, we are fully preparing for a launch in the second quarter, including getting ready to deploy a specialty sales force capable of calling on dermatologists to write more than 80% of all commercial prescriptions in the psoriasis market. To do that, we are going to hire 75 to 100 reps, which will allow us to reach the 6,000 highest valued dermatology healthcare providers. And we think that will be supported by a key commercial leadership team, many of the members of which have already been hired and we are conducting a number of more of those hires over the course of the coming quarter, so really excited about the execution of Dermavant from a very high quality team that we are pleased to support.
On Page 10, just a reminder of some of the recent progress at Dermavant, including that our NDA submission remains on track with no expectation of the advisory committee for PDUFA in the second quarter, including manufacturing and commercial production readiness on track to ensure a high-quality and predictable supply of drug. As I mentioned, the commercial organization is being built out as we speak. We did in the quarter have a data from our PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials published New England Journal of Medicine. So, that was an exciting sort of scientific closure to those trials. And then we continue to have strong enrollment in our ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 Phase 3 trials evaluating tapinarof and atopic dermatitis and we continue to expect top line data from that program in the first half of 2023. So, we look forward to providing more updates on tapinarof and atopic dermatitis over the course of this year. And we think that will be an important part of the story for us as well.
So with that, I am going to move on from tapinarof to some other parts of our business. And on Slide 12, just as a reminder, we have a broad clinical development stage pipeline. So, this is our clinical and close to the clinic development stage pipeline with many programs, tapinarof what we talked about, batoclimab and Immunovant that we will talk about a little bit later and a number of other programs, too many to talk about on a call like this one, but we look forward to sharing updates on many of these programs over the course of calls like this one in the conference presentations over the course of this year.
And on Page 13, just to highlight, 2022 was actually a really important year for us from a clinical development execution perspective. And even just among the things we have already talked about, 3 pivotal study initiations expected for batoclimab and Immunovant this year. We remain on track to initiate a Phase 2 trial with namilumab for sarcoidosis. That’s our anti-GM-CSF antibody. And during this past quarter, the IND for that program in sarcoidosis that’s been approved. We remain on track to initiate a multiple ascending dose trial for our program at Lysovant, with the IND accepted in January of ‘22. And we will talk a little bit more about this program on this call. We are looking forward to conducting a robust open label expansion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in RVT-2001 at our newly formed Hemavant in lower risk MDS. So, many important clinical programs ongoing this year with an expectation of near-term data supporting what we think is going to be a unique and interesting pipeline.
I am going to start first on the development side by talking about Hemavant, which is the newest Vant in the Vant family. It was just built around a program that we in-licensed just late last year. And so I will start on Page 15. So, the program here is called RVT-2001. It is a potential first-in-class small molecule SF3B1 modulator for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with lower-risk MDS. So SF3B1, if you are not familiar with is a target in the spliceosome and the program came from Eisai, where Eisai had been focused on developing it for higher risk progressive MDS patients as well as patients with AML and CMML and it wasn’t totally clear from their data, whether it was exactly an appropriate therapy for that population.
But as we looked at the data we are going to share some of it on today’s call, we got excited about RVT-2001 for a different patient population, namely the population of transfusion-dependent anemia or the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in lower risk myelodysplastic syndrome. And this is a market, as you may know, that has been recently validated by luspatercept with Reblozyl, a BMS drug that launched last year and is now annualizing at over $500 million a year, five quarters into launch. And BMS is forecasting that to be an over $4 billion peak sales drug, much of which coming from this lower risk MDS population. And our interest in that population is driven, as I said, by some encouraging proof-of-concept data in the 80 plus patient Phase 1/2 study that’s been conducted in our drug and we will talk some more about that data. And we have a multi-pronged development strategy to optimize the drug’s impact in that patient population before getting to it.
So on Page 16, a, is a little bit of a reminder of what this patient population looks like, and b, is a little bit of a discussion about how we expect our drug to play. So we are focused here, as I said, on the group of lower risk MDS patients. So there are about 17,000 new MDS cases each year and about 115,000 MDS patients total and lower risk patients are both significant traction about two-thirds of new patients as well as an even higher fraction of the prevalent population. So – and these are quite sick patients. Low risk MDS is a chronic condition with therapy focused on management of symptoms. And first line therapy is mostly erythropoiesis stimulating agents, ESAs, but they are not very effective. And so there are number of drugs approved for later line therapy, just a couple, luspatercept and lenalidomide, each approved for subsets of patients. Luspatercept is approved currently in second line therapy, although BMS has said they are continuing to develop in earlier line therapy. Lenalidomide, which has significant toxicities is really only approved for a mutant subset, the minus subset of MDS patients. And both of those drugs also leave room for improvement. Luspatercept is effective in less than 50% of patients.
And so, RVT-2001 is a potential oral therapy, first of all, which is different from luspatercept in a genetically validated target that’s mutated and up to 80% of certain subsets of the MDS patient population, which is thought to be an important target in driving MDS, mutations in SF3, to be important. Our initial plan is to target second line, principally in SF3B1-mutated patients with the potential to expand across other spliceosome mutations as well as to expand to patient populations who are refractory to luspatercept, where as I said, there is still significant and to lead into earlier therapy over time.
So, I want to talk on Page 17, a little bit about our early clinical data and why we are excited about the program. I will highlight, this is a relatively high-risk program in part because a lot of this data comes from relatively smaller ends and from cross-trial comparisons, but we think it paints an interesting picture. So, in the existing Phase 1/2 study that I referred to with 84 patients for us MDS, AML and CMML, only a relatively small subset of those patients, because it wasn’t Eisai’s main treatment interest, we are in our patient population of interest, so only 19 of the patients had lower risk transfusion-dependent MDS. And in that patient population, we saw a red blood cell transfusion independence rate of a little over 30%.
Now, that in and of itself is not necessarily a particularly compelling result only in the sense of luspatercept, for example, has responder rates in the 40s. But what was interesting upon further investigation is the subset of patients that we were focused on is – it turned out to have been a highly sort of pretreated patient population with 15 of the 19 patients having been pre-treated either with lenalidomide or with prior HMA therapy. And what’s interesting about that is both luspatercept and lenalidomide in prior trials have struggled significantly in those pretreated patient populations. So luspatercept, for example, had only achieved a 13% red blood cell transfusion independence rate among lenalidomide pretreated patients and luspatercept’s Phase 2 trial. And in fact, that result was so challenging that luspatercept’s Phase 3 study actually excluded lenalidomide pretreated patients. And lenalidomide in an investigator-sponsored trial saw a 12% withholding the HIE, that’s a different endpoint sort of a transfusion reduction endpoint in HMA-pretreated patients. So that alone and first of all is interesting, right. We saw a significantly higher response rate. In fact, over double the response rate of transfusion independence relative to luspatercept or lenalidomide in a similarly pretreated population.
Now, further and on top of that, one of the things, that’s been interesting to us as we have studied the field is that both luspatercept and lenalidomide saw significant improvements as they move to earlier line and less protruded patients. So luspatercept, for example, in that same study where they had only a 13% transfusion independence rate, saw 44% red blood cell transfusion independence for patients without lenalidomide for treatment. And as I mentioned, that led them to actually exclude lenalidomide pretreated patients from their Phase 2. And in that same study that I mentioned for lenalidomide on HMA-pretreated patients, 38% response rate or 38% on this HIE or patients who have not been HMA-pretreated versus 12% post-HMAs, so again, significant improvement as those drugs move from earlier line setting. And so not only does our data suggest that we may have a significantly different effects or differently greater effects in heavily pretreated patients, but there is a chance if we see a similar improvement as we move to earlier line patients that we could have an overall best-in-category therapy for these transfusion-dependent MDS patients. So that data got us excited. Obviously, this is a relatively risky program for the reasons I mentioned, but if we are successful, we think we have got a couple of different paths, so an important program.
So on Page 18, in terms of what we are doing from here. So we are taking the existing ongoing Phase 1/2 trial and we are expanding it by 50 to 60 patients. We expect to be able to do that over the course of next year with the data coming in 2023. We are going to focus on lower risk MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations. That’s about 30% of MDS patients overall and a significantly higher portion of MDS patients in some of the more important subsets for this purpose. And we are going to specifically look for certain biomarkers, including a biomarker called [indiscernible] 14C transcripts. We are in a small subset of our patients, 5 out of 7 responded, so very high response rate. And those [indiscernible] transcripts are associated with certain SF3B1 mutations in a way that gives us some biological understanding of why that might be. So, we see a couple of different paths to patient impact here.
Obviously, there is the possibility for a biomarker-driven sort of very specific precision approach to treating certain patients. There is the possibility for a therapy that can deliver for pretreated patients, greater efficacy than the other existing therapies on the market. And there is a possibility if we see a continued improvement as we move to earlier line patients that we could have an overall best-in-category treatment effect in a market that’s important and in a patient population significant, but that continues to have significant unmet need. And that couples with certain other attributes, including a relatively benign tolerability profile as well as oral dosing, which is something that the other therapies don’t currently have. And one other note, which is this drug, because Eisai was testing it for higher risk MDS patients, was dosed in a more acute setting. And we have improved our dosing to a more – to chronic-dosing paradigm, which we also think will help us deliver an appropriate amount of drug to these patients.
But the last thing I will say on this is, although this is a relatively higher risk study, relatively minimal data decay has been observed in past MDS trials from Phase 2 to Phase 3. And so our hope is that after we get data next year, we can be reasonably confident if that data are compelling, but we have a therapy that matters. And so that’s a little bit about our program in MDS. The last thing I’ll say about this is, I think it’s a pretty good example of how we think about deal-making and programs at Roivant. So this was about an $8 million upfront cash and $7 million upfront equity payment for this therapy, which is, we think, attractive commercial terms. And overall, for around $50 million, and we will get the answer to the question in this Phase 1/2 study, which should set us up for interesting data are compelling. And otherwise, it will have been a relatively modest investment relative to where our overall portfolio is. So an exciting program, something we’re glad to have added to the pipeline, and something we’re excited to share more about through this year and especially next year as we get data in 2023.
Next, I’ll just briefly review progress at Immunovant. So Immunovant has shared all of this at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. And so I won’t go into great detail here, but we are very excited for the fact that batoclimab now has a clear path back into the clinic in Myasthenia Gravis and other indications. So I just wanted to remind people a little bit about that situation, starting on Page 20, which – Page 20 really is just a reminder that anti-FcRn antibodies have potential in a very large population of patients.
There are over 1 million U.S. patients and over 1 million European patients – like over 1.5 million European patients with autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease just in this list of indications alone and there are others. We have announced three indications, myasthenia gravis, WAIHA, and at Immunovant. And we said we expect to announce two more through the middle of this year. So we will talk a little bit more about that later. But a patient population we’re excited about, and we think the FcRn class is going to matter a lot with the potential for sort of double-digit billion dollars in overall market cash.
So on Slide 21, as a reminder, we announced at the beginning of this year, a little bit more information about our plan for the Phase 3 trial design Myasthenia Gravis. And I want to highlight, and this is a little bit of a schematic on this slide, but just the way the autoimmune diseases are treated generally is often through a combination of induction and main therapy with the possibility for rest immunologists are used to treating diseases flexibly. They are used to using higher doses of therapy to get patients controlled. They are used to being able to maintain patients chronically on drug, and they used to being able to uptitrate or down titrate depending on severity of symptoms and reflare. And batoclimab and Immunovant is really the only anti-FcRn antibody that is really being tested in that kind of treatment paradigm that matches the way Myasthenia Gravis experience their disease and the way that immunologists reduced to treating it.
So our trial has an induction phase where we test higher doses, including a 680 milligram dose for 12 weeks, a maintenance phase where we test lower doses going down to including a 340-milligram every other week dose. And on a long-term extension, where we’re able to optimize control of the patients, including both up and down titration as needed for each individual patient. And we think this will allow us to achieve a few things. It will allow us to achieve fast treatment of disease symptoms, it will allow us to maintain on an individualized basis, that treatment, including managing side effects such as cholesterol in a comfortable way for patients while their disease is controlled, and we think it will allow patients to titrate as they have disease flare ups in order to manage their experience of symptoms.
On Slide 22, we show a little bit about how that stacks up versus some of our competitors if Efgartigimod and batoclimab – and in short, we believe we are the only program that is designed to match the design sort of match that through new paradigm in the sort of optimal way. And so Efgartigimod, for example, was approved in more of a cyclical paradigm with 4 weeks of treatment on and then additional cycles after a pause based on loss of response. And remember, the approved Efgartigimod is an IV-administered therapy although there is also a bridge to Halozyme formulation.
Nipocalimab has a loading dose, so a little bit of induction therapy, but only one single loading dose before going to a lower dose treatment paradigm, so not necessarily designed to maximize early treatment effect. And nipocalimab in the long-term extension study only allows for down titration while we allow for both down titration and vascular therapy. And nipocalimab again today is an IV therapy, although they have discussed [indiscernible]. And as a reminder, batoclimab addresses all three of these things. We have continuous dote with induction and maintenance. We have down titration, and rescue therapy allowed. And as you may know, batoclimab rather was developed from the beginning as a routine simple subcutaneous administered injection, which we think will make this easiest for patients and physicians to manage.
On Page 23, just as a reminder, the market for batoclimab is certainly not limited to Myasthenia Gravis, and we’re excited to initiate pivotal trials in three indications total, including Myasthenia Gravis, and we’re going to announce those two additional indications before August of this year. And so we are excited to share those indications as well as additional plans for those trials and we will be back in touch to do so in the near future. So, those are some updates on our development stage pipeline. There is obviously a number of other programs that we haven’t had time to talk about today, and we will move in the future. But I want to move now to our discovery organization where we’ve been doing a fair amount of work over the past months to really crystallize our strategy and to focus on what we think are unique and differentiating capabilities.
So I’m not going to talk much about specific programs or targets today, but I want to give you a sense for how we’re thinking about the composition of this program in general. And really what I’ll say is we’ve built Roivant Discovery with the idea that through our computational platform, we can target the 80% of targets that have been very difficult to drug historically, using a variety of different techniques that are all bolstered by our computational capability. And the areas on which we’re focused, the first of which we’ve talked about a bit, is heterobifunctionals, mostly targeted protein degraders, which is an area that we think our computational platform and wet lab capabilities really set us apart from the field.
We’re focused on covalency, which is an important emerging area, obviously, a focus for a number of biotech companies, where we think a combination of proteomics and computational tools will give us a unique ability to identify opportunities to drug historically difficult to drug proteins. And then finally, we have an area that we call deficiency to best in class, which is we think the atom-by-atom understanding that we have of different proteins really gives us the ability to look at existing small molecules, whether they are development candidates or even in some cases, approved therapies that have established potential biologically or commercially, but have well-understood limitations like an affinity or binding limitation or an off-target tox effect, and to be able to understand the geometries of those proteins and those affinity relationships and to optimize to resolve some of those efficiencies.
So I’m going to talk about each of these briefly in turn, starting on Page 26, and heterobifunctional. So we’ve talked about this a little bit before. And this is an area that we’re excited to be participating in the area, especially in targeted protein degradation. And so we think this is going to be a sort of killer app for computational tools in drug discovery. And we’ve combined a really best-in-class wet lab chemistry team that has deep experience in discovery of new degraders with the computational platform that gives us, we believe, the most accurate prediction of ternary complex formation, the most accurate prediction of ubiquitination, of any that we’re aware of. And in a way that lets us really get to the heart of the degrader discovery problem to understand how both the affinity of a small molecule ligand of the warhead as well as the linker geometry and the E3 ligase ligand can come together to achieve an optimal ternary complex and to achieve ubiquitination at the highest possible rate. We think this will let us design degraders against targets that other people have struggled where we can really optimize repertory complex formation. And we feel like we are at a relatively unique quarter of degrader space in the sense that we have well lab chemistry expertise and tools specific to heterobifunctional specific to degraders that goes beyond what we believe is any of the other computational companies.
And on the other side, we have expertise in modeling degrader and computational tools model of ternary complexes that we think go beyond the computational tools by a significant margin of any of our peers on degrader side. And so we feel like we are in a unique corner having both the best computational capabilities of any degrader company and the best well chemistry degrader capabilities of any computational company, and we feel like that sets us up for a differentiated opportunity. The first of Roivant’s degrader programs will enter the clinic, we believe this year, and there is a number of others behind it, and we’re excited to share pre-clinical data over the course of the year on a number of programs as we move forward.
So on Page 27, I’ll move to the next pillar here, which is on covalency. So again, this is an area that’s got a increasing interest in biotech lately, and we’ve built a team here of chemoproteomics experts as well as computational experts that we think are going to set us aside here as well. So what we’ve begun by doing here, and this is a combination of chemoproteomics and computational tools, is by mapping what we call the Reactome, which is to understand the residues on the surface of a protein and how they map to different, how different immuno acids map to that residue so that we can start to understand a combination of chemoproteomic approaches and a deep computational understanding for the area around various covalent binding opportunities whether it is possible to drug some otherwise difficult to find drugs.
So we use sort of chemoproteomics-based hit finding to screen proteins in their biological state and to find opportunities for binding. And then because our computational tools give us a very accurate understanding of protein geometry, including around the covalent-binding sites, we can figure out how to design selective drugs against those chemoproteomics-based hits. So we think this is going to matter for a variety of protein categories that have been difficult to drug, including things like transcription factors. And again, we’re excited to share some more information of our programs coming out of this capability in the near future.
And then finally, on Slide 28, I talked a little bit about some intro here, but the other sort of pillar we have added here is something we are excited about in part, but I think it’s going to give us the ability to move very quickly is to work on programs where there is starting chemical matter, where there is an understanding of affinity and understanding of a relationship between a small molecule and protein, but where there is some well-understood deficiency there where there is an off-target tox effect that is understood, and so we know where the off-target tox finding is taking place or whether there is a selectivity issue or maybe there is multiple isoforms of target. And it’s really important to hit certain nice forms, but not others or certainly mutant variants, but not others. And what we feel like – our computational tools are allowing us to do is to start from that starting chemical matter to really understand the limitations of that affinity or property relationship to the protein and to be able to work backwards and redesign or reengineer those small molecules to improve that efficiency, and ultimately result in a best-in-class therapeutic. And among the things that are exciting about this in us being able to deliver meaningful patient impact is being able to do it fast, to be able to go from start to a drug in the clinic quickly because we’re starting from a well-understood problem iterating rapidly from a computational perspective in a way that we think is going to matter.
So on Slide 29, just to wrap up the discussion on the discovery side, really, we feel like our discovery strengths lie at the intersection between the computational platform looks been a fair amount of time talking about our molecular dynamics toolkit, our machine learning capabilities, our large GPU-based supercomputer with force field engine that allows us to simulate all kinds of things we incur complex structures with a high level of precision. There are relatively few other companies in the world that can do that kind of thing, with unique extreme capabilities that have been hand chosen to pair with our computational tools, so chemoproteomics and biophysics, and wet lab chemistry with degrader expertise with specific tools capabilities designed to pair with the modeling that we’re doing. And then all of that sits together with Roivant’s clinical expertise and with our history of clinical development.
And we haven’t talked about today, but remember that the Vant model has resulted in eight positive Phase 3 trials of nine that we’ve run with now four FDA-approved medicines currently at Sumitovant and a partner. And so a long history of clinical development, including creative clinical development and all of the programs coming out of our discovery engine across the pillars I just described, get the benefit of moving through that oven ecosystem, and we believe that will allow us to rapidly, successfully develop exciting drug candidates coming out of with discovery. So I wanted to share that update. It’s a little bit more precision than we’ve given in the past on what our discovery organization looks like and how we’ve divided it up from a capabilities and tools perspective.
So I am going to move on from here talk about a couple of other items, including one source of some asymmetric potential upside that people are paying attention to. So on Slide 31, just as a reminder, I’m going to talk a little bit about Genevant. So Genevant is a leading company in the field of nucleic acid delivery, focused in particular, not exclusively, but largely on the design of novel lipid nanoparticles. There is deep history of Genevant in the area of lipid nanoparticles dating back really to almost the very beginning of LNPs, certainly in their use in biotech. And as you may know, what’s exciting about LNPs is they are a tool for getting fragile nucleic acids into the body and into target cells. Otherwise, nucleic acids do great quickly and don’t get to the sort of part of the cell where it’s needed in order for them to have the therapeutic effect. And LNPs allow nucleic acids like RNAi, like mRNA to get into cells so they can deliver a therapeutic benefit. LNPs have emerged as the primary needs for delivering mRNA therapy, so almost all of the mRNA therapies in development are delivered via LNPs. It’s worth noting that LPs are also occasionally using the liver of RNA, for example, based therapy. And in fact, Genevant LNP therapy is used in the delivery of the Alnylam’s Onpattro under LNP license from Arbutus.
So on Slide 32, just to quickly note, we’ve had continued progress at Genevant this quarter, including our recently announced collaboration with 2seventy bio providing access to ontology develop gene editing therapies for hemophilia A. So gene editing is another area where LNP has been highly relevant, and we’re excited to use our technology and collaboration to make some progress in that important field. And then on the intellectual property side, as many of you may know, in December, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals projected Moderna’s appeal of a PTAB decision, so Moderna had attempted to invalidate a number of our important LNP patents dating back 2018. And in early December, the Federal Appeals Court affirmed the validity of our patents in a way that was important to us, and obviously, something we were pleased to see. So we expect to provide further updates on Genevant in the near future, and look forward to doing so.
So to wrap up today’s – the presentation portion of today on Slide 34, just by highlighting some of our key financial items from the quarter. So for the 3 months ended December 31, 2021, we had R&D expense of $153 million with adjusted R&D expense of $119 million. We have G&A expense of $116 million with adjusted non-GAAP G&A expense of $61 million for a total net loss of $306 million or an adjusted non-GAAP net loss of $157 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.2 billion, and limited debt. Our balance sheet debt is about $204 million with the principal credit facility making up $32 million of that, and the remainder being the fair value of milestone payments related to the tapinarof, and we have about 690 million common shares issued and outstanding as of February 9.
So on Slide 35, as I wrap up my presentation, thank you again for listening. I just want to highlight that 2022 was an incredibly exciting year for us, again, with the FDA approval decision for tapinarof expected in the second quarter, with top line data coming in the first half of next year, with batoclimab getting into multiple new programs in the clinic, with data expected – and what we shared is we have it on additional patients in our sickle cell gene therapy event, we didn’t spend any time today talking about it, but we continue to enroll patients in our Phase 1/2 trial in sickle cell disease and look forward to sharing more updates on that program over the course of this year, also look forward to discussing the initiation of our Phase 2 trial in sarcoidosis Kinevant. We’re going to continue to expand and enroll patients into our Phase 1/2 trial and lowers that we talked about earlier and a number of other updates coming from around the pipeline, including multiple programs generating data in our preclinical discovery pipeline that we look forward to describing further.
So I want to thank you again for listening. I obviously covered a fair amount of ground, and looking forward to continue to provide these updates. And at this point, I’ll wrap up and go back to the operator for Q&A. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. So I actually had a question on RVT-2001. You spent a lot of time going through it today, which is very helpful. So just a little confused on when we will get the next updated data set. So you said you plan to amend ongoing Phase 1/2. Can you just go into a little bit more granularity on like when you talk to the FDA? What your options are? It sounded like if you look at biomarkers, is there a quick path to market? I think you said 2023 we might get a Phase 3 data. Just can you go into a little bit more detail, because I think it’s important to figure out like what the time lines are for readouts? Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Robyn. I appreciate the question, and thanks very much for listening. And sorry if I caused confusion, so I’ll try and clear that up. So we are – the Phase 1/2 study is ongoing. And so the fastest path for us to continue to enroll, the patients we’re focused on was to expand that Phase 1/2 study. We will provide an update on the enrollment in that study, on the trial expansion in the middle of this year. And we expect to have data from that 50 to 60 patient cohort in 2023. So that will be data from the Phase 1/2 trial, giving us responder rate information for a larger subset of SF3B1-mutated low-risk MDS patients. That data will be in 2023. If that data are positive, if it shows a compelling FNF patient population, we will then initiate a pivotal program. So there will be a pivotal study before the drug is approvable in the indication. But we will have the data next year. And the thing that I said when I was talking about the program is one of the things we like about MDS is the Phase 3 trials tend to be pretty good at replicating the results of Phase 2 studies. So, we are hoping that once we have data next year, if it’s compelling, we have a relatively straightforward lower-risk path at that point to a therapeutic, but we are still going to have to go through a pivotal trial. The other thing I would remind you about the Phase 1/2, which is an open-label study. And so there is a possibility that we at least will have some additional information over the course of the trial, but I would guide towards 2023 for when I would expect to really know the answer there. Got it. And one other follow-up on tapinarof, the Amgen guided double-digit growth. They are obviously in different indications. But an impressive sort of analysis that patients like topical – your topical over there systemic. Can you give more color on like what systemic they were on and what type of patients that you were looking at in that analysis? Yes. So , this was all of the patients in our in our Phase 3 – in our Phase 3 extension study went through the survey. There was no limitation on which prior therapies patients in the - our program could be on. So, we don’t necessarily know specifically. They were just general psoriasis patient populations. And so you assume they have been on the kinds of things that psoriasis patients are on, whether it’s orals or injectable systemics. And so it really is a mixture. And the other thing I will remind you is the patient population in our program overall was 10% mild, 80% moderate, 10% severe psoriasis patients. So, you would expect to sort of gram bag and patients who have been on a variety of different systemic therapy. The only requirement was that patients be willing to wash out of whatever therapy they were on. So, none of these patients were on systemic therapy at the time of no trial. Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Robyn. Thanks again for the questions. Thanks. Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is open. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Matt, I got a couple. The first one is on 2001. When we look at the earlier Phase 1, essentially, the two different doses, you sort of alluded to it. You did a five-day on, nine-day off, and then there is total a 21-day on, seven-days off. When you are thinking about your dose to really get to the right therapeutic window, what are you thinking for the next 50 to 60 patients? And then secondly, can you comment whether Moderna requested an unbound meeting from – as the next step. I think they were supposed to do that within a month or so of the FcRn LPFCC appeal? Thank you. So, I will start with the 2001 question, and I will give a brief answer, and then just in case maybe much anything I will hand it over to Mayukh. In short, I don’t think we have given the exact specifics on our intended dose, but we are moving to – we are moving away from that sort of episodic dosing to chronic administration of therapy at a lower daily dose, but where we think the pharmacokinetic effect result in a potentially higher dose delivered over time. I don’t know if you have anything to add to that? Yes. I think – hi – hi Yaron, nice to hear from you. One of the things that I think we have learned from the asset so far is you can actually track sort of perturbation in transcription over time on dose. And I think what we find is that actually, if you discontinue dose, you actually lose the pharmacodynamic effect pretty quickly. And so as Matt said, I think we are looking to really kind of mimic the dosing that really places the drug’s strength, and will have an effect on innovation sort of continuously. Great. Thanks, Mayukh. And then on your other question – so on Genevant, and thanks for the question. I guess the short answer is Moderna has not requested an unbound curing in that process. And so – go ahead, Yaron. Yes. Maybe as a quick follow-up and I know you can’t say a lot, so maybe just share what you can – what do you see as the various scenarios of what might happen next from your vantage point, especially as these drugs are moving away from EUA to getting official approvals. I am talking about the COVID, obviously. Yes. Thanks, Yaron. And again, I appreciate the question. We saw the – from Moderna approval earlier this quarter, obviously, an important step for their programs. So, it’s hard to comment on anything specific in terms of what next steps look like. But I would say nothing has changed from any of the prior discussions we have had on this in terms of how we are thinking about it. And what I will say is, again, we are looking forward to providing more updates on Genevant in the near future. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Yaron. Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. Number one is on tapinarof. Can you please give us a sense of your confidence level launching a psoriasis drug during COVID? And perhaps internally, what may constitute a good launch. And perhaps while you are at it, comment on what consensus numbers are for calendar year 2022. And then my second question is regarding the Moderna litigation. So the press release and your presentation and Mike’s comments on the strength of Genevant, but the really good next steps and interestingly, the 10-Q mentioned specifically, Genevant may commence litigation at any time to enforce these patent rights against infringers. And I believe that is a new disclosure that wasn’t in prior 10-Q. So, can you just please make some comments as to what you are perhaps waiting for, or if I can reframe the question, what are some gating factors preventing Genavant from moving forward with litigation? Thank you very much. Thanks, Dennis. Thanks for listening, and thank you very much for the questions. They are both good questions. So, I will start on tapinarof. So, in terms of our level of confidence about the launch our level of confidence about the launch during the pandemic. So, first of all, I think you heard it the patient satisfaction data. I think you have heard it from Todd, on the sort of last quarter of this call, and other circumstances. We are very confident about this drug. The treatment effect is significant. The durability and remitted benefit is significant. So, we see a ton of opportunity. I think as I have said before, the drug is both optically in our comparison is more effective than, and we think more tolerable than the current sort of first-line capital standards of care, especially portico steroids. So, we see just a big opportunity for patients. And so it’s hard not to feel confident about the launch. Obviously, there is a lot that goes into a launch of a product like this, including getting pricing and access right, getting out to the docs. These docs have been writing portico steroids prescriptions for a very long time. And so making sure that doctors understand what tapinarof can do, understand how to use it with their patients. I think those things will take time, that education is important that sort of work with that physician community is important. I am highly confident that we will be able to do all of that. And obviously, at medical conferences and similar, we have already been able to talk about the data that we have generated, and we are looking forward to continuing to engage with the dermatology community. So, I think we feel good about the launch, and we feel good about the timing of the launch. I think it’s an important year in psoriasis, generally. Obviously, we are not the only product launching. There is another topical launching. There is a new systemic therapy launching. So, there is a number of other programs. I think there is going to be a lot of focus and interest in psoriasis. And we feel good about getting out in the second quarter of this year, and we feel good about what we think we are going to be able to deliver. We haven’t given specific revenue guidance, and I am not going to do that right now. But looking forward to showing you what the drug can do over the course of this year and next. So, that’s what I will say on tapinarof. On your Genevant question and I apologize, I can’t comment too much on the specifics here. Our 10-Q disclosures, and you highlighted one of them are accurate, and we don’t have a ton to add in terms of – beyond what it says in those disclosures, but it’s obviously something we are paying a lot of attention to and looking forward to sharing more as soon as we can. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi and good morning. So, maybe as we think about the tapinarof launch, can you just help us understand kind of the market access and your strategy there? What percentage of target live should we expect to see? And how can you get – like how quickly should we expect to see that market access kind of to place on the approval? Yes. So thanks, Corinne. That’s a great question. And again, appreciate I appreciate you asking it. In any – obviously, in any therapeutic area, honestly, it’s not just dermatology, but I will say especially in dermatology, market access is an incredibly important dimension. The patient experience at the pharmacy is an incredibly important dimension, making sure that patients and providers and pharmacies all know how to get patients on drug is important. There is a lot out there for us to learn in the market around what this looks like, including from the ongoing launch of Opzelura at Incyte where they have obviously been paving the way in terms of a novel topical in the markets. In general, we are focused on a pretty balanced market access approach. We will have an industry-leading – we have a co-pay program. We will contract with national and regional health plans. We’ll contract with third-party payers. We are hoping for unrestricted formulary reimbursement. And we just think with the efficacy and the durability of the drug, as well, frankly, as with the overall current treatment landscape and with the fact that for the first time novel topicals are really offering an opportunity to keep patients on topical therapy and off systemic therapy in a durable lasting way, we think we should be able to have an attractive profile for payers. And so we expect to be able to deliver good coverage to the patient population. In terms of how quickly we are going to sort of get exactly that coverage or what we are ramping up towards and I think we are looking for broad coverage, but it’s important launches like this in our view to be relatively patient and focused around it. So, we will provide some more information about our exact expectations as the launch gets closer. But suffice it to say, we are focused on making the right decisions for patients on the product on pricing and on access. And I think we are going to be able to achieve a good mix. Thank you. And then maybe separately, obviously, you are going after more of a genetically identified strategy in MDS. But I am curious how frequently these patients are getting the muted genetic screening and how that could factor into both the clinical and commercial strategy you have here for RVT-2001? Yes. So, as recently as a few years ago, not that many people were checking for SF3B1 mutation, but it’s actually become one of the main diagnostic criteria for RS-positive and RS-negative patients with lower-risk MDS. So, it’s actually – it’s a very commonly screened for mutation at this point. So, we should be able to see it in most – we should be able to see the status of an SF3B1 mutation in most MDS patients. So, it should be a good test. And then the other biomarker, the aberrant TMEM14C transcripts is a little bit of a lower and less common biomarker, but it is still checked relatively often. And so we should be able to screen forward and selectively roll forward in a useful way. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. Your line is open. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on some of the questions on tapinarof, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a sense of how we should expect kind of the general pace of the launch to kind of proceed through the year? If you can kind of talk a little bit about also what metrics do you expect to provide on earnings calls in the future once the drug gets launched, that would be great? Thanks. Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks for the question. And I appreciate the focus here on tapinarof, it’s obviously exciting for us. So, we are looking forward to it. So, in terms of the sort of shape or pace of the launch, I guess I would go back to what I said a couple of comments ago, which is we are looking for a meaningful change in prescriber behavior here. So, I think you got to start with that. These docs are very used to writing topical therapy, so that’s good. But they are very used to writing corticosteroids, and that’s going to require some reeducation. And so I think this is going to be a build. I think it’s going to take some time and energy to really sort of change the behavior. And I think the exciting thing is we are building to a really interesting level because we get to look out, and change the paradigm, which is not something we get to do very often. So, I think it will take a little bit of time to build that market. And I think we are sort of committed to doing that in the right way and starting to bottoms up and educating the physicians and working on the access piece that we talked about before, so that we reached the maximum number of patients with the product over time, and we get sort of the right kind of sustained use of the products. In terms of metrics, I would expect we are going to share the kinds of things that people share with similar launches. So, we will talk about our engagement. We will talk about, obviously, strip rates over us for that. And we will be keeping an eye on payer coverage on gross to net things of that sort as the product gets launched. But in general, we are really looking forward to just getting out there and getting out to patients. Got it. Thanks. Our next question comes from Doug Tsao with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just, Matt, maybe stepping back as you referenced at the beginning of the call, you have $2 billion in cash. Obviously, the equity markets have been a challenge for healthcare for last several months. I am just curious, has that affected how you are thinking about business development and potentially your sort of use of capital or capital allocation strategy? Yes. So, thanks for the question, Doug. I really appreciate it. And it’s front and center on my mind. This is the answer. I think it’s got – for any biotech company right now it’s got to be front and center on your mind to make sure that you are doing the maximum amount possible with the resources that you have got. And we are extremely privileged in our capital position, and we know that, and that privilege is particularly acute in markets like this ones. So, we are doing everything that you would expect in terms of making sure that we are allocating our capital extremely carefully and focusing on the areas where we have maximum possible impact for patients. And frankly, we are also doing everything we expect in terms of looking out across the marketplace for opportunities to take advantage of our relative capital strength. Obviously, it’s not a position that everybody is fortunate enough to be in, and that creates opportunity for us. I think you see it in our past in-licensing activity, you will see it in our future in-licensing activity. I think we are really focused on value. The MDS program obviously came as plenty of capital. And so it wasn’t exactly the same situation. But a program where we were able to acquire it very efficiently because we saw a different possible application for it, I think you will see things like that. We have another new Vant that we have mentioned by name, but I haven’t described in detail prior Vant, which has another new program that, again, was a modest upfront relative to the size and opportunity of that program. So, I think you will continue to see us be opportunistic. I think you will continue to see us deploy capital in focused, targeted ways where we think we can differentially bring something in efficiently. And in the meantime, I think you will see us be very disciplined in how we use our cash so that we can maximize the application of our resources to opportunities that matter. And I guess as a follow-up, I mean, I asked a different way. Matt, historically, the company has been very active from a business development standpoint from an in-licensing standpoint and partnerships. Just curious, do you think just sort of going back to my comment about sort of the broader market does that change your thinking? And perhaps just outright M&A become more attractive just given current market valuations and dislocation in the marketplace? Yes. So first of all, we haven’t necessarily shied away from M&A even in the past. So, our degrader platform was acquired as Oncopia. We look on therapeutics last year. So, where we see good value, we have always been happy to do that. And I guess – same as everybody else, I think it’s been harder for us to find good value on the M&A side in the last couple of years, because of the way the market has evolved. I think that’s changed significantly. And so I think there is absolutely an opportunity for us to take advantage of that. Being a public company, obviously helps, although those are all relative value considerations, and we look at our own valuation as well. But absolutely, yes, we see opportunities for M&A and increasingly attractive opportunities for M&A after the sort of macro change in valuation that we have seen over the past couple of months. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Matt for closing remarks. Great. Well, look, thank you again, everybody, for listening. Thank you for all of your questions. It was great to hear everybody’s focus. And obviously, we also are incredibly focused on tapinarof, and incredibly focused on that launch coming up in the second quarter. So, looking forward to getting back on the phone in the near future to talk more about that, to talk more about updates elsewhere across the business and in the meantime, thank you, everybody, for listening and excited to have shared this – our second quarterly earnings update as a public company. So everyone, hope we got a good weekend and have a great day. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Welcome to the Roivant’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s conference is being recorded.
I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host today, Stephanie Lee. Please go ahead. Good morning, and thanks for joining today’s call to review Roivant’s financial results for the company’s first quarter ended June 30, 2023. I’m Stephanie Lee with Roivant.
Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, CEO of Roivant and Mayukh Sukhatme, President and Chief Investment Officer for Roivant. For those dialing in via conference call, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investors.roivant.com. We’ll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow a along.
I’d like to remind you that we’ll be making certain forward-looking statements during today’s presentation. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you, everybody, for joining this morning and for listening. It’s only been a short – actually 6 weeks since our last call, as our last call was for the K. So comparatively a little bit tougher updates, but an exciting – certainly an exciting quarter ended June 30 and a lot to talk about today.
I’m going to give just a brief – a brief sort of update on the state of the business as well as an update on the quarter and VTAMA sales. And then actually, what we’re going to spend the bulk of time on today is we’ve been getting more questions about brepocitinib and we’ve actually got some new data there in Crohn’s disease. So we’re going to share that and talk through again a reminder of sort of how we’re thinking about that program as we approach the lupus data in the back half of the year and more beyond.
And so with that, I’m going to get started just starting on Page 5. As an overall reminder, we continue to be pleased with the progress we’ve made in the business. During the 6/30 quarter, we completed our tenth consecutive positive Phase III trial that was the during – during 1 study, the second study of VTAMA which we continue to be proud of that track record, which has now led to 6 FDA-approved products across Roivant and the Sumitomo collaboration.
As of 6/30, we had just under $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Which, as we’ve guided before, comfortably funds us into the second half of 2025 with a lot of clinical data, both generated recently and even more coming in the near future. And we’re very proud of our pipeline at this point. We have – we think is among the strongest I&I pipelines with by our estimate, over $15 billion in peak sales potential supported by VTAMA, but also a number of critical first and best-in-class programs behind it.
On Slide 6, and it’s funny because this is a relatively, as I said, a quiet moment. But 2022 has been, and I expect will continue to be an extraordinary year for us as a business. As a reminder, up until now, in addition to continued progress on the VTAMA commercial launch, and we’ll come to that in a second.
We’ve generated positive data in now both large randomized controlled studies, Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis for VTAMA, which, as we’ve said before, we’ll support our filing for additional indication there at the beginning of next year an approval hopefully next year as well. And then we’ve also now put out 2 important data sets 1 in January and 1 in June, demonstrating the efficacy and our overall enthusiasm for RVT-3101 antibody, which obviously has gotten a lot of discussion. That program is obviously one of the most important in our pipeline.
Now we are currently underway with our Phase II Crohn's study and in the midst of preparations for our Phase III study in ulcerative colitis, which we will share more detail on in the near future. Still coming for the year are 2 pretty important events. One, which I expect we’ll get some questions on.
I know Immunovant has spoken a lot about recently, is the upcoming single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose data for IMVT-1402, our next-generation ATF antibodies at Immunovant. Obviously, that data, we think, has the potential to show that we have a a best-in-class program there, and we’re really looking forward to putting it out.
There’s a number of other data sets in our FcRn franchise and sort of more broadly in the FcRn field coming in the near future as well. And then as I mentioned, the topic on which we’ll spend the most time this morning is brepocitinib. We had – that’s our dual inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1 pride event.
That program has its – what would be 1 of 2 registrational studies in SLE, a Phase IIb study reading out in the fourth quarter of this year. And actually just a lot going on generally there as well, and it’s a program that I think is just starting to get some attention, but it’s really sort of earlier on people’s rate are.
So all of that situates on Slide 7 in our late-stage pipeline, which again, we are very excited about in terms of its breadth and in terms of the importance of many of the mechanisms we’re working on. And again, the remaining programs in that pipeline, like namilumab and RVT-2001 that are earlier stage higher SKU opportunities that we’ll share more about as we get data, which will happen sort of starting at the end of this year with 2001 and beyond within milanab.
So with that, I’m just going to go into a brief update on where we are on VTAMA, starting on Slide 9. So look, we continue to be bluntly very excited about the progress that we are making here. We continue to see monthly scripts increase. We continue to see docs enthusiastic. We continue to hear a lot of enthusiasm for our AD data.
We continue to make payer progress, as I’ll talk about in a moment and continue to see improvements in revenue, which is ultimately the bottom line at the moment. So we’re just very pleased with the growth there. We’ve got now over 11,500 unique prescribers who have written over 200,000 scripts, which is pretty extraordinary for just over a year on the market.
It’s a really strong start from our perspective. On Slide 10, I just want to give a sort of payer update. So we’re up to about 130 million lives covered just a tick under 80% of commercial lives, plus 87 million government lives. This is the kind of coverage we dreamed of having maybe 18 months after our launch, this is really exactly where we need to be from a government perspective. We are on formulary with all 3 of the major PBMs.
So we’re in good shape from a major PBM perspective. We have 4 additional national health plan formularies. We have a bunch of progress across some of the regional and smaller plans. We are integrate place and recovery perspective. And the other thing I’ll say is the significant majority of this coverage obviously has no prior off, that’s a little bit of a red herring in dermatology where very few drugs are true prior off, but most importantly, the majority of it is single set through steroid with a very easy process for that step to be achieved.
And so we feel really good about the strength of our coverage, and we think it’s underpinning successful commercial model. You can see a little bit more about that on Slide 11. We did $16.7 million in net revenues for the quarter, which continues to be a solid progression in growth quarter-on-quarter, feel good about that growth and expect to continue to see it to accelerate with both volume and gross net improvements in the future.
Gross to net was a hair better, 26% yield over the last quarter. We had pulled, as we said on the prior call, some of the GTN improvements from this quarter to the June 30 quarter back into the 3/31 quarter with some earlier formulary additions.
So I expect CGTN to progress sort of linearly on the trend line over the course of the year, and I expect to end this fiscal year, call it in the mid- to high 30s from a yield perspective and still believe very comfortably we’ll be on a trajectory to get to that 50% yield that we and others have guided to as we progress.
So the contracting and sort of other payer progression is all sort of moving exactly in the direction we needed to, and we think we’re in a good shape from a GTN perspective, so that’s about it on VTAMA for now. I’m sure we’ll get some more questions.
Look, I think the continued progress there is is exciting to us, and we’re excited about all the feedback we’re getting, we believe script volumes will continue to increase over the course of this year, especially as our now live DTC campaigns begin to have an impact on volumes. And we’re really also looking forward to getting going in AD next year, which is, as you may remember, a about 4x larger market opportunity where we have some truly exciting and highly differentiated data.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over in just a moment to Mayukh, who is going to do a relatively deep dive here on brepocitinib, RDUinhibitor PK2 and JAK1. And I think it’s a program that that has been high on our minds, but a little bit below the line for others just because of everything else going on in our pipeline. But it’s a really exciting program. It’s a very potent agent, which continues to demonstrate strong clinical efficacy.
And one of the many reasons we’re highlighting it today, which may well talk about as we generated some data Pfizer had an ongoing study in Crohn’s disease that’s read out and once again, the agent has shown great promise in another clinical study. We are unlikely, as you know, to progress it in Crohn’s disease. But nonetheless, really excited about the data there and what it means for what we’re going to do in some of these other places.
So with that, let me hand it over to Mayukh to take it away, starting on Slide 13. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes – so yes, please turn to Slide 13.
So as Matt said, I want to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about one of, I think, what I consider one of the sleeping giants within our portfolio. To the extent that brepocitinib is going to get some notice for investors, I think it’s mostly through the lens of being a pivotal study catalyst for Roivant by the end of this year. And while that is true, we do have the lupus data later this year. I think the lupus story is just a small part of what we’re trying to build with brepocitinib. And so I want to go through that story of fresh here today, the punch line, from my perspective, is don’t sweat on brepocitinib.
So put simply, brepocitinib is a unique, highly, highly active dual inhibitor of both TYK2 and JAK1 that has already shown spectacular efficacy in a broad range of auto immune diseases. So as Matt said, we’re reporting here for the first time the sixth consecutive positive Phase II study for brepocitinib this time in Crohn’s disease, which is a study that is being run by Pfizer and [indiscernible] expense. And that adds to the string of positive Phase II studies already reported, now covering as you see here on the slide, psoriasis, alopecia, toric arthritis, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis to pertiva and nacho disease.
And we’ll go through the rest of the material on this slide in greater detail later, but we think that we really have the potential to become the leading oral therapy and loop given the dual inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 should provide greater efficacy than inhibition of either one alone. That is a large global study that is designed to serve as 1 of 2 registrational studies. And importantly, it is a 52-week study with a 52-week primary endpoint, which is the registrational endpoint that has historically been the most predictive of future studies.
Our ongoing single Phase III study in dermatomyositis, which will serve as the basis of an NDA filing shortly asset data, is coming up, to the extent that it now seems a little far off. I think as we round out the year and are sitting in the first half of 2024, it will come into focus as a near-term catalyst ever. And that’s just the beginning for this program.
So we think that, that unique dual mechanism and high demonstrated efficacy of brepocitinib really creates the pipeline and a product approach where we can own a series of specialty rheumatology indications, each of which has high unmet need and blockbuster revenue potential for brepocitinib, and we’ll show that in the coming slides. And then finally, we have a long IP runway here with protection to at least 2039.
Please turn to Slide 14. So as many of you know, the JAK family consists of 4 IsoPol JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAK family inhibition has proven over the past several years to be an enormously powerful mechanism for treating a wide spectrum of autoimmune disease.
While the field has accumulated approval starting in rheumatology and moving on to a [indiscernible] as you see across the top, the underlying biology often remains complex and stubernly irreducible. Soon here is a simplified schematic detailing a number of key cytokines that have been shown to drive pathobiology of autoimmune disease along with the key JAK isoforms responsible for mediating those signaling pathway.
While early JAK inhibitors were relatively nonselective more recently in the field has trended towards more specific inhibitors with JAK1 having the broadest applicability and therefore, unsurprisingly, the first to be explored. You can see here in the dark blue band across the middle or JAK1 inhibitors such as RINVOQ and the cytokines that are most directly impacted. Notably, selective JAK1 inhibitors are able as a press signaling of IL-6 and interferon gamma, two important cytokines linked to autoimmunity that are not suppressed to selective inhibition.
Now the TYK2 selective inhibitors, such as the TYK2 now coming out of the scene in a particular set of indications. They cover a different set of cytokines, which you can see in the light blue on the right. Key among these are IL-12 and 23. The latter of which drives the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells and downstream IL-17 reduction, a key pathogenic driver of many auto immune diseases.
Now both JAK1 and TYK2 approaches are accumulating a track record of meaningful clinical benefit and commercial success across a range of disease. RINVOQ is already approaching $1 billion from net revenue per quarter, and Sotyktu also projected to be a multibillion-dollar product. But in spite of their many successes, both of these medicines also have their limitations. Sotyktu, for instance, failed outright in both ulcerative colitis and crowns, while RINVOQ has produced lackluster Phase II data in both lupus and NHI.
We see this at least in part connected to the underlying bio. While some disease may be well treatable by selective JAK1 or TYK2 inhibition loan, many others involve multiple inflammatory pathways and may require intervention across multiple orthogonal [indiscernible] to see maximum effect or maybe even to see a meaningful effect at all. The latter is especially true for heterogeneous highly inflammatory diseases, which have high patient burden for clinically meaningful efficacy to date and limited.
So that’s what drove our original high pots at Roivant, that the field in its current state may not be slowly maximizing the power of JAK inhibition that efficacy might be getting left on the table in certain indications with highly specific TYK2 or JAK1 inhibitors. So in our search for the right molecule to prove out this hypothesis, we unsurprisingly ended up partnering with Pfizer, probably the company with the longest history and deepest experience with JAKs in the industry.
In brepocitinib, we found a highly active, safe and well-characterized molecule with a novel mechanism perfectly suited for what we are looking to do. Simultaneous inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1, which we can uniquely accomplish with brepocitinib creates 2 distinct opportunities to deliver differentiated efficacy. For diseases driven largely by Type 1 interferon signaling that is to say interferon alpha and beta, a dual hit on both sides of the heterodimer shown in the bottom in page, second from the right and schematic on the slide.
May allow for greater suppression and thus potentially greater efficacy as compared to hitting TYK2 or JAK1 alone. And second, diseases with broad cytokine involvement that include, for instance, to IL-6 and B-cell pathways on 1 hand, and IL-12/23 and the IL-17 access on the other may actually be treatable with brepocitinib in a way that would not be possible to either JAK1 or TYK2 inhibition. So that’s the core hypothesis stated in the bottom line. Brepocitinib will deliver best-in-class efficacy in indications mediated by the TYK2 JAK1 diver and in diseases requiring broad cytokine coverage.
Please turn to Slide 15. So what concretely drove our excitement of brepocitinib? So to start, when we looked at a series of standard cytokine inhibition assays, we saw exactly what we hope to see.
So shown here are the results of studies run internally at 5. The left battle looks at type 1 interferon signaling, a key driver across multiple autoimmune diseases and one where both TYK2 and JAK1 inhibition would be expected to have an effect. That’s exactly what you see experimentally with NICE inhibition by the leading pure JAK1 inhibitor and NICE inhibition by the leading 2 inhibitor.
And then importantly, Pfizer’s experimental data showed that brepocitinib is able to suppress type 1 interferon signaling as well as or potentially even better than either RINVOQ or Sotyktu. This is exactly what would have been predicted in the prior slide. We are benefiting from the double hit and thus achieving a greater inhibition of type 1 or brand signal.
On the right, we show 2 other critical cytokine drivers. So on the top right, we see Type 2 interferon, interferon gamma, which is mediated by JAK1 but not by TYK2. So the pattern of inhibition is again, what you’d expect. You see that RINVOQ and brepocitinib, which both inhibit JAK 1 have a relatively higher degree of inhibition of interferon gamma compared to a selective TYK2 specific inhibitor Sotyktu.
And then on the bottom right, you see the opposite performance from the single isoform drugs on a cytokine inhibition assay for IL-12 and 23, both of which are TYK2 and not JAK1 median. Here you see a nice inhibition by the Sotyktu, the TYK2 inhibitor, while the action of RINVOQ is much more modest. Again, that’s exactly what we’d expect based on the schematic we showed in the prior slide. And again, we see that brepocitinib is a very, very unique TYK2 mediated cytokine outperforming to TYK2 in this asset.
The conclusions here, let’s at the bottom. On the left, you can see the brepocitinib should achieve greater type 1 interference suppression and as possible by targeting either TYK2 or JAK1 alone by virtue of the dual hit. And on the right, brepocitinib can reach sufitulate in a single molecule for cytokine suppression profile of both the leading TYK2 agent and the leading JAK1.
Please turn to Slide 16. That cytokine vision experimental data has translated well into a string of Phase II data readouts to date. As you can see, oral brepocitinib has demonstrated an extremely consistent pattern of meaningful clinical efficacy in every single indication tested.
Efficacy results for alopecia, caricarthritis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis and HS were all statistically significant and consistent with as good or better than any other small molecule inhibitor. The HS data, which I’ll cover later, was a relatively recent readout that occurred subsequent to our taking over the drug from Pfizer.
We’re also excited to be reporting today the induction results of a large global Phase II Crohn study run by Pfizer. So I’ll provide some additional details in the following slide. Finally, we have another major benefit in the clinical package for brepocitinib. We know what we have on safety as well. So we know that stacking both TYK2 inhibition and JAK1 inhibition does not apparently lead to a safety profile that undercuts the efficacy advantages that we hope to show.
Our extensive safety database now consists of over 1,400 patients exposed across 20 different Phase I and Phase II clinical studies for up to 64 weeks. And what we’ve seen is a well-characterized safety profile in line with approved JAK family inhibitors.
Please turn to Slide 17. So we’re pleased to report today the top line results from the induction portion of a Phase II study with repository Crohn’s disease. This is 151 patient global Phase II study. The primary endpoint was the SES CD50 and the key secondary endpoint was the clinical remission rate at week 12, defined as a proportion of patients who achieved a CDAI of less than 150 both endpoints were highly initially significant.
We think that actually the true efficacy might have been understated on the SES-CD50 in the study as there ended up being a slight imbalance in baseline severity between the arms which made it harder to achieve that endpoint for the drug arm.
That imbalance would not have an impact on the secondary end point since the way that, that endpoint is calculated only takes into account patients to start with a baseline CDAI of greater than or equal to 220. The point line here is that this is a trial that I’m sure it wasn’t on any investor’s radar and yet has delivered really strong efficacy.
In fact, that 33.5% placebo-adjusted delta on clinical remission, which is used as a co-primary endpoint in registrational studies and is particularly important for prescribers is, in fact, the highest seen in the late-stage study from any drug oral or biologic to date.
Please turn to Slide 18. So we find ourselves in an enviable position. So we have a highly efficacious molecule that has strong biologic and clinical translation in a variety of large market indications. There are lots of things that we could do with brepocitinib, but our vision with brepocitinib from the start was to really focus on those indications where we could deliver a step function improvement in outcomes for patients, generating maximum impact for patients and maximum return for our investors.
To that end, we ask ourselves what are the disease indications where the unique properties of brepocitinib really shine. For us, that came down to a few simple considerations laid out on the left side of the slide. So in the light blue and moving clockwise, the first where is inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1 required for maximal efficacy.
Here we look for biologic rationale for dual TYK2 JAK1 inhibition and corresponding clinical validation. Second, in dark flu, which indications have extremely high morbidity and mortality, creating a need for novel therapies that provide a meaningful efficacy benefit. And third, in pink because the indication has few available treatments, including no approved oral therapies.
And finally, of course, we need to be confident that we could run an efficient experiment, minimizing development and regulatory risk. Put those together, and we think that there’s an opportunity for brepocitinib to become a leading treatment option in a series of large and uncoded markets. The next two slides will go into more detail on the [indiscernible]. But remember, that’s just the beginning.
Please turn to Slide 19. Dermatomyositis is a large orphan indication with a very similar profile to indications like PAH and cystic fibrosis where oral small molecules have become $1 billion plus products. Over the past 30 years, dermatomyositis has become much better understood and characterized in the medical community, an increasing disease awareness and diagnosis has led to higher incidents and proven estimates over time.
We’ve done our own analysis with claims data from 2016 to 2020 and estimate that the U.S. adult pavilion sits at 37,000 patients, consistent with recently file estimates as well. So we’re looking at a patient population that is already clearly in the large orphan category. This is not an ultrarare indication. And as awareness and diagnosis of the disease continues to increase we expect the number of patients to grow over time.
For an autoimmune disease of acting this many patients, dermatomyositis presents a strikingly high disease burden. There is high mortality with some estimates of up to 40% at 5 years. The characteristic skin rash is shown on the right, cover large percentages of the body and lead to significant pain in addition to disfigurement. The vast majority of patients also suffer from proximal muscle weakness, which can severely impact daily living activity. Many patients end up meeting walkers or wheelchairs. Finally, a meaningful proportion of patients suffer from intertial lung disease.
In sum, this is a high mortality, highly inflammatory disease which covers multiple organ systems and will evolve into a large commercial market. On top of that, there have been no NCEs approved in the past 60 years, and there are no oral therapies in industry-sponsored late-stage development.
Steroids, ISTs and IVIGs have been used in for many years, with the latter recently gaining formal approval. But again, there is not a single modern drug approved for the indication and the current treatment options present high safety and convenience burdens in addition to limited benefit. IVIG, for instance, requires multi-hour infusions for 3 or more days every month and is associated with side effects, including quite a high rate of thrombotic events.
So we really CDM as one of the major unmet needs in all of autoimmune disease and an opportunity for a modern targeted therapy, particularly in Oral one to enter the market and rapidly become a blockbuster products. And while a number of companies are exploring small proof-of-concept studies, there are very few drugs in late-stage development and no oral therapies in Phase III, other than brepocitinib.
So looking ahead to a product launch of brepo in this market in just 3 years, we think this has the potential to become a material commercial driver for Roivant as we think about the overall sales across our pipeline over the next 5-plus years.
Please turn to Slide 20. We also see this as an indication where the case success for Bret is very high. With no modern medicines approved for DM, the physicians often experiment with various different therapies to add on to corticosterone, as a result, to investigator-initiated studies in an extensive body of case report. There is meaningful clinical validation for JAK1 inhibition in DM. This aligns with the pathobiology of the disease which is driven in large part by type 1 and type 2 interferon signal.
Given no other JAK1 inhibitors are approved or an industry-sponsored development for DM, even if REPO just matched this level of efficacy that was set us up well for clear commercial success but there’s also reason to believe that the addition of TYK2 inhibition can further add to the benefit that brepocitinib will provide, both to enhance potency of type 1 interferon suppression.
As well as through suppression of IL-12 and 23, which are also involved in pathobiology. Please turn to Slide 21. Given the high unmet need in our high competence poor success, we took the bold step of moving directly into a Phase III program that involves a single registrational study.
Our expectation is that this study, if successful, would support an NDA filing for brepocitinib in DM. The single Phase III study is already well underway, tracking to complete enrollment in 2024 with data and a potential NDA filing in 2025. This time line has us clearly positioned to be the first oral to market by potentially several years and likely also ahead of a few biologics and later stage development.
One idiosyncratic consequence of our decision to move directly into Phase III, is it means that our next catalyst in DM won’t be coming until 2025. But that catalyst could be a major inflection point for Roivant a business. with a potential $1 billion-plus product line immediately to fall.
And given this launch would be in an orphan indication with a specialized prescriber base, we would expect the revenue ramp to be significantly steeper than for a volume product like VTAMA. So as you think about modeling P&L over the next 5 years and beyond, we think this is a major first additional value that investors right now may be underappreciated.
Please turn to Slide 22. DM is the first of many orphan indications where we see a similar opportunity for brepocitinib not talk about a few more of those in a bit. But first, I want to talk to the other indication where we have an ongoing pivotal study where we do have a major catalyst coming up later this year, and that’s lupus.
So lupus is a disease that everyone does well in that and is one that’s gotten an increasing amount of attention from industry in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of patients suffer from lupus in the U.S., many with serious and defeating disease.
Only two therapies have approved – been approved in the past 20 years, both injectables and as a sign of how desperate the field is for occupancy, Enlist is doing greater than $1.4 billion in U.S. revenue despite very modest efficacy at between 9% to 14% placebo-adjusted SRI-4 and SEFNELO, which launched recently is projected to be a $1 billion-plus product despite mixed Phase III data. One study didn’t show fiscal consistence while the other showed about 18% placebo-adjusted SRI 4.
Please turn to Slide 23. The limited options reflect an unfortunate reality everyone no Well, lupus is simply a very challenging disease to treat. It’s highly heterogeneous with multiple interconnected inflammatory pathways, acting on T cells, B cells and interferon signaling and multiple impacted organ systems. To date, most attempts to treat me this involve a molecule acting predominantly across 1 of these 3 acts.
Enlist, for example, deplete B cells, while Senal suppresses interferon signal. Both have generated meaningful but ultimately somewhat modest efficacy. And of course, there’s a long history of sale attempts at individual cytokine inhibition, indicating bitocytokine suppression diseases as well.
Through JUUL, TYK2 and JAK1 inhibition, brepocitinib is distinctively optimized to address all 3 axis simultaneously. TYK2 modulate T selected IL-12 and the IL-17 A17-axis to IL-23. The JAK1 arm migrates B-cell activity to IL-6, IL-7 and IL-21 and both are enforced together to maximum suppress pathogenic type in or Ceron signal.
Please turn to Slide 24. Over the past 18 months, we’ve had readouts from 3 JAK inhibitors in lupus, including Phase III data from illumin, a JAK1, 2 inhibitor Phase II data from LINGO, the JAK inhibitor and Phase II data from Sotyktu TYK2 inhibitor. These data provide clinical evidence for the therapeutic relevance of each of JAK1 and TYK2, respectively.
In lupus and as such, increased our confidence in brepocitinib’s positive effect. At the same time, none of these molecules have demonstrated particularly some selling benefit with the high water mark so far being Sotyktu to if you blooded across and roughly the mid-teens placebo-adjusted.
This is what we might expect, given that unlike brepocitinib, none of these molecules directly targets all 3 inflammatory actives and lupus. So we are cautiously optimistic that through dual 62 and JAK1 inhibition brepocitinib can deliver greater efficacy benefit than we’ve seen from these other oral therapies and become the leading oral therapy for patients and physicians.
Please turn to Slide 25. We continue to expect top line results from our ongoing study of brepocitinib in lupus in the fourth quarter of this year. As we’ve stated in previous earnings calls, this is a large global study using the registrational 52 we primary endpoint and as such, it is designed to serve as 1 of the 2 registrational cities. In the event of a positive outcome, we would expect to rapidly initiate a second confirmatory registrational study.
I do want to emphasize that while we’re cautiously optimistic that brepocitinib can deliver data that will position it as the leading oral therapy in lupus, our confidence in the project success here is not as high as in dermatomyositis.
We feel rock solid that we are hitting the pathways that matter, but we, as an industry, have had mixed success in proving out efficacy and regulatory end points such as SRI Lupus is just a challenging indication in that respect. And it was not the core bet that we underwrote when we in-licensed refract.
That bed rather is the opportunity in dermatomyositis in the string of other large orpediations potentially fall and given the 6 successful Phase III placebo-controlled studies we had to date, our enthusiasm about brepocitinib in these other indications will remain irrespective of our results in lupus.
Please turn to Slide 26. Turning now to these other indications. I just want to highlight 2 in addition to dermatomyositis where we have a rapid potential path to market with launches that could follow closely behind DM.
A couple to highlight here are noninfectious guidance or NIU NHS.
Please turn to Slide 27. NIU, like dermatomyositis is a large orphan indication with a very high disease burden with approximately 30,000 cases of legal blindness attributable to NIE each year. Unlike DM, there is one approved targeted therapy, HUMIRA which has generated over $0.5 billion per year in sales despite limited efficacy and almost no indication specific promotions.
The development stages competitive landscape in IU is even more wide open than in DM with no ongoing Phase III studies at this time for any oral or biologic an efficacious oral therapy could easily match HUMIRA’s peak sales in this indication and with sufficiently compelling data, we could potentially do significantly more.
Please turn to Slide 28. As with CM, we also have clinical validation of JAK1 inhibition and NIU. Before filgotinib development was discontinued in the U.S., it has generated Phase II data in NIU suggesting JAK1 inhibition may be more efficacious than TNF alpha suppression by HUMIRA. However, the extent and robustness of clinical validation of JAK1 inhibition in NIU is not quite as great as in DM. And so in this indication, rather than moving straight to Phase III, we are conducting a quick proof of concept to.
This study also ensues dose ranging that would make a potential pivotal study even more efficient. We’re excited to report that this study is now fully enrolled with top line data expected in the first quarter of 2024.
Please turn to Slide 29. HS follows a similar pattern to DM and NIU, a highly debilitating disease with a large orphan prevalence increasing over time through increased diagnosis and awareness. Here too, HUMIRA is the only approved targeted therapy with indication-specific sales of approximately $3 billion per year, again, despite limited efficacy and limited indications to stick promotion.
Please turn to Slide 30. Unlike DM and NIU, HS does have other oral therapies in later-stage development, specifically 2 JAK1 inhibitors. As you can see on this slide, the pace recently generated by brepocitinib is great and placebo-adjusted benefit than that seen from either of these molecules.
Brepocitinib benefit observed in Phase II also surpasses the 42% growth and 16% placebo-adjusted benefit in its Samira Phase III program. Notably, brepocitinib benefit was robust. It caused both TNF naive and TNF refractory patients and was generated despite the study being heavily impacted by COVID-related discontinuation.
In fact, the placebo-adjusted benefit among completers was actually 27%, suggesting an opportunity to potentially demonstrate even greater benefit in Phase III than Phase II. This is further supported by HS pathobiology, which involves not only JAK1 mediated inflammatory pathways, but also the clinically validated IL-23 17 axis which is suppressed by TYK2 inhibition, but not JAK1 inhibition.
Please turn to Slide 31. So I hope I’ve been able to convey in some small part, how excited we are about the potential for brepocitinib. It’s a highly active molecule with a unique mechanism of action and long patent life that sets us up to potentially create the leading oral specialty autoimmune franchise in the pharmaceutical industry. Here on this slide, you see how this pipeline and a product will build in the coming years.
The successful lupus readout later this year clearly tees up a multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity in business alone. But even without lupus, we have a rapid derisk path to $1 billion-plus commercial launch in DM with full enrollment of our pivotal study coming next year, data in 2025 and a potential product launch in 2026. And then there’s a rapid pipeline of other large orphan indications to follow, each with blockbuster potential, a pivotal program in HS and NIU or both could be initiated in 2024. And we have other large orphan indications to follow with potential proof-of-concept studies planned for 2024.
With that, I’d like to thank Ben Zimmer and the rest of the private team for all their work on brepocitinib so far and of course, to our colleagues at Pfizer for both partnering with us on this program, and of course, for all their work in discovering the compound and generating this really rich data set. And I’d also like to thank all the investigators, site personnel and importantly to patients who participate in these trials as well. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Matt. Thanks, May. Appreciate it. And obviously, thank you for that a deep dive into the program. some questions we’ve added, but I also just want to set people up for the months and frankly, years ahead with it. So looking forward to more there. I’m going to go very quickly through the rest here and then open up for Q&A in just a minute or two.
Starting with – on Slides 34 and 35. While we’re not going to spend any time today on the C18 data, it occurred to me as we were finalizing this presentation, the June 30 quarter was the quarter in which we had generated the 36-week maintenance data that it felt – it felt we were not to at least add to that extraordinary data set. So we’ve had a couple of calls on that topic so far.
The TL1A program is an incredibly exciting opportunity. And we continue to look at the state and find new things to like about it, including the continued improvement into 56 weeks and some of the things that set us up really well for the Phase III program. So more on that to come.
As a reminder, on Slide 36, we are now underway, including first patient dose with our Phase II study in Crohn’s. The goal here is to get, as I’ve said before, dose ranging out of the way prior to beginning Phase III in a way where when we look at all of these time lines and stacking together, we think we still have an opportunity to be effectively first-in-class in Crohn’s disease by going quickly from this study – into a Phase III study in Crohn’s. So we’re very excited about the opportunity for TL1A in Crohn’s in addition to UC and look forward to sharing more data next year when the study concludes.
And then lastly, on the late-stage portfolio on Slide 37. I talked about this a little bit at the beginning. Obviously, we collectively likely to minivans are going to have an opportunity to get back together in the next couple of months to talk about updates on our FcRn franchise.
Most notably, we are expecting imminently within the next – I think unmanned September for the single-ascending dose data in October, November for the multiple sending dose data. Data that we think will validate the best-in-class potential for INVD1402 or our next-generation anti-FcRn.
As a reminder, the hope there is to show that we can continue to suppress IgG to a best-in-class level while also avoiding the impacts on albumin and LDL that have been seen with etokimab. It’s been a busy year for the FcRn field.
And the other thing I’ll point out is that we just recently saw data from a competitor efgartigimod in CIDP, which was really great data that both continue to underpin and validate the SGR mechanism. It’s now worked – basically everywhere, it’s been studied and showed a potential in a new market, including 1 where we have an ongoing Phase IIb study of a relatively similar design to the one that just read out, we’ll have some top line data from that study.
Next year, and then the last thing I wanted to briefly shine a spotlight on to on Slide 38 is just we continue to make progress on our various discovery efforts. I’ve got a slide here on Vanti, which is a rapidly progressing effort that we have to use certain advanced machine learning techniques, specifically on induced proximity and protein degradation.
One note here, we had previously had a number of efforts in this area, including one at Protevance, we’ve now effectively collapsed the protease proximity effort into Vanti and have sold the balance of our Protein shares to our partner SK. And so Van is now the sort of instantiation of our principal bed at Rosendin base proximity and protein degradation, and we are really excited with the early progress there, including some great hiring.
Notably, we’ve now got Michael Bronstein, as anti scientist. He’s one of the – really the lions in the field of molecular modeling using machine learning. And so we’re really excited to have him on board and some other great hires there as well, but we’ll talk more about soon. Real progress coming, and we’ll get back on the phone as we’ve got data to share, but keep an eye on this space as it were.
So I’ll wrap up very quickly on Slide 40 with brief financial update. Financial picture continues to evolve as we expected. Revenues and so on, we’ve talked about cash, most notably good into the second half of 2025, as we had discussed before and continuing to keep an eye on that and on managing it across our portfolio with various opportunities coming soon.
So with that, I will – I’ll stop. Slide 42 is the catalyst map. We’ve talked about some, but not all of these things coming and just an exciting balance to 2022 ahead – sorry 2023 ahead. So I’ll say thank you to, Mayukh, to the team and to everybody, including patients and investigators who help make this quarter what it was.
And I will turn it over to the operator to open the line for Q&A. Thank you, everybody. [Operator Instructions] Now, first question coming from the line of Brian Chen with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question this morning and walk through on Brepo. Maybe first on Brepo. Given what we saw from other JAKs in SLE specifically, – how confident are you that Brepo can perform better than Ducros specifically in SLE. Is there anything that you would want to flag from the baseline characteristics in the ongoing Phase II design to ensure that you can show the differentiation and also make sure the placebo rate low. Then I have a follow-up. Yes. Thanks, Brian. And maybe I’ll take one second to that question and then also hand it over to Mayukh, to see if he’s got further comments. Look, I think in terms of the confidence in SLA, and I think you heard Mayukh said, on the one hand, I think there’s a strong biological rationale that hitting both TYK2 and JAK1 should provide a meaningful benefit.
And so I think that’s – that’s an important point. And then I think the second important point is understanding the bar correctly. And I think if you look closely at the Duke data, look, I’m not going to say Duke is not an impressive agent. But really, I think the way to read that data is probably sort of mid-teens blended efficacy. And I think if you look at the 3-milligram dose where they showed something more impressive in that I think there was a pretty significant sort of patient population imbalance that suggests to us that the mid-teens is really the bar to beat.
As far as the baseline characteristics, I think, first of all, as a reminder, this is a study that Pfizer designed and run. We think it’s a pretty well-designed study, and we’ve been watching it closely. There were certain things that we didn’t control. And as Mayukh mentioned, with lupus is a scary indication for trial execution.
But we feel, overall, pretty good. And I think that our study design, for example, was designed to try and flag some more severe baseline criteria, which has historically correlated with success, but we’ll obviously see how that plays out later this fall. Mayukh anything to add to that? No, no. Not really so Matt, I think you nailed all the points or to make. And maybe just one more follow-up on Immunovant 1402 data coming up next next month. Just to prep us for the top line coming up. Can you walk us through how we should gauge the profile at top line in terms of one IgG supression compared to etokimab and Far and more importantly, the impact on albumin and LTL, given the potential variability in the LDL assay. Yes thanks, Brian. Great question. Obviously, when we’re getting a lot right now, and I’m sure Immunovant getting a lot too. I think Immunovant spoken a fair amount on this point publicly. I think the – on IgG suppression Look, we believe we have an equivalently potent molecule here, and we’d like to see equivalently deep IgG suppression as a short answer. Remember, comparing apples-to-apples versus as close as we’ve got equivalent time points and things like that.
But in general, I think we’d like to see really the same level of deep energy suppression and certainly, we’d like to feel like we’re going to be able to supress ITG comfortably deeper than efgartigimod can. So that’s on the IgG suppression points. On albumin and LDL, obviously, there’s a lot of speculation and discussion on this point. The facts are that the variability of the albumin assay is about 5% and the variability of the LDL assay is 10-plus percent.
And so I think within first fractionation with relatively small studies, you want to be comfortably within both of those smaller is generally better. And my sense is that if the albumin impact in the SAD is relatively modest, that the LDL will follow and because of the variability in the LDL, it will be easier to see – you’ve got a few weeks of compounding data after multiple injections.
So I’m mostly looking to the albumin in the SAD data. I haven’t seen really any of this yet, so I can’t say what it’s going to look like, but that’s what I’m keeping my eye out for. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Mayukh. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from the line of David Risinger with Leerink. Your line is open. Good morning. Thanks very much, Matt and team, for all the updates. So I have questions for both Matt and Mayukh. Matt, could you provide an update on the evaluation of potential monetization of assets and also provide an update on the pursuit of new product acquisition opportunities. And then I’ll pause and follow up with a question or 2 for Mayukh. I appreciate it. And I figured we would get some version of that first question. Look, I think we are in a privileged moment in terms of the amount of clinical data we have generated and will generate soon. That data is both deeply informative to our own strategic future and also exciting to potential partners, acquirers and so on. And it’s flattering to be the focus of attention. It’s made me wonder a little bit how exactly public speculation happens. But anyway, flattering.
Look, I think the short answer is on the monetization side, we’re value-oriented, and we’re going to have to make these decisions carefully, knowing that a number of our late-stage programs are really rare opportunities with huge potential. And so we don’t take any decision on them in either direction lately with the dollar sums at hand being very large and the unit for patients being very large.
Certainly, I wouldn’t expect us to make any decisions of substance on this point until we started to get some of the Immunovant data in just because that’s a pretty important strategic catalyst for us as we think through what the future of Roivant could look like across the rest of our portfolio.
On the new opportunity side, I will hand that over to Mayukh actually. But I guess the one thing I’ll say is this has been a phenomenal asset sourcing opportunity environment for us. Obviously, a year ago today, we would not have been talking about PLA. We also wouldn’t have been talking about IMVT-1402.
We hope we’ve proven that we see some pretty interesting and unique things and that we can bring them in. And I’ll say we’ve got things on our racket right now. that are just as exciting to me bluntly is anything in our late-stage portfolio. And I hope we can convert some of those. And the next year, we’ll be talking about them as well. But Mayukh, anything you’d add to that? Not really, Dave. I mean, look, I think that this is – as Matt said, this has got a our sort of normal course of business to be out there looking for new and high-value things. I think that work is ongoing. I feel really good about, as Matt said, things that are rated. Stay tuned. And then just a follow-up. So Mayukh, thanks for providing the comprehensive vision for brepocitinib. Could you discuss the decision not to pursue a number of indications despite compelling results, including Crohn’s and then if you could also discuss Sotyktu’s inverse dose response in SLE and whether there are any potential implications for Brepo in SLE or no? Sorry, I missed just the last part of that question, Dave. So yes. So on the last part, the slide shows an inverse dose response for Sotyktu-NSLE. So as the dosing went up for Sotyktu, the efficacy went down – just wanted to see if you had any comments on that and whether there may or may not be implications for REPO as a dual agent in SLE as it’s dosed up. And as I understand it, you’re testing 15, 30 and 45-milligram doses. That’s right. Matt, do you want to take the indication question? Yes, sure. I mean, look, I think, Dave, it comes down to – and this was sort of the inherent thesis in REPO as well. I think at the moment that we acquired Replfrom-Pfizer, it was sort of just in the thick of the sort of turning point on JAK inhibitors because of labeling.
And I think our view has been in the face of very compelling data, as you point out, in Crohn’s and a number of these other indications, that the competitive landscape there is such that the JAK labeling may be a disadvantage difficult to develop through. I think if you take Crohn’s, for example, I think that’s an interesting question in the sense that clearly, as we continue to study RINVOQ in IBD pretty aggressively and also the Aster TYK2 have struggled a little bit there.
So I think we’ll get some more data on that later. I think we’ll continue to reevaluate those questions. That said, I’d say the other thing about our view is, I think with the data that, frankly, the TL1A class is putting out in IBD, we’re not sure exactly where Jack will fit in the future treatment paradigm understanding the obvious benefits of being oral.
But anyway, look, I think the affirmative bet we’re making here is that orphan indications where the Jack liabilities won’t be a problem with the unmet need is highest is sort of the place where it makes the most sense for us to pursue for us to pursue REPO. Yes. I mean I think just to add to that. Look, I think we’re always going to be, I think, kind of dynamic in our evaluation and really sort of this sort of comes down to you in a certain sense, an embarrassment of riches in terms of just the clinical data set and the breadth of potential indications we can go after.
I think as Matt said and articulated on the call, our sort of primary thrust as it were is in the orphan indications for which I think we feel like our ability to separate versus other options as great as the competitive intensity is leased, et cetera, and that certain really allows us to kind of have this specialty rheumatology and in that area for ourselves. And so I think we’ve got a lot of different – different options here.
And then I think you conceptualize over the next couple of data sets that we get in both lupus and NIU and the DM coming right at And term you question on Sotyktu. So look, I mean, I think obviously, this is sort of the – the sort of the inherent sort of uncertainty is around just relatively small and point estimates as well as just sort of lupus clinical trial readouts generally.
I think that our own view is that there’s not not really likely – the truth is not an inverted dose response in that Sotyktu study. I think there are reasons to believe that in essence this could be like a little bit of a reflection of just like slight imbalances imbalances between the various doses.
So for example, we think that the 3-milligram BID on the one that produced sort of highest print head more subjects receiving sort of triple combination standard of care baseline compared to other arms and then the 12-milligram once daily arm had higher dropout rates, et cetera.
And ultimately, if you look through sort of Sotyktu just generally, it seems like they’re quite close to saturation at the 3 mgs – there’s not really kind of like a true reason to believe that they’re sort of more juice in there at the higher basis. And then finally, it seems like mid-teens kind of blended across these 3 values – it seems to be consistent with how Bristol themselves seem to be powering a Phase III as well. Got it. Thanks very much. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate your questions. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Hi, guys, and thanks, Mauk, for doing all the work for me on lupus and Brepo, a fantastic presentation. A question on capital allocation. First, just on Brepo. When you think about how – whether it’s spend more on these orphan drug indications, can you just remind us of the Pfizer agreement? And how much they – if there’s anything to contribute and then bigger picture, you talked about making capital decisions after seeing at least initially some of the data from 1402.
And you’ve got so many moving parts just this year and next year with many drugs and decisions you’ll have to make. Like can you just walk us through how you’re going to think about that? Would you start thinking about that after sad?And how long would it take you to come up with a game plan for what you’re going to do for Roivant for spend? Yes. On the first question on repo specifically, the answer is the lupus study itself was very heavily subsidized by Pfizer. So our cost there was a fraction of the total study cost. And that obviously made it an attractive setup for us. The rest of the costs associated with other indications are ours to be or Pfizer does not contribute they’re protected from dilution of their 25% stake up to $1 cap, frankly, relatively similar. The mechanism at Telavance with the GLA program.
So in terms of other orphan indications, NIU, DM is all our costs, et cetera. Those are capital allocation isn’t for us the same as any other but SLE, in particular, has been highly subsidized through the end of this current study. If we decided to run another study, that would also be ours to fund.
More generally, I guess I probably – in so far as I said, we wouldn’t think about it until we saw the Immunovant data that was probably an overstate. Obviously, we have spent a lot of time thinking about capital and capital decision-making as we explore the opportunity set, and I agree there’s a lot of moving pieces coming. I think that data will be informative. I think the MAD data will be informative.
I think we’re going to learn other things from the FcRn field including some RA data from J&J, from our home grade study, et cetera, through the balance of this year. I don’t know that there’s going to be like a single tipping point obvious moments where before which we can’t make any decision and after which we can, I think it’s more of taking the facts as we have them and trying to understand in which direction things swing over the coming months.
That said, we have the best version of this problem, I think, in the sense that we just have lots of different options for capitalizing the business going forward. And so I think we’re just – we’re frankly picking on good choices at this point. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks, Robyn. I appreciate the question. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my questions here and congratulations on all the progress this quarter. So I wanted to ask you on brepocitinib, one thing people have been asking us is how you think about pricing if the drug is approved? And I know it’s a little bit early, but if you can’t talk about specifics, maybe you could tell us the bookends and how you’re thinking about it and what you might comp it to.
And then on TA the reimbursement work you did on psoriasis, how much can that be leveraged to the atopic dermatitis opportunity so that you can move quickly on uptake on that one? And then one more here on brepocitinib. Can you be a little bit more specific on when this year, we’ll see the data? Is it early, mid, early fourth quarter? Yes. Thanks, Louise. On the 2 repo questions on the timing. I think it’s safe to assume mid- to late fourth quarter is probably the way to think about that. On pricing, I mean, I’ll hand it to Mayukh, but I think my short answer to that question is at this point, there’s a pretty wide breadth of possible indication spaces between SLE and DM and so on. So it’s probably premature, but I’ll hand over to Mayukh. Yes. I think the punchline is we’re thinking about this principally as sort of a, call it, an orphan drug pricing band given the sort of indication set and sort of what makes sense I think that, that is potentially compatible with pricing and leases as well if efficacy data is really strong. And then on the meta access question, I think the short answer is yes, that is a lot of that work can be heavily leveraged, and I would expect to be sort of process with payers to be significantly streamlined given that we’re all on formulary.
Obviously, there is still work to do. It’s not like it’s instantaneous and automatic but I would expect it to be a faster, more straightforward and frankly, much more predictable process where have – look, I think there were some real unknowns about how coverage was going to materialize this prior to our launch. And I think at this point, we are pretty confident that we are going to get comfortably covered with reasonable rebates by the payers. Thanks, Louise. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Dennis Ding with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I just had one on Immunovant. So on the upcoming 1402 data, can you just remind us the study design and how long is the follow-up for Sat and Madden Interestingly, how often is albumin being measured and as a follow-up, maybe given your comments around the assay variability and that there could be different time points on which albumin is measured and just also appreciating the fact that human reductions can go up and be down at some point and others. And I was just wondering what are some – what’s a good outcome for you guys in SAD and the MAD on the albumin front. Yes. Thanks, Dennis. I appreciate these questions. And obviously, it’s an area of a lot of focus, so it makes sense. Look, I think on study design, there’s a fair amount about this in the minivan corporate deck and in ours as well.
On the SAD study, it’s 6 1402 plus 2 placebo patients. I forget exactly how far that it’s measured, but it’s at least a few weeks. And then on the MAD study, it’s 10 1402 and 2 placebo patients and it’s weekly dosing for 4 weeks and again, with a several week tail at the end. We’ve got pretty frequent data points, I’d say, as a reasonable benchmark if you went and looked at like some of the etokimab data we’ve put out, I’d say like the measurement points are pretty similar.
And so early – in fact, we follow these patients out, sorry, a lot more than a few weeks. And there’s sort of a number of measurements within 10 days and then it starts to get a little bit more spaced out in the SAD study. So again, there’s a fair amount of data in event deck on this point.
In terms of what good looks like on albumin in the Sat in the Mad against the backdrop of smaller is better. I think, again, with a 5% variability in the assay, I think we hope to be comfortably within 5% and I’d say any of the agents, frankly, that show a 5% or less impact on albumin seem to be pretty well set up from an LDL perspective.
So I think it’s Hard to say exactly how things would sort of compound from the SAD study to the MAD study, but in general, I’d say, lowers better within that 5% bar is probably what I’m looking for. Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Ding. I appreciate the question. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Karen Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Good morning. This is Craig on for Karen. So as you referenced earlier in the call, this can be a pretty tricky indication – so on that, what do you view as the bar to support continued study in the indication? In SLA, you said, yes? Yes, that’s right. Yes. Look, I think the way we are currently thinking about the program, understanding that it’s kind of a balance of the factors is Duke is the bar to beat given that they have the back cleaner TYK2. This would count as 1 of 2 pivotal studies, we believe, if successful. So the data from here would already make it onto the label. It’s 52-week study. So it should be relatively predictive of a future study as well, given the way that it’s set up.
So I think we have the best possible setup understanding that there has been some complexity in SMA trials before. In terms of the bar, I think it’s a balance of the factors, but I think you’ve heard us say that we think is a mid-teens drug. And you’ve heard us say that we’d like to be better than Sotio.
So I think that gives you sort of some indication for where our head is at, but we’re going to have to look at – there’s multiple multiple endpoints and things like that. So I’d say mid- to high teens sort of – and whatever that trend looks into across the other places to look. Got it. That’s helpful. And maybe just a quick one. You highlighted for the first time that you’ve achieved payer coverage with government covered lives. I guess how should we think of the, I guess, doctor adoption of these patients following this update? Is it going to be a similar timing as the commercial coverage lives – you’ve kind of highlighted it’s around 6 months in the past? Yes. Look, the truth is that the psoriasis market is sort of 80%-ish commercial anyway. So even though we’ve got a lot of covered lives there. It’s a smaller chunk of the patient population. Index. So I think now that we’ve got coverage, they’re government patients, they’ll sort of accrue over time to better GTN yields and so on.
I think in general, I just expect to see steady improvements in GTN from here on out as we get closer and closer to that 50% bogey over the next 12 months and beyond. And I think the government lives will contribute to that, but I don’t think it’s sort of going to be like there’s some kind of step function specifically associated with the government lives. Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking that. I have a couple of questions on brepocitinib brepocitinib. And just remind us, AA, Lupica areata, what are your plans sort of with that indication – and then secondly, for HS, can you file – can you just conduct one pivotal? Is that sort of sufficient? Or do you think you need to?
And then I guess, finally, at what point can you present or as far as you’re going to present the data from the studies. I mean, the studies are positive, obviously, I’m talking about Crohn’s and HS, but just so we can also understand the overall profile safety-wise. I mean there’s obviously a lot of data out there just so we see the full data. Yes. Perfect. Look, I think the first answer is on alopecia, we have no like current plans to progress in alopecia. That’s an interesting indication. Our data looks promising, but our view is sort of the same as for the other slightly larger indications.
So I think not sort of on our near-term road map, but obviously, with the quality of the data we have, we’ll be watching everything. On the other questions, first of all, on HS specifically, look, I think it’s it’s premature. We haven’t sort of discussed it with FDA in detail or anything like that. We don’t have a concrete plant in there.
So I’d probably rather not boxes in on a particular study design. That’s probably what I’d say there. anything else you’d say in terms of the other points or you may be sort of slightly closer than I emptier publication time lines. Yes. So I think not too much more to add. I think that one study in particular still has a maintenance portion to cover on warlook forward to being more at a future medical meeting. And then the HS study actually has been published at this point. So we can [send that to you your own]. Pfizer’s got discretion on the publication of crunch. Yes. Thanks, Yaron. I appreciate it. Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Douglas with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Hey, Doug, you might be on mute. Can you hear me now, Matt? Sorry about that. Yes. Perfect. Okay. Starting with the TAM, I’m just curious, as you have – you successfully added to the coverage for the product. Do you anticipate making any changes to the sort of co-pay card or the sort of access program, consumer access program as it is now. or do you anticipate waiting until getting approval in AD before making any changes? Yes. Thanks, Doug. It’s a great question. Look, I think for the moment, we have no immediate plans to change the co-pay card. – sort of set up in a way, as I’m sure you appreciate to work well for us as people migrate from uncovered to covered. And unlike some of the other parts that were set up initially, some of our competitor programs or the new topicals have like 10 programs or whatever, where the uncovered side of the card was low in order to attract trips at a time when coverage was spottier.
We always had a slightly higher co-pay on the uncovered side. it was frankly set up to carry us into the AD launch and beyond. We evaluate this stuff constantly. And our focus right now is the high prescribing docs feel really great about the product and what we’re really focused on is taking the back to right 2 scripts a month and turning them into 510 script a month box.
And I think the sort of goal of whatever changes we make would be to sort of keep that process in motion. But the short answer is, I think the copay card actually works reasonably well. To be honest, if there’s something I think we’re sort of working on, it’s – I think at this point, the actual quality of coverage is better than the perception of coverage I think these docs have been burned a fair amount historically on challenging coverage in derm.
And we actually have quite good coverage. It’s easy to obtain many, many of their patients, as you can see from the presentation will be covered. I think many derms frankly, have not like caught up with that reality yet. And so a lot of the educational work we’re doing is just trying to make sure people understand that picture as well as we can possibly help them understand it. And Matt, you sort of touched on another point, I’m just curious your perspective on how do you – or what’s the plan right now to sort of help accelerate the writing from sort of your low prescribers, right? I mean, because it sounds like your script base is fairly concentrated.
And obviously, to sort of take it to the next level, you’re going to need to increase that debt. What are the things that you’re able to do to get people to go beyond just writing that first initial script? And – and are you aware of what is keeping them from online in just a couple of scripts right now. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Look, it’s a great question. It’s quite literally $1 billion question. So we spend a lot of time thinking about it. I think the short answer is we’ve already taken certain steps. We’ve got now DTC was something we were pretty conservative about up until we got to the sort of good payer coverage position.
So within the last month or we’ve really sort of started to ramp up the DTC campaign, and that should take months more to really fully sort of make it into the script volumes but it’s something that we are watching to drive volumes that way. There’s other things too. There’s one property is these patients don’t go to the doctor very often.
And so frankly, if you were a – if you were a hyperdrive dermatologists, you’ve been waiting for the VTAMA launch for many years, if you were a leading dermatologist is sort of showed up maybe you wrote a few test scripts or you write a few test scripts every month, but you actually haven’t seen very many patients back in your office, who you put on VTAMA a year ago. And so I think one thing that works in our favor is just time. It’s just back sort of seeing repeat visits from patients who they put on earlier in the launch.
And I think that will cause a compounding effect for us. And then we continue to sort of keep our ear to the ground and work on whatever the questions I mentioned, the coverage question is probably one of the most important messaging questions that we’re working on right now is just helping docs understand that which isn’t like other topical, but it’s going to make a difference for their patients, and it’s going to be easy for them to use in a way that some of the other historical launches have been more challenging.
And so I think that’s where a lot of our focus is. I’d say in the dock call that I’ve been closest to, frankly, the number one point is this payer coverage point is just doctor a little gun shy about where things are on the payer side. But we hear other things that we continue to work on.
And in general, I think doctors are familiar with the product, we’re pretty happy to be using it. So we’re just trying to get everybody else to build some experience in muscle memory. Remember, these stocks write steroids in their sleep. So it just takes – it takes some time. But we’d love to see faster. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Thanks, Doug. Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions in the Q&A at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Matt Glen for any closing remarks. Great. So look, I just want to say thank you to everybody for listening this morning. Thank you to our team for all the work this quarter and beyond. I’m really looking forward to the next couple of months here, and we’re going to have some important opportunities to get back together.
And yes, thanks all, and have a great rest of your summer, and we’ll be back here soon to talk about some more exciting updates. So thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for listening, and we’ll talk again soon. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","the first quarter 2023 earnings conference call is being recorded . all participants are in a listen-only mode after the speakers' presentation . today's conference call will review the company's financial results for the company’s first quarter ended June 30, 2023 .",0.0

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stephanie Lee. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to discuss Roivant's financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, our Chief Executive Officer.
For those dialing in via conference call, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these results on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I'd like to remind you that we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation. that reflect our current views and expectations, including those related to our financial performance and the potential attributes of our products and product candidates. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC, including the earnings release and the Form 10-Q filed this morning for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and risks -- and related risks and uncertainties.
We will begin with Matt Gline, who will review key business updates and provide a financial update. We will end the call with a Q&A session.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, [ Steph ], and thank you, everybody, for joining this morning.
I'm pleased to present our third fiscal quarter financial results for quarter ended December 31, 2022. Yes, thank you, I'm excited to go to get together.
This will be a relatively shorter update because, frankly, we've had a very busy quarter. And so we've taken a few opportunities to get together. It's hard to believe, but actually, it was after we last had a quarterly update call that we in-licensed and then published data for RVT-3101 as well. We've preannounced certain of our fiscal results last week when we did a financing, or 2 weeks ago. So again, thank you, everybody, and looking forward to sharing some updates and in particular, have some interesting updates to share around the commercial launch of VTAMA.
So I'm going to start out just quickly on Slide 5, reminding everybody because it's still early in 2023. We are very excited about this year. The year started off strong for us [ in ] the announcement of our RVT-3101 data, the data for our anti-TL1A antibody from the induction phase of our ongoing Phase IIb study.
We expect a number of really important updates from across the business, including -- we'll talk more literally today about continued reach and payor coverage of VTAMA, which we expect over time to translate, over the course of this year, and to continue to improve gross net yields and scripts.
We can now say both the ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 atopic dermatitis studies are fully enrolled, and we expect to share top line data from those studies from ADORING 2 in March of 2023 and ADORING 1 in May of 2023. So important data from our AD program coming very soon, which is [ exciting ] as it opens up the market -- we'll talk a little bit more about this, 4x the size of the market where we're currently in psoriasis.
We expect data in the first half, right closer to the middle of the year [ than ] the beginning, from RVT-3101, our anti-TL1A antibody, from the chronic dosing period of that trial, the 52-week data, which we think is important data. We think the first time anyone's reported meaningful 52-week data for an anti-TL1A antibody. So we're looking forward to sharing that full data set when it's available.
In the middle of this year, as I know many are watching, we will have human data from our next-generation anti-FcRn antibody IMVT-1402, which will, if successful, leave us with -- we think the best anti-FcRn franchise in the category, at least potentially the best with 2 drugs, both with maximal suppression of IgG as well as IMVT-1402 potentially no impact on [indiscernible].
And then finally, among the major announcements in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to produce pivotal data from 1 of 2 potential pivotal studies in brepocitinib in SLE, our dual-inhibitor TYK2 and JAK1, which really has the potential to be some of the best data as we talked about before, with what we've seen in SLE. So excited to share that data when we've got it.
So with that, I'm going to start today with an update on the commercial launch of VTAMA, which we continue to be just incredibly excited for. And I'll start on 7 with just a brief review of the financial results. Some of this, as I mentioned, we disclosed last week, a near doubling of revenue for the quarter, with revenues now at $9.2 million in our second quarter launch. And one thing I'm particularly happy to report, we've seen already early improvements in our gross to net yield from 12% in our first quarter of launch, up to 18% in the quarter just ended. And I think -- and we'll talk about payor updates in a moment. I think with continued payor updates, we expect to see that number continue to improve over time here.
We are really happy with the continued level of patient and physician demand for the product. We continue to get great feedback more or less across the board, and the demand really had a -- as you'll see a positive impact on our ongoing payor conversations. So yes, really excited about how that launch is going and excited to continue to share updates as we get into [ that in the calendar year ].
On Slide 8, we continue to be the #1 branded topical. We have been since our eighth week at launch after a little bit of choppiness around the holidays. We're excited to see return to growth, and we are optimistic for the trajectory from here as we look forward. And yes, just really excited with what the script volumes mean for patients with doc enthusiasm and payor enthusiasm.
But perhaps equally -- and I showed this slide pretty often on Slide 9 because I think it's a great slide. This is really just the beginning for us, right? In the most recent disclose IMS -- most recently disclosed IMS, we did about 3,800 scripts, which is a great number for this stage of our launch. But remember that even in psoriasis alone, there are 90,000 topical prescriptions every week, of which the vast majority are topical steroids.
And once we get our atopic dermatitis data and have access to that patient population, there are a little over 300,000 atopic dermatitis prescriptions every week, again, the vast majority of which are topical steroids. And in psoriasis, our data conclusively, in our view, establishes us as both more efficacious with a remitted benefit than topical corticosteroids as well as meaningfully safer and better tolerated.
So looking forward to sharing that profile on atopic dermatitis and looking forward to continuing to push the dials and levers that will allow us to grow into those very, very large opportunities.
It's been a quarter of solid execution for the Dermavant team. As I mentioned before, both atopic dermatitis trials [indiscernible] are fully enrolled. And again, with those readouts expected, the first one, ADORING 2 expected in March 2023 and ADORING 1 expected in May. So important clinical data coming. And we continue to expand high quality formulary access.
And maybe I'll just provide an update on that on Slide 11 as well. First of all, I'm pleased to say, at this point, we have 57% of commercial lives covered for VTAMA. That's close to 95 million lives, that includes an addition of 1 national PBM formulary, 2 national health plans, 1 regional PBM formulary, 8 Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and 1 national PBM that actually lifted its new-to-market block ahead of a review so that we have good coverage across [ those lines ]. So these in many cases, are decisions being led by the medical teams of these payors who are so enthusiastic about the medical profile of VTAMA and what it offers to patients that we're making really, really good progress on coverage.
I have a couple of examples that on Slide 12, I think, sort of drive home the point around quality of coverage. And I'd say, look, multiple factors have driven this progress, including a ton of patient and physician demand; and payor judgment, as I mentioned, in the medical teams on front of the clinical value -- overall prescription value volumes, a lot of hard work from our team. Some representative examples. One of the major PBMs lifted the new-to-market block and requires only a single step edit to a topical or a Vitamin D. Another major PBM added us to formulary and requires a step through 2, either a topical steroid, Vitamin D or a combination.
A regional PBM has added VTAMA with no restrictions, edits or steps at all. So in effect, sort of on parity with generic steroids. Two national health plans cover VTAMA with a step through any 1 -- sorry, any 2 of the four most common topical therapies. And many regional plans cover VTAMA as completely unrestricted or with a simple steroid look back. And I'll add -- and this is a small plan, a small regional plan so far, but there's 1 small regional plan that actually covers us ahead of other recently launched branded topical competitors and has us as a preferred product.
And the last thing I'll say about sort of how pleased we are around the payor discussions here is, we're really -- not only are we happy with the coverage overall, we are consistently covered at parity or better than our topical competitors. And that's important because you'll remember, there was a fair amount of discussion early on around different pricing strategies and a question around, which pricing strategy was going to drive better access. And we are now very happy to report that our pricing strategy and market access strategy has achieved really high-quality coverage, and we are definitely plan by plan, PBM by PBM at no disadvantage and in some cases, are at an advantage overall. So really, really happy with the payor progress here.
As far as how this progresses, some of our competitors have shown good progress in analogous indications from a GTN yield perspective over time. I expect to show the same. Candidly, the first quarter of the calendar year is sometimes a little bit more difficult because of deductible resets. So I think you'll start to see more progress coming second quarter and beyond, but really excited for those developments and things that we're going to head towards an attractive commercial P&L, as we've said before, and I can now back that up with -- give broad coverage in an understanding of the economics of those contracts.
So I'll stop there on VTAMA, but I'm sure I'll get some questions on it in the Q&A and move on to clinical execution. So first of all, just as a high-level sort of observation on Slide 14, we are really excited about the inflammation and immunology franchise we're building here. We didn't set out to build an I&I company. And in fact, we have a number of interesting opportunities that go beyond I&I. But at this point, we have multiple new approvals and 10 -- more than 10 Phase II or III data readouts coming each year -- multiple data readouts, including readouts, registrational readouts coming each year between now and 2025. So massive progress over the next couple of years.
Obviously, we talked a lot about the 2023 data earlier. That leads, from 2025 beyond, to a wave of potential additional approvals across large I&I indications with high unmet need. And we think building towards an I&I franchise that has $15 billion or more in aggregate peak revenue potential. So just a huge opportunity for us. And remember, this spans FcRn and TL1A, and our TYK2/JAK1 franchise as well as VTAMA and other programs behind that. So we think this is one of the most exciting biotech I&I franchises, and we're excited to build this forward, and we're excited to see lots of interest from many different quarters of what [ we did ] this year.
You can see the late-stage pipeline on Slide 15. More familiar and have discussed many of these programs before. I was talking about VTAMA earlier today. We'll talk about RVT-3101 as a review of that data in a second. I'm not going to spend too much time beyond that in the portfolio today. But I will say we're excited for all of the updates coming this year and looking forward to sharing them as they come later. And it is really unprecedented, at least for Roivant, is the amount of high-quality important clinical data coming imminently for us.
So what I am going to do briefly, and I know many of you have heard this before, but it's an area that's been closely watched and [indiscernible] proud of it. I'm just going to review the data for RVT-3101 or anti-TL1A antibody just because it's actually -- it's hard to believe this, but we first put it out only a little bit over a month ago, and so it's still new to us and still lead to our story.
So as a reminder, RVT-3101 is a Phase III-ready anti-TL1A antibody which we are currently developing for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and plan to develop in other indications. This class and our agents in specific has delivered some data that we are really excited about it. It's extraordinary data. Some of the highest-end efficacy in an all-comers population that we were statistically meaningful with meaningful clinical benefit -- clinically meaningful benefit across all the doses we tested. We further were able to enrich response rates in a prospectively defined biomarker subset. Remember that our partner, Pfizer had run a Phase II study that had explored different biomarkers and prospectively identified a specific biomarker, was able to use a lot of data to optimize this choice of biomarker, which covers 60% of the UC patient population. And overall, we have a great safety and tolerability profile as well.
We think this should be the first-in-class agent potentially in large and well-validated markets. This is one of the largest Phase IIb studies ever run in ulcerative colitis. We have 300 patients dosed between this Phase IIb study and our Phase IIa study. And we have an important near-term catalyst that I mentioned before, our Phase IIb data coming in the first half of this year for the chronic dosing phase.
TL1A, on Slide 17, as a reminder, is a really cool mechanism that's got a pretty different mode of operation, where it's sort of a signal amplifier for a whole bunch of different important pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines. And so it's got a sort of multiple mechanism of action across that pipeline with impact on these different parts of the inflammatory pathway, which frankly both supports a little bit of the sort of quality of the clinical data and the unique quality of the clinical data we've seen as well as the safety profile. And given the quality of our data in UC encourages some real blue sky thinking with that -- with opportunities that are well beyond UC and Crohn's is a multiple inflammatory diseases as well as other fibrotic diseases, intestinal fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis. And as a reminder, Pfizer and their Phase IIa publications showed a meaningful impact on fibrotic markers associated with the drug.
So I just to remind everyone of the data on Slide 18 and 19, starting with -- look, just incredibly compelling activity, both for our agent and supported by data from a competitor across the class here. And again, some of the best gross efficacy seen and the best placebo-adjusted delta is seen across any class.  We showed a 31% gross clinical remission rate or 20% placebo-adjusted delta in all-comers at our expected Phase III dose or a 40% gross efficacy with a 30% placebo-adjusted delta in that biomarker population. Great data on endoscopic improvement as well. And then one of the data sets that we are most excited about on Slide 19 is that we were able to preserve that efficacy in the biologic-experienced patients population with our biomarker, which is always a very difficult population.
Most other classes of drugs fall over or have significant degradation of efficacy once you get into that patient population. Placebo population no longer respond in second line. And this is, in many cases, for patients, multiple second-line therapies, this is a sick patient population. This data opens us up to some really extraordinary possibilities, including given the breadth of our biomarker, an opportunity to become a real second-line agent of choice. So we're going to develop the drug for all comers. We're going to see nothing from a label perspective, but we are excited for an opportunity to develop this to help patients with our biomarker in second-line therapy. And all of this couples, on Slide 20, with just a really sort of remarkably no safety profile with almost every category being, frankly, less than placebo or certainly placebo-like at both the pool and our expected Phase III dose. And so you can see here a lot of data. We've talked about it before, so I'm not going to talk about it now.
I'll also have to take questions on it. We continue to be confident about the fact that, that profile will hold up both based on the preliminary inter-analysis and maintenance data we've seen as well as looking at the relationship with immunogenicity and our safety and efficacy when we see the placebo in relationship there.  So with that, I'm going to end the clinical and business update portion of this. We're not going to talk more about other programs today. I'm just going to give a brief financial update, and then we'll open the line to Q&A.
So a good quarter financially as we discussed. We had adjusted R&D expense, non-GAAP of $117 million or GAAP of $126 million. We had SG&A expense, again, adjusted of $116 million or GAAP of $168 million. And notably, the majority of that SG&A expense comes from Dermavant and associated with the launch of VTAMA. And then we have a very strong cash position that we continue to develop. We ended the quarter with balance sheet cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion or about $1.9 billion giving effect to the financing we did 2 weeks ago as well as expected to see the proceeds from the sale of the Myovant minority to Sumitomo Pharma, which we expect to complete this quarter. So look, that gives us, as we've discussed before, cash runway into the second half of 2025.
We are producing a tremendous amount of important clinical data during that period across all of the programs I've just mentioned. The financing we did a couple of weeks ago makes us -- gives us the ability to run a full speed at 3101, including across multiple clinical programs and I'm confident we will produce some important data for 3101 in only the other programs during that window. So really looking forward to sharing those updates. I feel happy with the financial position that we're in, proud of all the work that Roivant team has done over the last quarter, and looking forward to taking your questions and continue to provide obviously a bunch of updates between now and when we file our 10-K later this year.
So thank you, everybody. Thanks for the time this morning. And with that, after that brief session, I'll turn it over to the operator to go to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Cheng with JPMorgan. As we look into you're going to read out next month, what should we expect there in terms of efficacy at top line? And what do you think that we'll need to see to be commercially viable? Thanks, Brian. I appreciate the question. I appreciate your listening this morning. So thank you. What should we expect to see at top line? That's always a good question. We have not yet seen the data. Our Phase IIb data was really compelling. As you may know, we showed 49% gross efficacy on an IGA responder rate at our 8-week endpoint. I'd say there's a pretty wide range of what, good, could look like in that study. What I would say if we're in the 40s from a gross efficacy perspective, that's a grand slam for us. And if we're in the mid- to high 30s, I'd say it's a solid home run. And I'd say, anything in the 30s up would be commercially sort of viable for products given the quality of our data, the quality of our competitors' data, the quality of our safety data, et cetera. So I'd say stay tuned for what the actual data look like. But feeling excited about the opportunity and for a broad range of data that could be sort of commercially promising. Great. And maybe just 1 on VTAMA. I think we talked previously about the potential for our DTC campaign. I'm just curious what's your latest thought on the timing or the need to launch a DTC campaign here based on the trajectory that you see? And how important is it based on where you stand in terms of uptick? And are there any pockets of opportunities that you haven't fully tapped in yet for the VTAMA launch? Yes. Thanks. It's a great question. And I'll give an answer and then over to Frank to see if there is anything to add. Look, I think, first of all, we have some DTC efforts ongoing already. They are highly targeted in specific markets. They're using social media. We are excited about what we've been able to show there, but it's really the earliest days in terms of DTC strategy, and we haven't pulled out anywhere near to the level of stops that we could to sort of make this a thing. For us, we've been relatively conservative here because, in our view, it makes sense to drive DTC volume only as payer coverage really ramps up. So the patients who are sort of finding out about the drug are eligible for coverage when they go to their doctors. So we're still planning for that. Obviously, our sort of patient model is different than some of the systemic therapies that advertise very aggressively. But I think you'll continue to see us being thoughtful and use targeted DTC to drive volume. And I think we have a lot of opportunity from here to make an impact.
But Frank, anything you would add to that? I think that's a nice summary, Matt. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. This is Joyce on for Yaron. So our understanding about formularies are typically negotiated in the back half of the year and the fall and winter for the following calendar year. So I guess my question -- first question is, are you sort of all set with your formulary additions for 2023 calendar year or do you expect further additions?
And then my second question is just on the Crohn's disease indication for 3101. I think on clinicaltrials.gov, the original start date for that was around mid-'23. Is that when you plan to commence the study? Have you chosen the dose already? And are you potentially waiting for the chronic maintenance data from the UC study to select a dose? I will answer those questions in reverse order. So on the 3101 question on Crohn's, so there was a trial on ct.gov, that Pfizer had put up. That was a specific trial design that is not the study that we intend to run. And Pfizer basically decided not to run that study around the time they got a serious discussion with us in order to allow us to design a study of our choosing. We are preparing to share information about our Crohn's plan shortly, and we'll share it when we're ready. And we'll continue to share updates on our clinical plans overall for 3101 over the course of this year, including partially after the maintenance data has read out, and we've spoken to FDA about our Phase III plans in usage. So that's on that one.
I'll hand it over to Frank to answer the formulary question, other than to say, we are not done for the year, and we have some other major formulary additions that we expect to make imminently that would have a meaningful impact on that number. But Frank, I'll hand it over to you. Thanks, Matt. I think the -- what you said is, while generally true about industry structure, what we've seen with VTAMA, and the exceptional job done by our team there at Dermavant is the kind of remarkable patient and physician demand for the product has changed those cycles, changed the negotiation time line of those cycles and just generally led to a much higher degree of engagement across the board with those typical time lines largely not being a deciding factor for any of our access conversations. So we're really excited by that because I think it speaks to the fundamental value of the product bringing to patients and the community in dermatology. And just to read, I expect our covered lives to increase significantly between now and the next update we provide. Thank you very much for the question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Congratulations on a productive quarter. So I had a few questions for you. First, what I wanted to ask you is that I know we're expecting some updates in the anti-FcRn space, from some of your competitors, second quarter for CIDP from J&J, rheumatoid arthritis later in the year. How do you think those read-throughs will impact your thinking on your clinical development program? Yes. Thanks, Louise. It's a great question. Maybe I'll hand over to Mayukh if he's got a bunch after I say a couple of words. Look, I think, the really nice thing about FcRn as a target is that IgG has been a phenomenal biomarker for clinical efficacy. And so I think we will get a lot of information from any competitor readout that shows a relationship between IgG and clinically meaningful data. I think we'll learn more about how Nipocalimab's RA study was conducted and a little more about that when J&J choose to share it. Obviously, the world is watching the organic study very closely. One of the things, I think, would be interesting for us in that study, and the reason we're running a study of our own is because they'll -- that study is not going to inform us on what the impact of a higher IgG suppression would be simply because Efgartigimod can't suppress IgG at the same level as our agents can. So we're excited to learn more about dose ranging from our own CIDP study.
But obviously, there's a lot of interesting questions around the way FcRn works for that patient population, that we will learn from that study. So, at a high level, I think that data will be informative and there's probably other data coming, too. There was a data from a competitor and a small indication just a couple of weeks ago that was probably sort of new to the field and informative on yet another place which FcRn appears to work. So that's sort of at a high level. Mayukh, anything you would add there? Not really, Matt. I mean, I think as you said it, really the home run scenario for our program and our franchise overall is to see that there is sort of validation and efficacy from these other programs, but an efficacy picture that leaves room on the table for greater efficacy from our greater IgG suppression. Okay. And then can I ask you about Brepocitinib also on SLE. I know you have some data coming up. And just curious how it's performed versus some of its competitors such as baricitinib and Deucravacitinib? And what are you expecting would be considered a positive outcome for your studies? Yes. Thanks, Louise. It's a great question. Look, obviously, we're excited to generate the data from Brepo and SLE. Obviously, SLE has been a challenging indication. And so we're approaching it with a healthy amount of respect for that challenge understanding that Pfizer did a lot of the preliminary work and a lot of the execution on that study. That said, I think there's a lot of reason to be very optimistic here. For starters, you mentioned a couple of competitors, basically Brepo, as you know, is a dual inhibitor, TYK2 and JAK1. We have data about JAK1, you mentioned baricitinib in SLE, which was, I think, pretty good in Phase II and okay in Phase III from a top line perspective.
And then we have data from Deucravacitinib, which is a little bit variable, but also fairly impressive relative to the field in SLE. And then what we know is in cross-shop comparisons across other indications, and we have cross trial data with either bari or Deucra  in each of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and alopecia. And in each of those indications, Brepo has produced sort of numerically superior data across our comparison than either or both of the sort of stand-alone JAK1 or TYK2. This is kind of in line with how we think of Brepo, which is it's just a really big gun. It's a powerful drug that appears to produce sort of top end efficacy. And we think SLE is the kind of population where that could make a big difference. Mayukh, anything you'd add there? No, not really. I mean I think, look, BENLYSTA was approved in efficacy, but with an SRI-4 delta between 9% and 14% across all of its different studies. And in spite of that, it is a blockbuster drug, I think, just showing kind of the unmet need that is still remaining there, and we're looking forward to the results by this year. As a reminder, that's a 22-week study fully enrolled as of August. Okay. And then just 1 last really quick question. When do you expect to reach steady state for your gross to net for VTAMA? Yes. So we haven't provided exact guidance on that. It depends a little bit on some of the final payer discussions? And then as you've seen with competitors of ours, it probably takes 6 plus months for GTN to sort of really flow through from a contracting process. So I'd say I expect to see meaningful sort of step function improvements over the course of this year, especially as you get into sort of the middle and back half of the year. I'd say, it's probably the case that those last couple of -- like we'll see a meaningful set of movements. At some point, it will slow down a little bit in those last couple of percentage points of improvements getting us to true steady state, or it will take a little bit of time beyond that. I think payer contracting gets you 80% to 90% of the way there. And then the last little bit is other things, things like distribution costs. They're often sort of volume-based in their contracts. So those take a little bit longer to hit. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. So on the anti-TL1A, I appreciate you providing some additional color on kind of next steps and additional indications. But maybe can you just talk a little bit more about the breadth of indications that you see applicable for an anti-TL1A agent? And when we could see some updates on that front? And then just a follow-up to the last question on the gross to net. I guess any updated thoughts on what we should expect in terms of the long-term gross to net for VTAMA? So I'll take the second question first and then I'll start on the first 1 and probably hand it over to Mayukh for his thoughts as well. On the GTN question, we haven't given specific numerical guidance. That's been sort of a principal stance of ours because we are actively negotiating as you can see, with probably literally dozens of payers and regional plans and some PBMs and those discussions are all sort of active negotiations. That said, I will say, it seems like the field was sort of settled on a standard answer to the question of what a biotech company steady-state GTN looks like. And it seems like our various topical competitors as well as even things like Nurtec at Biohaven or whatever, all have sort of settled on a similar answer.
And so I would expect us to be kind of the same as everybody else of steady state, is the honest answer to that question. So TL1A in terms of breadth of indications, I think you can probably hear it from me, there's a lot of enthusiasm for where to go beyond UC and Crohn's. I think in terms of timing, look, we will share thoughts on our clinical plan when we're ready. And because of the competitive nature of that space, we're probably going to be a little bit careful about disclosing exactly when and what we're doing from an indication perspective. But, Mayukh, if you want to talk a little bit about the potential breadth there and how broad it could really go. Yes. Look, I think we're excited. I think we've talked a bit about sort of the -- there's a wide range of indications for which I think, at this point, TL1A is implicated, I think uniquely, again, both the anti-inflammatory as well as anti-fibrotic types of indications. And I think just as we've done with some of our other programs, I think you should expect us to go and strike a balance of indications that are already at this point clinically validated as well as indications for which we will be first-in-class as well in novel indications. The only thing I'd add to that is just remember, we ultimately expect to have a franchise in anti-TL1A antibodies. We have an option on next-generation compounds that Pfizer has now disclosed as a bispecific antibody to TL1A and P40, which we think will have super interesting biology and potential applicability in different indications and in different settings. And so we're watching that closely. A little bit of ways out, we're going to get Phase I data in 2025 there. But excited for the full breadth of what we should be able to do with that franchise. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. I just had a couple. Let me just first ask about the [ Thomas ] scripts. So the new to brand, if I'm looking at it correctly, it seemed to be stabilizing. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what kind of trends you're seeing with patients? Are they seeing [indiscernible]? Is this sort of a factor of coverage? Or is it more about just like trends with patients? And what do you expect to see going forward?
And then just a sort of a question around 1402 and Immunovant. So you've got a lot of -- you have got a big data set coming up with 1402 and then potential RA data from nipocalimab committing. And so there's a lot of questions we're getting around how much this opportunity could really expand. And you'd have to maybe do a lot more trials once we see data in rheumatoid and with 1402. How does it work between you and Immunovant and deciding how broad you actually can expand the market for 1402, I understand? And how does it work because we get a lot of questions on M&A on whether or not like if someone approaches you for Immunovant for that company, like how does it work as far as you're factoring into whether or not that company could be acquired? Yes. Thanks, Robyn. It's a couple of great questions. I appreciate it, and good to hear from you. The first thing I'll say is, I don't think we believe that scripts are stabilizing. I think -- we think there's a little bit of chop in the last month or so, which was a combination of the holidays. And then we had winter sales force meetings, so we had 1/3 of our sales force out of the field for each of sort of 3 consecutive weeks. And when we look at trends at the doc level, we are optimistic that we continue to grow in all of the important directions there. So I think you will continue to see scripts growing from here.
I think the AV data for what it's worth has the potential to supercharge that just in terms of drawing doc attention to what this drug is capable of broadly. But I think, even without that, you should expect to see a real sort of growth focus in those group numbers. And obviously, the payer contracting progress, which -- much of which is pretty recent is helpful there, but also just sort of continued enthusiasm, we think we'll build script volumes from here. So again, I appreciate that it looks a little choppy in the last month or so. But I think you'll see that looking better and better over time.
On 1402, yes, look, I think we agree that there's a lot of opportunity here. Our relationship with Immunovant is really tight. Frank's exact Chair. We work incredibly closely with them on indication strategy. Obviously, their team is experienced and thoughtful and has a lot of great ideas. And we try and bring the best deployment to the table as well so that we're bringing all the best ideas up for consideration. A lot of ideas for where that could go, obviously, both internally and externally. And so we learn a lot from the field. As far as M&A is concerned, look, it's fantastic to be in a category with so much therapeutic relevance and to see that opportunities are growing frequently as our competitors, and we show new data. I think it's fair to say we are an economic actor as far as how we think about Immunovant, and understand the great appeal that FcRn will have as a target for many big pharma companies. So I think it's fair to say, while we would be involved in any discussions, that we will act thoughtfully and rationally as we as we hear anything. And just a follow-up there, and this is really a [ typical ] question, but like can you stop it, for example, to say if someone approaches and they have an offer for Immunovant that are interested? And I just ask because I get this question a ton of times, but how does the relationship between Roivant and Immunovant work if that situation were to unfold? Sorry to follow up like that. No, it's good. And I appreciate there's a lot of questions about the stuff. Look, the simple answer is that we are a majority shareholder, like any other majority shareholder. And so we have mechanical voting control. But as I said, we're an economically rational actor. And so I don't think the question of whether we could stop M&A and winds up being a particularly relevant question to the way that we expect any situation to develop. Great. And 1 last one. So you really have done a good job of talking about all your programs ongoing, a lot of catalyst driven. When we go back to the original format of Roivant of having an engine that produces drugs, like what are your thoughts on how we should view the cadence of new vants coming out of the company this year when you have so much data coming out and there's so many big opportunities with the current vant you have on the market. How do we think about the rest of the company as a whole? It's a great question. Look, the first thing I'll say is, we've been very mindful of the capital environment over the last, call it, 18 months. And obviously, that affects the bar for new programs and it affects the way that we think about opportunity. That said, look, I think there's approximately nobody out there who regress the fact that we brought in our anti-TL1A antibody that was something that was not on anybody's radar as a part of Roivant as recently as about 3.5 months ago. So this is the thing we often do best. And what I think is, the bar is high, but if we see more opportunities of the same quality as TL1A, you've got to imagine we're going to take them. And the same thing is true for external opportunities and for things that develop internally, whether it's clinical data or something sort of bring to a new phase of life. If the data are compelling, we will figure out a way to progress it. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Maybe just with additional time since the VTAMA launch. What -- can you share with respect to what you're seeing from patient behavior in terms of things like refills? And what's the rate at what you're seeing in refills if you're seeing much of that? Yes. Thanks, Corinne. It's a great question. Look, I think, the first thing is the most important thing that's come out of the time since launch is for a lot of patients and doc enthusiasm for the product. We have a decent number of refills, you can see it in the -- approximations in the IMS script data around NRx versus TRx. I think we will continue to see patients -- many patients using multiple tubes a year. I think exactly how many tubes a year on parsing out that behavior. To be honest, I would say -- start saying, I think it's still a little bit premature to fully know the answer to how many tubes a year.
But the ""good"" news is it remains true that steroids are generally kind of 1 to 2 tube a year products. And mostly the opportunity that we're casing is to replace steroid scripts with the VTAMA scripts. So I think there's upside from more scripts beyond that for a year or more tubes beyond that for a year, but that's plenty of opportunity for the near term. So prematurity to give sort of a quantification to tubes per year. But in general, we see a decent amount of refill activity, which we take as a sign of patient enthusiasm. Helpful. And then maybe on 3101, just as you think about additional indication selection through the year, can you help us understand which criteria you're using to assess which indications you're interested in pursuing? I'll hand it over to Mayukh for that question. Sorry, I missed the question. It's criteria to select new indications. Yes. I mean I think -- look -- I think we look at it, I think, very holistically, I think it's a mix of strength of biological basis for it, I think mechanistic evidence to support of it. And then I think to a certain extent, it's also designed and sort of structure of a clinical trial. In other words, is there a way in which we could kind of find an answer, see a signal without running a very large study as the next study? Yes. I think the other thing -- there is 2 other things. One is, obviously, we're focused on commercial opportunities, sort of the size and indication of the size of the opportunity. And frankly, given the quality of the clinical data we've seen in UC, just a huge amount of potential for the class. We want to make sure we're maximizing that opportunity. And then actually, I'll go back to another answer I gave, which this is one of the areas where, over the long term, having a franchise with multiple approaches to TL1A as we will between our sort of lead program and then the TL1A P40 bi-specific gives us an opportunity to think holistically about indication strategy over time. And obviously, right now, you can imagine we are doing the work on the biggest, fastest opportunities for where we can go with TL1A and have it impacted in IBD in size, and then we'll sort of branch out from there. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. I have 3 questions on TL1A, so #1, if you look at the industry maintenance data for UC, this looked a little bit noisy with some drugs showing remission going up, some showing it coming down. And for Roivant will be the first time maintenance data will be reported for anti-TL1A antibody. And obviously, you've looked at some of the initial data already, and you said that the data has held up. So are you confident that when we get the chronic data in the first half, that remission wouldn't come down from the induction period?
And then #2, I don't see anywhere on your slides about your Phase III plant in UC. And given TL1A is obviously a very competitive space, what additional things do you need to do before Phase III starts? And are you confident that Phase III would start this year?
And then lastly, can you remind us and perhaps reiterate your confidence around the subcu reformulation that you'll be taking into Phase III? Thanks, Dennis. Those are all great questions. So on the first one, I'm not a superstitious person, but I find it hard to express confidence in clinical realty, but again there's still real data to collect there. There's still patients that we don't have the data for and patients who are still being evaluated. So -- but I think -- I agree with you that there are drugs that are all over the map from degradation to improvement in efficacy. I'll say that we start from a very favorable bar. Our sort of induction data was really strong. And so I think flat would create still some of the best 52-week data the world had ever seen. So I think, from that perspective, in some ways, the question is a little bit less relevant to us than to some other classes where the induction data may be on the disappointing side but then maintenance data pulls it up into a more interesting territory. I think, for us, flat or even a little bit of degradation is probably commercially fine.
Obviously, there's certainly the possibility with the anti-fibrotic effect and so on to see better, but we'll see that when we see the data. So look, I think we feel good about where we are. We feel good about what we know based on the interim look, but we'll know for sure when we see the data, and we're checking to share it with everybody once we've got it.
On Crohn's, I'll say, first of all, I agree with you it's a competitive space. And I think one of the reasons that we're being a little bit careful with how we communicate about study start time lines, and that's frankly for both Crohn's and for UC, is that we're sort of focused on that competitive environment. We have, as you know, an incredibly robust Phase IIb data set with full dose ranging. Our Phase IIb study was run subcu. So you're asking about subcu into Phase III, was where we are the only TL1A antibody with actual patient data in the clinical trial from any subcu formulation. So I think we've got a lot of information in our hands that will aid with Phase III design that will allow us to run a tight, fast Phase III program. And so I think we're sort of holding a lot of that design question in reserve competitively as we think it's an advantage to when we get the product approved, and we'll share it kind of when we're ready.
Look, on the subcu opportunity, look, the first thing I'll say is I'll just remind everybody, we are the only anti-TL1A antibody that has been studied in patients subcu. So our data gives us tremendous confidence around our ability to treat patients subcu and to deliver the kind of efficacy that we've seen. We are ready to take a more concentrated formulation than our Phase IIb formulation into Phase III. We're not going to comment right now on the specifics, but we are highly confident about that formulation, and that work was effectively already completed even before we took the program in at Pfizer. So that's ready to go. And in short, we're not -- we don't think there's going to be any issues with subcu formulation. And yes, feel good about our sort of ability to carry the drug subcu into Phase III, given the data we've already got from subcu in our Phase II. There's no issues with our formulation whatsoever. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao with HCW. Congrats on the progress, Matt. So maybe just touching on your emerging I&I franchise. Just curious, Matt, because as a company, Roivant has had a history of monetizing assets. Obviously, to Robyn's question, there's questions around strategic value of [ Immunovant ] as well as other individual assets. So just curious how essential do you think each of these are individually towards building an I&I franchise or do you think given the strength of the assets that some individual ones can be -- could be potentially separated out and still have the franchise stand on its own? Look, it's a great question. I think the short answer is, we are fiercely economic actors in every way. And so on the one hand, we're very proud of the franchise that we've built and the opportunity for each of these things. And on the other hand, we got the track record that you've observed. The last thing I'll say is, there is a lot of interest in individual I&I programs and targets out there, obviously. But also as a whole, there are many businesses that may need to expand by multiple opportunities at the same time. And so the franchise, in aggregate, could also present some unique opportunities. And actually, at least one of our past monetizations that you referred to involved a franchise with multiple programs, and I'd say nothing is off the table. But I guess -- so Matt, do you -- at what point, just given the size of that category and when you look at many of the leading players, they have multiple assets. Do you think that you need to have multiple assets to be effective in I&I commercially? Or do you think that, that is not appropriate sort of interpretation? And that given the strength of each of your assets, they can stand on their own? As a practical matter, I think most of the things in our portfolio could mechanically stand on their own, just given the quality of the individual things that we've got, right? Certainly, one of our competitors in FcRn has shown that a single FcRn antibody can succeed on its own. I think our competitor in TL1A, it's such a unique target, talks about the fact that it could mechanically stand on its own. That's it.
There's purely also a synergistic opportunity in these things sort of coexisting and being next to each other. And certainly, if any of these things were to wind up in big pharma hands, there would be benefit to sort of being co-resident with other I&I programs. So look, I think these things can definitely stand alone, but I think there's also some value to having them together. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Matt Gline for closing remarks. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everybody, for listening this morning. We appreciate it. It's been an exciting quarter. We've had a lot of opportunity to talk about some updates, looking forward to sharing more in the very near future and look forward to getting back together when we file our 10-K later this year as well. So we'll talk multiple times before then, and we'll speak again on a call like this closer to the middle of the year. Thank you, everybody, and have a great day. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.","we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation . we will begin with Matt Gline, who will review key business updates and provide a financial update . this will be a relatively shorter update because, frankly, we've had a busy quarter .",1.0

Welcome to the Roivant Sciences Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen on the mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stephanie Lee with Roivant. Your line is open. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to review Roivant's financial results from the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. I'm Stephanie Lee with Roivant Sciences. Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, CEO of Rogan. For those dialing in via conference call, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release and now can be updated on our IR website at www.investor.agan.com. We'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along. I'd like to remind you that we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt. Thank you, Steph, and thank you, everybody, for listening this morning. It's great to be back. It's -- I was talking to the team this morning saying it feels like a slightly anti-connected call because we were obviously just together last week to talk about the really exciting data from the chronic period of our RVT3101 study. But actually, an enormous amount has happened for us, both in this fiscal year generally as well as specifically in recent quarters. So looking forward to providing updates on those topics. We'll talk a little bit about where we are through the course of our year. We'll give some great updates on the progress that we're making with the ongoing launch of VTAMA as well as a reminder of our atopic dermatitis results. We'll do a quick refresh of the data we put out last week on RG311, A quick update on our FcRn program, a financial update, and then we'll turn the line over to Q&A.
Starting on Slide 5. Just kind of as a reminder or a level setting, look, we're really proud of the continued progress that we've made here. We celebrated this quarter with a dooring, the 10th consecutive positive Phase III study that we have run. That's the most recent 10 studies that we've run have been successful. We now have 6 products that we've gotten approved by FDA out of our model. We reported $1.7 billion in cash as of March 31, which supports our cash runway to the second half of 2025 before which we'll have a tremendous amount of data to share. And then we are incredibly proud of what we now believe is an industry-leading pipeline, especially in late-stage I&I with over $15 billion of sales potential supported by the ongoing launch of VTAMA and with a number of potential best or first-in-class programs.
We've said all along on Slide 6 that 2023 was going to be our biggest year, we are right at the midway point, both in terms of the year and in terms of the data that we've been look forward to sharing. We've continued to provide updates on VTAMA as we will do today, and this has been another great quarter of progress for that launch. We've now shared data for both of our Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis for VTAMA, data that we think is really, really exciting and will support an important product in that class pending potential DA approval next year. We've now supported data from both the induction and chronic periods of our study of RVT3101, our HTTL1A antibody in ulcerative colitis, which again is phenomenal data. We think so really top-end efficacy that has the potential to really matter for patients and to be an important new option we'll continue to ride updates on that program.
Still coming and obviously closely watched our number of updates from our anti-FcRn franchise, including the healthy volunteer study for IMVT-1402, which we hope and believe will establish that program as a best-in-class anti-FcRn antibody as well as a number of ongoing trials in bitoklimab to show continued efficacy of that agent and the class in multiple indications. And then finally, in the fourth quarter of this year, and we will talk more about this before it comes, we have our readout of brepocitinib or TYK2/JAK1, it's a potentially pivotal 102 studies in SLE, which we think has the potential to be, again, transformational top-level efficacy in that patient population.
And on Slide 7, just as a reminder, we are just very proud of our portfolio of our pipeline overall here with a number of late-stage agents that we think matter in some of the biggest classes, certainly in immunology. And we will continue to add to this pipeline as opportunities present themselves. Obviously, we made some really important additions within the last 12 months with IPT4102 and RVT3101. And I hope we can find more just like those 2 to bring on in the coming year. So I will start in the next section here with an update on the commercial launch of VTAMA.
On Slide 9, I'll say we are very excited about the way that demand continues to evolve for VTAMA. We are the best launching novel topical. We believe in psoriasis history. We are obviously the best selling branded topical in psoriasis and have been since very shortly after our launch. We continue to like the way that the demand has grown, and we expect to see it continue to build through the end of this year as various things including coverage and our DTC efforts build. On Slide 10, some really great progress here in the early launch that we just wanted to make sure we hit. First of all, we did $13.7 million in net product revenue for the March 31 quarter, which is up a pretty good degree from $9 million or $9.2 million in the prior quarter.
So obviously happy with the sales number. Maybe frankly, even happier with the progress that we made during the quarter in gross net yield, up from 18% to 25%, which is a reflection of the breadth of coverage that we added, frankly, faster than expected in the first quarter of this year, and we've continued to add coverage since. So we're really happy with that. In some ways, I think we managed to pull forward gross to net improvements earlier this year, and we continue to feel good about our trajectory through the year. We'll talk more about that over time.
From a coverage perspective, on Slide 11, we're now up to 76% of commercial lives covered within a year of launch. This is better by a meaningful margin than our expectation at the time we launched the product. This includes the addition of 2 major -- 2 national PBM formularies, 2 national health plan formularies during this period. An important regional PV and formulary well with 18 ABS plans. So just really great coverage. And as a reminder, the significant majority of that coverage is single step through steroids, which is exactly where we wanted to be when we launched the product and which gives us access to the patient population that matters most to us. As a reminder, there are almost 400,000 topical corticosteroid scripts every week between psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. And we're currently doing about 4,000 or a little bit more than 4,000 scripts a week. So we have a ton of room to grow into that opportunity, and we're really excited to do that both in psoriasis today and pending FDA approval in a dermatitis as well.
Speaking of atopic dermatitis, on Slide 12 here, just a little reminder we've talked a lot about this data. We got together to talk about the Dorint data on the call in March, we put out the DR1 data as well, which is extremely consistent. This is just -- it's great data. We are really excited about this. It's data that is really -- it's terrific on IGA response rates, really, really good E75. And I'm very happy with the quality of the idea here. The reported data was in adults that looked very good in children as well and about equivalent. And we feel like NAD, which is really a disease market by itch, these data are going to make a really big difference for patients.
And as a reminder, this study went all the way down to pediatric patients in H2, which is right because the pediatric patient botulin maybe is large and the unmet need there is significant. Across all patients and especially in pediatric patients on Slide 13. One thing that you really care about with a topical agent is safety. And I think it's clear from our data that the tolerability of this agent in atopic dermatitis is very, very good, frankly, even a little bit better than we saw in psoriasis with very low rates of contact dermatitis, very low rates of follicular events. Just a clean profile that gives us exactly the profile of a product we think will matter to physicians and patients. So really excited about the data from a safety perspective as well.
I won't spend too much time on the crush hot comparison on Slide 14, but this is data in a moderate to severe patient population that looks competitive with or better even a number of systemic agents and certainly in the same ballpark or better than anything else that is topical in atopic dermatitis. So more updates to share on Dermavant over the course of the year. Looking forward to continue cover, looking forward to progress in the franchise. Looking forward to providing updates on the SNDA filing for Vitamin D, which we expect to be at the very beginning of next calendar year. Looking forward to sharing those in quarters to come.
So I'm going to pivot now and give a brief reminder. This is data that we put out just last week. So I won't spend a lot of time on it with RVT3101. On Slide 16, we really believe this program is in a class of its own, right? Anti-T antibodies at this point between our program and one of our competitors that also reported data earlier this year. This is a remarkable class of drugs that has shown incredible efficacy, and we are very proud to be the first agent to show sort of real and proper-blinded 52-week data last week. And it's great data. We showed substantial improvements between week 4 and with 56 across basically all of the endpoints in our go-forward dose. We are the only anti-TL1A antibody at this point with valid long-term efficacy data, and we have over 200 patients of set data. we have a biomarker that we've talked a bit about that is relevant to 60% of the UC population with meaningful improvement in efficacy relative to the all-comers population.
And then safety has been very good for the agent in the study so far. And we've seen no impact of immunogenicity on the program, which we know was a question that people are hoping to get run to ground in this trial. So we're now full speed ahead here with a plan to run a simple Phase III program with a single subcutaneous dose in the near future, and we'll provide updates on that just after our discussion with FDA, which is coming this summer.
As a reminder of the data, and I'll go quickly on this on Slide 17. We saw modified Maoclinical remission. This was in our KNR Phase III dose, go from 29% to 14 weeks to 36% at 56 weeks, a remarkable 50% of week 56 in endostatic improvement. And then endostatic remission, this is an [indiscernible] of 0. It's something that, frankly, very few agents hit, and so we don't typically see it reported. And we were really excited with what we saw there with 21% of patients in the all-comers population on the Phase III dose, achieving a clear endoscopy.
Once you overlay the biomarker on Slide 18, that data looks even better it gets up to 43% clinical remission in the Phase III dose at week 56, 64% of patients meeting the are endostatic improvements. And again, a really exciting 36% of patients in endostatic remission by week 56, which no look, we didn't measure specific antifibrotic markers here. But personally, I look at this data suggesting that we are having a potential disease-modifying impact on these patients. So really exciting.
Another topic -- and this is also data that we shared, but just as a reminder, in a large patient population here of really the whole study in patients who are biologic experience, with our biomarker, we saw, frankly, just phenomenal data at 56 weeks, 34% clinical remission for biologic experience patients, 45% endostatic improvement. This is some of the best data that's been shown in bilas-experienced patients, which are generally recalcitrant and hard to treat. And as a reminder, this includes patients on doses other than our optimally chosen dose. So we expect when we generate large end data in our Phase III studies that there's room for improvement even over these really great numbers. So very excited about the potential for efficacy in the biologic experience population. And I think any way that we look at our data where there's sufficient and to reach a judgment, we feel very confident that this is going to be a great agent in later lines of therapy.
Obviously, all that has to be backed up by a good safety profile. And one of the really exciting things about the TL1A class, and you can see our safety data on Slide 20 is because of the way TL1A works a mechanism because it is really only sort of present in disease inflict tissue in terms of signal amplifier you don't get some of the infection and other things that you see in other anti-inflammatory classes. And so we had no severe infections observed and no infections observed greater equal to 5% rate in the chronic period.
And just generally, we saw a really good safety profile 356, well tolerated at all doses and serious AEs were practice determined by the sponsor not to be related to drugs. So very clean safety profile that we think is going to help the utility of the drug going forward. And then finally, on the data on Slide 21 as a reminder, one of the questions that we got a lot going into the maintenance period was whether I mean is was going to matter. We were reasonably confident that it was not.
What you can see on this slide in the chart in the middle, this is across the data pool across all 9 arms of the study. Patients with ADAs by and large, had somewhat better clinical remission than patients without ADAs, and it was uncorrelated with the quartile of ADA titer. We don't think this is a real effect, obviously. We just think this is noise. We think the ADAs are having no impact on safety or efficacy across all the arms of the study. And we have said we expect that our rising antibody rate to be flat to down. I perhaps say it was 0 at week 56, and the expected Phase III dose. So we have no patients mutualizing antibodies that 56 on that are.
On Slide 22, without belaboring the point too much, we feel really great about the amount of data that we have here, and it is quite differentiated relative to the field here. We have over 400 subjects dosed, including 250 patients dosed across an IV and 3 subcutaneous doses, 200 patients dosed across 3 seasons out to a year of dosing, just hundreds of basis dose no matter how you cut it. We are the only agent here with subcutaneous data, the only agent here with anything like this quantum of long-term data. Our biomarker, which prospectively specified has obviously been tested in many patients, and we expect a commercial form factor that is a once-monthly subcutaneous auto-injector. So we really feel great about our profile versus the other agents in this class, which also have where we expect will show promising data given the quality of the target.
Finally, on Slide 22, I wanted to highlight, we have initiated, as we mentioned last week, a Phase II study in Crohn's disease. It's just over 100 patients. It is 2 doses subcutaneous monthly similar in that sense to the Phase IIb study that we just ran in UC. There will be 12 weeks of dosing followed by a 40-week chronic period, again, similar with a similar set of endpoints, which you can see on Slide 22. This was a study that we wanted to start very quickly because we realized, as we took a step back that we felt like we could run a proper dose ranging study in Crohn's patients without giving up any ground on the opportunity to be first-in-class in Crohn's, and that would allow us to run just as we are doing and you see a straightforward, simple single-dose Phase III study that will be optimal for patients. One question I expect we'll get is in placebo arm in the study. The basic answer to that is we want to get the dose ranging study done as quickly as we possibly could. And so we wanted to make this a really attractive study for patients to enroll in starting now. And so we're trying to have that study up and running.
So overall, as a reminder on Slide 14 -- or sorry, Slide 24, just really excited about this program. I think it is a major anchor in our late-stage pipeline. We think it will be the first-in-class anti-TL1A antibody with an efficient well validated path we will on a single dose carried forward to Phase III. We think we are uniquely positioned to overcome some of the limitations of IVD therapies, including efficacy in later-line therapy with sustained clinical remission and endoscopic improvements among the highest ever reported.
We think our biomarker further differentiates this class and our agent versus other treatment options for IBD patients and gives us an opportunity to select for patients with an even higher clinical remission rate, although notably, we think our data clearly supports a study in an all-comers population, irrespective of biomarker status or a line of therapy. And our expectation is that, that is the patient population that we will be targeting for approval. And then finally, just many opportunities for additional growth, including the Crohn study I just mentioned as well as the dual targeting of both inflammatory fibrotic pathways, opening up a range of large markets and high end that need indications that go well beyond Diab D, and we'll look forward to sharing more on that as soon as we're underway with additional studies.
Finally, I want to spend a few minutes on IMG-1402 and our anti-FcRn franchise. Obviously, Immunovant has spoken about this program. And there's no new updates in the section, but just wanted to remind everybody of what was coming, given how excited we are about this program. So on Slide 26, as a reminder, we have a proper franchise in antisera antibodies with our first-generation batoclimab currently in multiple pivotal studies across MDD and CIDP with data coming over the next couple of years in those studies as well as others.
And then we have our next interaction antibody, INT-1402, which we believe will have the same best-in-class suppression of IgG as batoclimab, while showing minimal impact on albumin in LDL and therefore, being useful for chronic dosing and diseases with an even larger population. We have data coming from that program in August, September for single sending dose data in October November for multiple sending dose data. And we think that has the potential to establish that agent is best in class.
As a reminder, both of these agents are proper classic subcus. They are subcutaneously administered. They are simple subcu-injections. They will be sort of at home administered, we believe, and sort of very straightforward comparable with other subcu-programs on the market, which we think is also at this point, something differentiated and something we do not believe any of the other agents in the class have today.
Our Phase I study that's ongoing IMVT-1402 has, as I said, single ascending and multiple ascending dose cohorts. That study is underway, and we are looking forward to sharing that data later this year, as I mentioned. And we believe that the data that we have in hand is likely -- we have NHP data that we've shared on these calls and other forums. And based on our data for batoclimab, both on albumin and on IGG, we think the SAD data, which we will be putting out a at the end of the summer may be usefully predictive of MAD data. I get a fair number of questions on the war for success.
And I guess the one thing I'd like to say is, look, we believe based on the NHP data and based on the way these programs are engineered that we should be clean and albumin in LDL. Remember that the LDL assay has about a 10% variability and the albumin assay is a little bit more specific than that, but has some variability. And frankly, although we have seen to be clear, none of this data today. So I have no information about what this will show and our expectation from the NHP days but ought to be clean. Our advisers tell us that even up to, for example, a 10% of surge in LDL would not be clinically meaningful. So looking forward to sharing that data, optimistic given the way that drug was engineered as well as the NHP data that we should have a good result there and look forward to getting that together with the Immunovant team later this year to go through it.
Finally, I'll give a brief financial update on Slide 21, and then we'll open the line for Q&A. So we showed net revenue of $27 million, including net product revenue of $14 million for the quarter ending March 31. And or net revenue of about $60 million and net product revenue of about $28 million for the fiscal year. For the quarter, we had R&D expense of $130 million or adjusted R&D expense about $126 million. And SG&A was $126 million or adjusted about $100 million. So consistent with prior quarters from a spend and burn perspective.
And notably, we ended the fiscal year with $1.7 billion in cash equivalents, which we feel good about as far as carrying us into that second half of 2025 guidance giving us lots of opportunity to turn over data cards. So look, I won't go through all of the catalysts on Slide 33. I'll just say we've talked about some of them here, but there is a long list to come of important developments, including in programs we've talked very little about frankly. And so we're looking forward to sharing that data look forward to getting back together. It's been a tremendous fiscal year for us. It's hard to believe this is only the second 10-K we filed. I want to thank all of our patients and the team at Roivant as well as those listening on this call for being with us. And with that, I will pause and turn the line over to Q&A. Thank you, everybody. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Just going back, Matt, on your comments around like the bar for 1402, do you think, given the properties of the molecule that we should look at the graphs that you've shown for the SAD and IgG data and it will look similar? Like is -- are the properties of the molecule similar enough that we should expect the curves to look similar? That's my first question, then I have a follow-up. So I'll also invite Frank, if he has any comments there. Obviously, Immunovant team talks about this often. I see like overall, in terms of the broad properties, I think the answer is we would expect them to look generally similar. Obviously, with the notable difference that 1402 has been engineered to avoid the almond binding, and so the albumin interferon steric hindrance. And so I would not expect to see an impact on Aluminide. Frank, anything you'd add to that? I think that's well said. The only thing I'd add is, they are not identical antibodies, obviously. So they have slightly different properties and they are similar. I would encourage the investment community to kind of look at the albumin data as probably the most robust and reproducible assay among the assays we're going to be presenting in the future, but I do think that the curve should be directly similar. And for IgG as well. That's what I was really asking. And then a question on VTAMA. So congratulations on doing a great job selling so much drug this quarter. I was just curious, can you give us some trends on what you're seeing in feedback from the remittance effect. At what point might you expect to see patients not taking the drug or pausing the drug and not -- and then waiting for the disease to come back a little bit. I know it's early in the launch. So I just wanted to see if you're seeing anything there in that thing. Thanks, Robyn. It's a great question. I'll say broadly, first of all, physician and patient feedback on the remitted benefit is great. I think it's something that patients experience very quickly on drug, right? People go on. They use it for a while, they go off, they see the effect preserve, and we get a lot of feedback from docs and from patients that they are excited about it. I suspect that, that is embedded in the renewal rate for the product already. That is like the rate at which patients are renewing, the number of tubes that they're using is a function of that already. It's obviously a little bit too early to tell how that shakes out versus the overall growth in demand. But in general, it's not like I would expect to see some sort of significant change in the future because of that effect.
And I think it's a selling point for the drug. I think it's something that physicians are happy to tell the patients that they can go off drug and continue to see a benefit. In terms of tubes, I guess like I'm not sure that exactly your question, but our view has always been that in order to be successful, we need to be a steroid replacement. And the steroid sort of just over a 2 year, maybe a 2.25 a year. It already looks from our data like we are in excess of that. It's hard to tell how much in excess of that, given how early it is, but my expectation is that we will have more to per euro than steroids, mostly given the lack of duration limit on the drug. We have a question from David Risinger from SVB Securities. So congrats to you, Matt and your team for all the nice updates and the corporate progress. So with respect to my questions, I guess I'll start with VTAMA. So the trends are obviously moving in the right direction. But on Slide 9, it does show that the TRx peaked and I know that there are sometimes anomalies in the data, but the TRx peaked for a few weeks, close to 5,000 and they're not back at that level yet. So could you just talk about the trajectory ahead and the commercial drivers for the continued ramp of the product. And then second, with respect to the approval clock for AD, once you file it in the first quarter of '24, how many months after filing would you expect approval? And then finally, a higher-level question, could you talk about second half '23 transaction opportunities. So should we expect a potential acquisition of additional external assets? Is it possible for Roivant to monetize an undervalued asset, any framework for thinking about potential external transaction activities would be helpful. Thanks for listening, David. Thanks for those are all great questions. I will take them in order. First of all, on the script trends, thanks for asking the question. Look, I think, first of all, there's clearly just like week-on-week variability in the strips, and that's been true for all of the topical launches. It's not just ours. And so I think a little bit of the sort of ""choppiness"" noise, and I expect we will continue to break through the ceilings that we set for a set for ourselves over time. It may not be linear. The particular peak that you pointed out was just on the back of AD.
And I think there were some docs who were maybe trying the product out on the back of that first atopic dermatitis data. And I guess my hope and expectation is that that's a preview of what's to come when the AD approval comes in, in terms of the level of enthusiasm around that data. But obviously, the product is currently not approved in that indication. In terms of time lines, so it's an sNDA, we expect a 10-month approval clock is the short answer after filing. And then in terms of transactions in the second half of the year, look, I think it is clear from our history that we are not great at sitting still. It's a pretty exciting market in a lot of different directions.
Obviously, some of the targets that we are in are targets that are closely watched. They're targets that big pharma companies clearly care about. So you can imagine those are discussions that we're thinking through economically and trying to make sure we do the right thing for patients and the right thing for each program in turn. And then in the other direction, it remains a very fertile opportunity for new programs. Big pharma companies are constantly making portfolio prioritization decisions. obviously, the patent flip dynamics and other things facing the industry that have provided us opportunity in the past still can. And I think you can expect that we are looking actively at lots of things. And I hope to be able to share some of them with you over the course of the rest of the year. Our next question comes from Neena Bitritto-Garg with Citi. Sorry, if you can hear me. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question to Robyn's question earlier about what you're looking to see with 1402. Just in terms of the albumin reduction since it sounds like that is the most reliable sort of assay to look at. How should we think about what an acceptable albumin reduction looks like. I believe with the lower dose of batoclimab or the, I think, the 340 mg dose, you saw about a 30% reduction, which corresponded to about a 40% increase in LDL. So I guess, is there a benchmark on albumin reduction that we should be thinking about in terms of translatability to that kind of 10% or less LDL increase? Yes. Thanks, Neena. And I'll ask Frank if you had any comments as well. Look, I think the short answer is lower is clearly better. And our expectation is it will be categorically different than what we saw with batoclimab and much lower. I think the sensitivity of these assays is in the kind of mid-single-digit range. And so I would say anything within that range should be completely acceptable as noise and will, in our view, lead to very low LDL in any reasonable patient acylation. So that's probably how I answer that question. Frank, anything to add to that? No, I think that's… Perfect. We have a question from Corinne Jenkins with Goldman Sachs. Maybe a couple of questions from us. First, what can you share with respect to like fill rate and the time from prescription to fill for VTAMA? And it sounds like it's early, but whatever other color you could provide on refill rate at this point would be helpful. Maybe I'll start there and ask my second one as a follow-up. Thanks, Corinne. Appreciate the question. And I'll -- again, I'll ask Frank had anything to add here. I think our general view is patients getting scripts filled has not been a significant challenge at this stage. Early in our launch of specialty, we were heavily seeing fills through specialty retail derm pharmacies, which are a direct channel that the dermatologists work with all the time that we're very knowledgeable about VTAMA, knowledgeable about our copay card program and so on. So I think that was helpful at this point with our insurance coverage, frankly, many patients who show up at the pharmacy or just cover that the pharmacy.
And so again, I feel it was as easy as any other product of Walgreens or CVS and so on. So I think we're not seeing much in terms of challenges getting scripts filled. On refill rate, look, I think we've been happy to see growth in NRx as well as good growth in TRx. And I think we're seeing a good number of refills. That's, in our view, a measure of the fact that patients on drug are happy to be on drug and continue to use it. And again, we don't have that duration limit. So I don't know how much to add beyond the data that say, I think it's clear from our current refill rate, as I said before, that we will be in excess of steroids in terms of tunes per year. Frank, anything you'd say on either of those points? I think the only thing to add is, as you know, our coverage has been increasing meaningfully over time, and that is -- there's a little bit of a lagging effect, obviously, and how that coverage comes into play and plans its way into downstream plans. And so I think you'll see our -- the ease of prescriptions at the point of sale only continue to get better as that coverage has come and continues to come into place. Okay. Helpful. And then as you think about, I think you referenced direct-to-consumer campaigns and spend, just how do you think about balancing that spend versus the coverage and yield rates you're working with today? And how can that change over the course of the year? Yes, thanks. Look, it's a great question. And obviously, I think we've talked about this in various forms for early in the launch, when we didn't have the kind of payer coverage that we do now, DTC is a real balancing act because you can definitely drive volume through DTC. But if you're not getting coverage, you're driving volume that is not sort of commercially helpful volume per se, and it does cut against GTM. But where we are now with 76% commercial coverage, I'd say in general, demand generation is going to be helpful. And so we've increased sort of the picture around DTC. The Derm team has put together a great campaign.
It's out there now, and we're sort of still in the early days of it figuring out exactly the right targeting plans and sort of getting real-time feedback from the marketplace. -- but feel good about what that's going to mean. I would expect to see that take some time to filter into the strip trajectory. It takes a number of impressions before patients respond to you can see and come into the office and so on. So that's something to watch for kind of through the end of this year and beyond. But in general, I think it will matter. And then in terms of spend, I'll just say it's included in the various guidance that we've given in terms of where we expect it to be. And I'd say in the grand scheme of things, it will be well worth it for the demand that we generate on the back of it. We have a question from Dennis Ding with Jefferies. Just 2 for me on TL1A. For your Crohn's program, thanks for timing your deck. Can you comment on if you will use similar doses as you did in UC? Or could you explore higher doses? And maybe talk a little bit more about the biomarkers is this the same biomarker from UC. And then number 2, I saw in your 10-K that for TL1A, 20% of patients who are biomarker positive did not give consent. Can you confirm that's true? And maybe give a little bit more color as to why and perhaps the commercial interpatient there. Perfect. Thanks. So on the dose question, I'd say we're pulling from a similar range of doses in the Crohn's study as in UC. So I think that's the answer on dose. And on biomarker, we are using the same biomarker algorithm in Crohn's as we used in UC. And our expectation is that the patient population should be similar in the size of the patient population. And our belief based on our understanding of our biomarker algorithm is that it should obtain equally chrome, obviously, we're excited to see that data from the study. On your question about the 20% consent.
So this is something we had shared at the time of the induction data. Basically, the biomarker samples were gathered from all patients in the study but the analysis of those samples required a separate consent and the sponsor of the study did not obtain consent for 20% of the patients in the study for those samples to be analyzed because of local IRB and site policies. So basically, all of our biomarker data, biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative effectively reflects on 80% of the study population. Where all comers include even those 20% of patients for which the biomarker data was not gathered. We have no reason to believe there's any relationship between those consents and severity or anything else. The data are robust. There's plenty of end, but that's just the way the study was conducted. Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up around the LNP patent litigation. What's going on there? And when can we get the next update? Are we still waiting for that claims construction order maybe in 2024? Yes. Thanks. So those cases, and there are several of them at this point are ongoing, and we continue to be pleased with the overall progress now that we're actually in the medium the case. We are in the discovery process in the Moderna case now. And so you can imagine new information will be forthcoming that will affect the progression of the case. But most importantly, we're gearing up for that same think construction hearing and claim construction order that will come at the beginning of next year. That will probably be the biggest, most publicly visible next step, although plenty will be happening behind the scenes over the course of the fall. We have a question from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. This is Julius on for Yaron. Maybe just a follow-up on the question before about 101 in Crohn's. Is there a hypothesis here that it might work better in Crohn's just given that the fibrotic component is a bit more involved in this disease versus UC. And then you obviously show really great data on endoscopic remission in the FDIC study. Can you just maybe comment on what you're hoping to see there in Crohn's disease? And maybe what other studies have shown in the past on this endpoint? Yes. Perfect. Thank you. These are great questions. Look, obviously, the study will show what it will show. Certainly, the line of pression you're asking is one that we thought to that Crohn's is an even more -- fibrosis is even more involved in Crohn's ease than it is in UC. And when we look at things like the specific markers of fibrosis that were identified in Pfizer's Phase II(a) study as well as the anomic remission and the clean endoscopy that we saw in our own Phase II(b) in the chronic period. I think there's certainly reason to believe that we could potentially be even more differentially efficacious MCD. And look, agents typically that work in one typically work for the other.
So I think that's the other the other sort of generally historically true fact. And certainly, a biology of TL1A suggests the same would be true here. And then look, our biomarker, as I just said, also we think should carry through into CD. It should give us an opportunity for differential efficacy in a large subset of CD patients as well. In terms of endoscopic remission specifically, it's a good question. I don't have a super specific answer. I think Crohn's patients may have more tissue involvement than UC patients. So that may be a slightly tougher endpoint in that patient population. But on the other hand, we're delivering an antifibrotic benefit that could matter. And I would say it certainly seems plausible that we would see benefit in endoscopic remission as well. And our next question comes from Brian Cheng with JPMorgan. Maybe just first one on TL1A related to your Phase II trial design that you have ongoing for Crohn's. I'm just curious if you can provide a bit more color on the dosing that you have selected, specifically in the chronic period. It seems that you will be only be evaluating one specific maintenance dose based on Slide 23. Just curious if you already have a sense of what the dose will be for the chronic portion? If not, what would be the deciding factors for the chronic portion? And I have a follow-up. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Look, I appreciate the question. We believe we got a fair amount of information from the dose ranging in our UC study that has been helpful in making a prediction here, a pretty robust understanding from our dose response there. That's given us a good deal of confidence in Crohn's dosing. And we are pretty confident that we know what our chronic period dose will be in the Crohn's study. So there's no -- there's not really any ambiguity for us in that. We are -- for the same reason that we have not shared specific dosing information in UC. We're not going to share our choice of doses at this stage for the CD study, we will be happy to share those around the same time we're willing to share dose ranging data in use next year. But in general, dose response that has been identified USC is generally predictive across IPD. And so we feel pretty confident in our selection of doses there. As a reminder, we have very robust dose-ranging data at this point for 3. Okay. I guess related to hemavant, which I don't think a lot of investors have looked at yet. Just curious, one is, how should we think about the timing for this update given that you will have immunovant data spread through the fall and also you have brepocitinib data in the fourth quarter. So one is how should we think about the timing from the Phase I/II? And then also, what do we think about -- what should we think about the expectation for the lower risk MDS data? How do you think about the bar there for you to move forward to the next stage? Yes. Perfect. Thanks, Brian. That is -- it's a great question. You're absolutely right. We don't get it very often. So the study for 2001 is an open-label study, and we've had good progress on enrollment. So we're going to have a decent number of patients worth of data. We will provide the update probably pretty late this year, frankly, because the longer we wait, the more data we have, and I think we want to provide an update on the load comprehensive set of that data. I think in terms of the bar, as I think we've said before, in the earlier patients -- in the earlier study in AI -- or the early report of the study at AI conducted, there were about 20 patients or a little bit less than 20 patients that had the sort of profile that we are looking for here that were sort of low-risk transfusion-dependent MDS patients. And we saw sort of a little bit higher than 30% transfusion independence rate.
But I think what we're looking for here as we move into earlier line patients is something that would be sort of obviously competitive with or superior to luspatercept, which as I'm sure you know, is in kind of the mid-40s in patients without privalienomide exposure. So I think that's probably the first thing. The second thing we're looking for is we are hoping that a decent number of these patients will have this biomarker Abertamon14C transcripts, where we saw a very high response rate in the earlier patients. And if that's true, we should be able to provide some update on how we are doing in that patient population and whether that opens up for precision icono strategy. So that's broadly what we're looking for here. We will share that update, as I said, very late this year, almost certainly after the other. We have a question from Louise Chen from Cantor. Congratulations on the quarter. So I wanted to ask you, if you're approved for atopic dermatitis, is all the work or the payer work that you went -- or that went into beta for psoriasis, can that be leveraged? And then secondly, are rheumatoid arthritis, is that a potential opportunity for Immunovant? And if so, what do you think your go-forward plan would be there? And then lastly, just wanted to ask you for brepocitinib, big data readout coming at the end of the year. What do you think you need to see to move forward with this opportunity? And why do you think you'll be successful when others have failed here? Yes. Thanks, Louise. Those are all good questions that span the portfolio. So I'll take them in turn, but thanks for asking and thanks for listening, as always. So on the first one, the short answer to that question is it's definitely yes. That is all of the payer contracting work in psoriasis is extremely helpful in atopic dermatitis. Obviously, at some level, there is an additional sort of formulary positioning question that needs to be answered because the cascade of therapies at AD is slightly different. But the contracting work, all of the commercial work in psoriasis will translate and be very helpful in getting quickly on to formulary NAD. In terms of 1402, look, the sky is the limit from an indication perspective. And I think, especially now that we think we have really the only true at-home Easy subcu, any indication is eligible. RA, it's an interesting question biologically.
It's probably not something that we were initially very focused on. JJ has this ongoing study that they've talked a bit about, and they've said they are going to show that data later this year. You can imagine in autoantibody RA patients that there could be an opportunity. And I'd say if the JJ RA data looks good, we could be very quickly in, frankly, a pivotal study if we needed to and compete with them, probably, again, sort of the more severe patient population. And I think that could be a really, really exciting opportunity for 1402. And given 1402 profile, a simple subcu, what we believe will be the cleanliness in Albian LDL and the depth of ITT suppression. We think that's an example of an indication where if JJ's data is good, we think we ought clearly to be the best-in-class agent and frankly, it could be neck and neck for first-in-class at that time as well.
So really exciting possibility. On brepocitinib and SLE, we talked a little bit about this. It's not a simple numerical bar. Look, I think it's about building on the data that we've already seen, including data on baricitinib as a JAK1, more recent data in baricitinib is a DAC1 and then the data that we've seen in deucravacitinib as ATCI, combined with the knowledge that brepocitinib, which has now been in well over 1,000 patients, has outperformed the cross-trial comparisons, both JAK1 and TYK2s across many, many, many studies. Remember, it's been running 5 large late-stage sort of Phase II studies at this point. And so look, I think that combination gives us optimism that the agent could perform very well in SLE. The other factor with SLE always is you mentioned some of the challenges. So there's a base these studies are difficult to conduct. Pfizer has the conduct of the study, although we've had a lot of input. And I think we're doing everything we can to ensure including the study learned from many of the prior designs to optimize for the possibility for success there. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao with H.C Wainwright. Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now? Yes. Congrats on the progress. Just given what we saw from Tuscany, obviously, with 3101, you're starting the study in Crohn's. I'm just curious how much more broad how are you thinking about the opportunity with that asset outside of IBD. So obviously, Crohn's is a natural sort of first step, but are you thinking about other indications in I&I with that asset? Yes. Thanks. Look, the short answer is yes. We are thinking about opportunities that go broader to other inflammatory disease to other fibrotic diseases. I think the plan -- given the quality of the data in IBD, the playing field is very large. And so we're thinking about ways right now to narrow it down a little bit and figure out what our best lines are. And we're looking forward to sharing more of that color as soon as we can look, there's just a lot of biology to support indication expansion here. And frankly, TNA knocks down so many different targets along the inflammatory and fibrotic axis, but you can look at like we have an impact on IL-6. You can go where the 6s are. We have an impact on T&F if you look at all of the many places the TNF sander. So there's just a lot of different places to go. And I think our goal is to be smart about it to find things that benefit from the full access to find things that fit from a commercial perspective together with where we're starting and to try and learn as much as we can from small studies to guide our decisions. So that's all sort of to come soon. And I guess, Matt, as a follow-up, within the portfolio, I&I has certainly become a clear focus from a business development standpoint, obviously, bringing in 3101, you bought brepocitinib. I'm just curious at this point with the portfolio, how are you thinking about the balance between bringing in new additional assets as they potentially might become available versus pursuing some of the natural expansion opportunities or sort of just running new studies in different indications than the initial targets. Yes. Look, I think on the one hand, we are very pleased with the coherence of our late-stage portfolio and of the fact that we've built and I&I pipeline that we think is among the best out there. So I think we're proud of that. And we think insofar as opportunity begets opportunity, we will continue to get calls and look at lots of different things within I&I. That said, when we started talking about the TO18 program with Pfizer, 1402 hasn't yet presented itself, and we obviously didn't have TL1A yet, and we still had -- I think at the time, we still had our sickle cell program, and we weren't obviously an I&I company. And I think if we had said that we're something else company, we might not have had the opportunity to work on TL1A. So I guess what I'd say is the next TL1A, if it is outside of I&I, but that attractive, it's still something we will work on. So look, I think we see lots of opportunity in lots of places. We like the concentration but not so much that it would stop us from working on something else great in another area. And we see plenty of exciting things inside and outside of I&I. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Matthew Gline for any closing remarks. Yes. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for dialing in this morning and for listening.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stephanie Lee. Please go ahead. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call to review Roivant's financial results for the first quarter ended June 30, 2024, along with the business update. I'm Stephanie Lee with Roivant. Presenting today, we have Matt Gline, CEO of Roivant. For those dialing in via our conference call, you can find the slides being presented today as well as the press release announcing these updates on our IR website at www.investor.roivant.com. We'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present to help you follow along.
I'd like to remind you that we'll be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation. We strongly encourage you to review the information that we filed with the SEC for more information regarding these forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt. Great. Thanks, Steph, and thanks, everybody, for joining. It's always a pleasure to get on these calls. In truth, we saved all of our fund updates for this fall. So today is a relatively straightforward set of updates, but a couple of really meaningful clinical execution points and a couple of other things that I'm happy to be talking about. So thank you again.
I'll start just quickly on Slide 5 in the deck with a reminder. Just kind of where we are this year, which is this is a year of growth and expansion for us. So we're focused very much on delivering clinical data across multiple of our franchise, the anti-FcRn franchise, where we have some meaningful data sets that's coming as soon as -- the near future as well as over the next, call it, 6 months. We have continued clinical development beyond that in our pipeline, including in brepocitinib, where we'll be beginning our Phase III program in NIU shortly, where we have data coming in namilumab in sarcoidosis and so on.
We're very much looking forward to. We'll talk a little bit about VTAMA today, but the story for VTAMA for this year is really the expansion of the label with AD and some acceleration of [ PsO ], certainly volumes and revenues are over time. And then we continue to be hard at work expanding our pipeline, looking at mid-late-stage programs. I know there's a lot of focus on that activity. We will be unveiling our much discussed so far undisclosed program just next month, so hold on for a few more weeks there. And then continuing to work on prioritizing capital allocation, we thinking aggressively around the use of capital to continue to buy back shares and so on. 
We are super proud on Slide 6 of the pipeline as it currently stands. And one of the things that -- I'm sure sometimes you get all these questions about [ IMVT ] but every time I look at our pipeline, we still have one of the best [indiscernible] pipelines without IMVT, so excited about the breadth of opportunities there, in particular, excited about the next, call it, 18 months, both in the [ FDF ], we'll talk a lot more about today and then brepocitinib where we have pivotal data coming shortly.
So the main updates for the quarter, starting on Slide 8. One is on brepocitinib, which is that we've now completed enrollment in our Phase III study in dermatomyositis. It's 241 subjects across 90 sites, it is the largest interventional DM study ever conducted. And we can now say with confidence we expect top line data in the second half of next year, that study completed enrollment a few weeks back. And we've completed our end of Phase II meeting with FDA on the NIU opportunity and are planning to begin a 52-week Phase III study in the near future in NIU Phase III program. 
At Immunovant, we had announced that, as you may recall, a slight delay last quarter for the MG study. We can now say that, that study has completed enrollment, only a little bit behind the original schedule, and so we'll get data in the first quarter of next year, as we've previously discussed. And we remain on track for the initiation of registrational program in MG probably for next year as well as multiple other programs, we'll talk more about that in a minute. We will unveil our upcoming Phase II program, as I said, in September next month, excited to do that. It will be the combination of the presentation or some data, we will likely do a home hub like this one. So looking forward to getting together at that time.
And then a couple of other updates on Slide 9. One is just to say we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making at Genevant in our IP litigation around COVID vaccines discovery continues and you may have seen we requested a slightly many case schedule so that we could get some more information from Moderna which, if approved, beginning of the trial will be just about a year from now, so in September of 2025. And then we achieved some important clinical regulatory milestones that resulted in cash coming in the door. We're going to get a $28 million milestone related to the Japanese approval of VTAMA, we got that in July, and we have received our portion of $110 million of the remaining Roche proceeds for Telavant now that they've begun. They hit the definition for that milestone. So that has been received this month. So pleased with that. And obviously, even though $110 million still a multiple even in this milestone of the capital that we originally invested in the program. So those are the main updates for the quarter.
I want to spend a couple of minutes on some things in particular. One of them just to review where we are and our level of enthusiasm around Immunovant around the anti-FcRn opportunity. We've been having some conversations over the last few months, and it occurs to me, but I have a little bit of regret only that we've been drawn into -- as a field, I'd say, a conversation about apportionment of a small pie. One in fact, I think our view is that the biology for FcRn, the biology for B-cell immunology and beyond is very broad. So I just wanted to highlight, again, where we think we are, the amount of data that's been generated here that supports the breadth of the opportunity and a little bit of a reminder of just why we are so excited about the program.
So as a reminder, on Slide 11, look, we've said this in multiple places. We really do believe that IMVT-1402 has a potentially best-in-class profile here. That comes, obviously, first and foremost, from our ability to suppress IgG as deeply or deeper than any of the other anti-FcRn antibodies in our view, without any impacts on things like albumin and LDL, which obviously was something that affected our first generation program.
And then I think it's worth remembering we are also going to be able to launch in all likelihood IMVT-1402 in an auto-injector, it will be a simple subcutaneous injection that should enable self-administration at home, subject to FDA being okay with that. And we think that will be a really compelling format for patients and a differentiated option versus where -- certainly where the field is right now, and our sense is potentially differentiated relative to even where the field will be in a couple of years. 
There has been on Slide 12, just absolutely explosive growth over the past couple of years and the breadth of what FcRn has demonstrated. Relying back to 2020, there were eight total FcRn indications in development with about 700,000 addressable patients. There are now 23 indications in development for anti-FcRn antibodies with a current total addressable population of 4 million, and that number is growing often and we expect to add some to it in the relatively near future as well. So just a huge area of biology and a patient population that prior to this moment kind of unmet need.
On Slide 13, you can see there have now been across 22 positive late-stage studies in 9 indications, 4 different anti-FcRn antibodies have been studied at about 2,000 patients. There's a tremendous amount of data about this mechanism, some of which generated by us, its Batoclimab in Graves and Batoclimab in [indiscernible]. Some was generated by others such as in children recently. But overall, just a really compelling picture of a well-tolerated class that shows meaningful efficacy and clinical benefit in a pretty wide range at this point of diseases. So we're really excited about that.
The other piece -- I don't want to spend too much time going on this on Slide 14, is there's been a lot of interest, let's say, in competitive mechanisms, IgG degradation or some of the CAR-T or B-cell biology, T-cell engagers for autoimmune disease. I would say nothing on this slide is meant to suggest that we are not enthusiastic about much of that biology. We think it's really great biology. But I think it's been interesting to us only in the sense that it's so much earlier than FcRn. And FcRn is are elegantly cleared to this bar but there's still a lot of work to do in some of these other mechanisms. You can see here, again, multiple approvals for our class in immunology, multiple positive Phase III studies, multiple positive Phase II studies in thousands of patients.
It just sets up a different picture in terms of the level of validation and the proximity of the opportunity. And so what we're excited about that vis-a-vis our place in the competitive field. Again, we think many of these other classes are interesting, watching them closely, we make investments in other areas. And so you can imagine we're watching these areas. And we like the biology. But we feel really good about where FcRn is positioned competitively and just how different it looks in terms of stage of opportunity.
On Slide 15, everyone wants to compare themselves to the biggest drugs. And so the Humira comparison is maybe overdone, but I liked a couple of things about it here. But one of the things I liked about it is if you try and stack up where FcRn is versus where the TNF class was at various points in history, it just feels exciting to be at this stage of the biology, right? We are in a much larger set of indications than TNF were being studied in at the time and growing. FcRns have sold extremely well on a time-adjusted basis. The first FcRn approved reported about $1.2 billion in net sales in its first year post launch. And if you look at our forecast, you look at street forecasts, I think there's a chance that class will build, especially given the breadth of early development, meaningfully quicker over time, the TNFs class was able.
And I think it's notable from the competitive point, the TNF class didn't achieve these, obviously, phenomenal results just on their own, there were -- by 20 years after launch, there were 9 other approved MOAs sort of directly competing with TNFs in many of their indications and yet TNF is being a foundational class being novel biology, being well tolerated, we're able to call down a really meaningful portion of that. So I think as we look at -- and there's many other examples we couldn't take, but as we look at these other spaces, I think our view is -- the opportunity here is big. It's broad. Notably, these are not just many indications. Many of these indications are very large indications. And so we've got even success in a handful of them for any given program that can make a big impact. And indications that are big enough, as many of the TNF indications to accommodate multiple programs, multiple mechanisms. This is a big tent.
On Slide 16 has an aggressive plan. We are excited about that plan. 1402 will be in 4 to 5 potential registrational programs this fiscal year, moving up to 10 indications by next fiscal year. So 3 IND is expected to be active by the end of this calendar year. Really excited of what we're doing with 1402, what we're going to generate for data in the coming months to validate that approach. So and I'll say on Immunovant, but why don't you revisit that topic. A couple of other smaller things.
One on Slide 18, just a quick update on VTAMA $18.4 million in product revenue for the quarter, relatively flat on GTN yield. Notably, script volumes are doing actually relatively well for -- we get frequently the question, it looks flat, it looks flattish. Script volumes are up 20% year-over-year relative to the same quarter last year. They're growing single-digit percent quarter-on-quarter every quarter, and we continue to see that. So that suggests we are continuing to slowly build into the psoriasis market, and we're happy with that, and it suggests the willingness over time for this -- that behavior to change, we remain the best selling from the volume perspective, novel topical. I think in psoriasis and all that sets us up really well for, as we said before the main event, which is the launch in AD that will come after approval at the end of this year.
I think on GTN quickly because the GTN yield fluctuations have sort of obscured the overall positive trend in volume here. I'll just say, we had one payer contract that had a reset effectively earlier this year that we were not getting a rebate on last year that we are rebating now. So that resulted in bolt-on some onetime and also just like an overall reset of GTN. I expect to accrete from here, it will continue to be very [indiscernible] from here. Long term, I don't have a huge difference in my expectations, but I think this year, it will sort of build from here instead of we hope might have been a higher level. Notably net price continues to increase over time outside of that one contract. So we continue to see everything trending in the direction that we wanted to.
The key upcoming catalysts on Slide 20. First of all, not on this slide, but we'll be presenting this undisclosed program, we had some clinical data in September. Also upcoming here, we've got 1402 putting out detailed development plan information as well as data from the batoclimab study in Graves' coming this fall, we're pretty excited to put that data out there. We think Graves' is a really exciting opportunity. Namilumab, we're going to have top line data from that Phase II trial in sarcoidosis, again, not an area of great -- sort of external focus right now. But if the data are positive -- if they are positive, we're excited about what that will mean.
VTAMA, again, the big event, the atopic dermatitis label expansion, hopefully coming at the end of this year, and then by the end of the fiscal year, data from batoclimab in myasthenia gravis, as we talked about as well as data from the period 1 of the Phase IIb study in CIDP. And then by the end of fiscal year initiating 4 to 5 potential registrational programs in 1402, all of which we, together with Immunovant speaking more about in the near future.
So finally, before I wrap up this relatively quick update on Slide 22, just a financial update, I think overall, a pretty normal quarter for us from a finance perspective. We actually had net income this year this quarter of $57 million. Net revenues of $55 million, including product revenues had about $18 million. Expenses sort of within our historical balance. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents that sort of reflects the Sumitomo repurchase that we had made in April, I want to say, of last quarter. And then the carrying value of our debt has come down a bit, thanks to the renegotiation that we have done at Dermavant and you can see shares outstanding on the slide as well, about [ 739 million ].
So with that, I'll wrap up the presentation portion of this on Slide 24. You can see that we have a pretty exciting catalyst calendar coming up with, frankly, a pretty rich couple of months ahead between the unveil of the new program. I continue to work on the BD side and data coming from batoclimab generally in the coming months. So really looking forward to getting together what I'm sure will be multiple times in the next few months to talk about those updates and to continue to see this all developed.
And with that, I will wrap up the presentation for the morning. Thank you again for listening, and I'll hand it back to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Allison Bratzel of Piper Sandler. Just one for me on Priovant. Now that you've met with FDA on brepo and NIU. Just I guess what is left to be worked out or decided on the Phase III design. I think you'd given some high-level guidance looking for 300, 350-ish patients and a protocol basically as close to NEPTUNE as possible. I guess, just high level, is that still the case? And is any of this protocol design dependent on the 52-week readout later this year? And then just, I guess, on that longer-term follow-up, what would you view as an outcome that reinforces your view on the opportunity in uveitis? So look, first of all, extremely constructive interaction with FDA. I think they are really excited to see a new opportunity in NIU, which is a disease that really needs to be studied. I think we feel good about where that's headed. I'd say the previous guidance was largely in line with what we expect to see. And I think we got just about everything we really feel like we needed to make that program a success. So really, at this point, small freaks, but just getting steady up and running, and we'll be able to provide a full perception of it pretty soon here, honestly.
And then I'd say basically none of the study design hinges on the 52-week data, although obviously, we saw something surprising. We were closely at it. And I think -- I don't think there's anything in particular we're looking for in 52 weeks to reinforce the program other than continued strong benefit to patients, which, given the quality of the 24-week data we certainly expect. Our next question comes from Corinne Johnson of Goldman Sachs. This is Craig on for Corinne. So following the completion of enrollment of the VALOR study. Can you kind of outline how the final enrollment compares to your original expectations? And maybe walk us through some powering assumptions there? Sure. A couple of things. One is the actual number of patients to be enrolled at 241 was a little bit higher than our original plan for the study originally it had been 225. So we feel extremely well powered. I don't have a lot to say on like baseline characteristics or demographics right now. I think we're perfectly happy with the patients that we've enrolled and we think it sets us up well.
I guess the other comment I'll make with a shout out to the Priovant team is [ PM ] is an incredibly difficult indication in which to develop drugs, these patients are hard to find. And frankly, our experience is that the key is a lot of leg work with the sites. This is -- so we spend a lot of time about talking to investigators trying to get out there in the field to make sure that we have what we needed. And so yes, I'm very proud of the effort there. I'm proud of how quickly that study was able to get to fully enroll and looking forward to sharing that data when it's available. It's the largest as I said earlier... Just one more, if I may. Could you just remind us of what you're looking for in terms of the go, no-go decision for the Phase II namilumab data coming relatively soon? Look, I think -- we haven't articulated like a simple straightforward bar. And I think the truth is that sarcoidosis is one of these diseases where there's not a lot of other truth mechanism. There's not a lot of options for patients who were in sick with the disease. So I think the bar is meaningful. I think the bar is -- if the study works, it certainly worth progressing. As with all Phase II trials, we're going to evaluate the [ qualitative ] data and we'll think about what else is on our plate. We're also looking for consistency across not just the primary but across a few secondaries and a bunch of different ways that people look at the treatment of sarcoidosis patients. Our next question comes from Brian Cheng of JPMorgan. Maybe first is with the recent sell-off in the market, just -- does it make it easier or harder for you to find a new asset. Does it change the way how you negotiate? I will hand over to Mayukh. But the short thing I'll say is we -- look, we work with a wide range of different prospective partners. They are affected by varying degrees to the financial markets. But mostly, we're focused on getting great opportunities at prices that we're excited about. But Mayukh, what would you say to the question about the sell-off? Look, I think -- the short answer is it depends. But I think I don't know if it's too much more to add to what Matt said. So Brian, I think the short answer -- the other piece is -- sort of the question behind the question is we remain really excited with what we see in the world, and we're looking forward to doing the right deal at the right time. Maybe just one question on 1402. I guess just overall, I just want to get a better sense of how you're thinking around this asset. As we think through the 10 indications that you're lining up for through the next fiscal year, and you talked about a lot about the range of themes of opportunities that you have laid out in your slide deck today. So how do you pick and choose the different areas? And I think most importantly is how you get credits for it in front of investors because it seems that investors today are very fixated on MG and CIDP.
So in other words, how do you intend to get credits for -- to push 1402 into uncharted indications? And then maybe just one last one, more like a housekeeping one. What is the data -- what is the cadence of [ catalyst flow ] in the fall because we're going to get Phase II asset unveiling in September. Graves plan also unveiling for Immunovant and sarcoidosis data coming out. So what's the cadence of data flow? Look, unfortunately, I think the anodyne answer that's also true is obviously the biggest factor that's going to our [ picketing ] through the indications or the quality of the biology, the size of the unmet need, where we can be competitively positioned cost and risk kind of trade-offs. Like those are obviously the main factors that go in. I'd say a couple of things about 1402 that I find exciting or about the [ excellent ] landscape, and it seems like may want to jump in also.
One of the things that we've said over and over again about FcRn is that anyone's Phase II studies, everyone's Phase II study that goes both ways. It means that we need to be careful about what are made out but it means that once you know what the depth of IgG suppression does in a patient population, you could really be front of the pack. And so I think we're looking at indications where we can be in the front of the pack where we can get out there commercially and sort of be neck and neck with our competitors hopefully, with deeper IgG suppression.
So I think that's obviously a factor. For what it's worth, we also think MG is a really big opportunity. We also think CIDP is a big opportunity. And as a reminder, we're generating a meaningful data set in MG with batoclimab that will underscore and get to the more better question just in the coming months. So I think there's a lot focus on there even batoclimab focused on the existing commercial indications. I think you hit most of the point, Matt. I'd just like to way, Brian, that you framed the question, which is people are focused on MG and CIDP and everything else basically is upside. That's right. Yes. I think that's a great way to put it. And in terms of cadence of catalyst flow, look, we have a busy call it, 6 to 7 months ahead here. I'd say September will be a busy month and then the nomad data comes later this fall. And then I think we've said MG will come kind of early next year and CIDP and kind of probably a little bit thereafter. So I think that's what the sort of a medium flow looks like. And obviously, shortly on the heels of that we'll be looking at the end and beyond. Our next question comes from Dave Risinger of Leerink Partners. So I have 2 questions, please. First, could you provide more color on the LNP litigation, including the event path ahead and then second, could you discuss external transaction prospects, including the size potential of deals that you're looking at? So on the LNP litigation, again, there's not that much that we're generally able to say about an ongoing litigation. But in terms of what's coming, so we're in discovery now. And as I mentioned on the call, that process is going to continue, we hope, for a few more months, we, together with Moderna, Arbutus and Genevant have asked for a moderate extension of that process to get answers for few of your outstanding questions.
So I think that's the sort of next thing here. And then that calendar -- there's a call of the judge in the next few weeks to get that approved. But if that calendar is approved, it would have some rejudgment happening kind of in the beginning portion of next year followed by a trial a year from now. So a little bit later than the -- sort of most recent version of the calendar, but for good reason, instigated by our size. On external transaction price prospects, I guess I'll hand over to Mayukh to answer that question straight from the source. So I think we have carefully avoided I think, getting bucketed whenever sort of asked and I think that, that continues, I think -- so I would think about size of opportunity I think that we're looking at. We really think about this, I think, as you know, Dave, as a portfolio. And so there's going to be [ 180 ] in any one deal. But I think overall, I think, obviously, our -- so we think about things kind of on a deal-by-deal basis, really through that investment lens, it's a good investment but then over sort of the surface area of all those deals, we're looking to move the needle on our enterprise overall. The only thing I'd add is because we have the question sometimes, I'm always surprised when I get it. I think we are a very unlikely buyer of multibillion dollar public companies. I think we are stingy by nature and are looking for places where we can spend more of the dollars on clinical development. So we are never saying never company, but I think that's just truly about who we are. Our next question comes from Dennis Ding of Jefferies. Two for me. So maybe if we can revisit sarcoidosis briefly. Correct me if I'm wrong, but previously, you may have characterized the Phase II is potentially registrational. Can you reiterate that and see and confirm if that's true? Maybe talk a little bit about the path forward if that data is positive. And then #2, around OpEx. I mean, given Immunovant started a bunch of new trials over the next few years, how do you think your OpEx will evolve during that time? Look, we are -- on sarcoidosis, the truth is it's a Phase II study. It's 100 patients. It's certainly large enough to serve as at least a pivotal study. if successful and obviously many patients with high unmet needs. So depending on the quality of the data that there's always a conversation to have with the regulators. But then I think our expectation is that it's a Phase II study, and we would have a program behind it, invest in all scenarios, and we're just excited to be developing the disease. There are no approved agents outside of steroids. So the unmet is really significant.
On the Immunovant question, look, I think the short answer to the question on its phase is given the Immunovant is starting a number of pivotal studies, I would expect their OpEx to increase. I don't have super specific financial guidance right now to offer the cost of a Phase III program for an FcRn in general has ranged from, call it, $80 million to $120 million. And so over the life of those programs, I think those are like reasonable estimates, plus overhead personnel and stuff like that.
So I'd expect the firm to go up there over time. Obviously, if you look at some of our competitors, I'd say like their R&D expenses may be useful, but a big piece of the cost here ultimately lines up come in as we get closer to a commercial launch from a G&A perspective as well. And notably, Immunovant is well capitalized right now for this program, and we are obviously excited to be a good partner for them. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of TD Cowen. I have a couple. Maybe just the first one, we started getting questions, and I think you highlighted now that you're planning on unveiling your recently in-licensed Phase II program in September. Is there anything you can unveil a little bit today. Just indication or how big is the study? Is it a randomized study? Is it just an open-label study? Has there been other studies with this mechanism in whatever indication you're examining. And then maybe just secondly, so it sounds like GMG and CIDP will start Phase III, let's say, Q1 potentially with 1402. For the other 3, is it sort of Graves',  Sjogren’s and maybe [ Ted ], is that sort of the order? On those sort of assets we're weeks away. So I think I'm going to mostly reserve comment other than to reiterate some things we've already said, mainly, first of all, obviously, we're excited about the program. There is clinical data to share when we released the program. That clinical data, I think, is useful and people will find it informative. And there is a competitor program -- there's another program of the same mechanism being studied by a big pharma company to different indication. We've said that publicly before. And other than that, we'll reserve comment until we unveil the rest in September, but looking forward to it.
Of the programs that we've sort of described, obviously, the Graves' data is coming shortly and we expect both to communicate talking about data as well as the development plan for that program. And then the MG data and CIDP are coming to begin next year, and we've said clearly in a firm study in MG. We haven't said exactly what the other indications are yet. I think in Immunovant will paint a fulsome picture of that relatively soon. But my expectation, to be clear, is the Phase III studies for some of those programs. Again, we expect to have 3 INDs by the end of this year. All of those INDs will be for registrational sort of Phase II/III kind of programs. And so I would expect that with these studies to -- in essence have been done by the end of this year and the other 2 in the first quarter. Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Cantor. I had 2 for you. The first one I wanted to ask you is if the launch of FcRn is a possibility just for Roivant to do on its own. Is that on the table? And then secondly, just curious on the market opportunity for VTAMA and AD and how you're preparing for the launch of this product coming at the end of this year? On the first question, I'll say we are certainly aware of a -- once upon a time a small biotech company that launched an anti-FcRn antibody on its own and had some success doing so. And so it certainly seems possible to do that ourselves. And look, I think that has been an exciting outcome. I think as the class presents itself, the breadth of the opportunity is large. So I think we're going to do what maximizes the value of that opportunity for us. And beyond that, all things are on the table.
On VTAMA and AD. Look, I think there's a couple of things. One is probably most importantly, looking for the prescribers who were not currently in front of, how are just pediatric allergists, pediatric dermatologists really hitting hard impedes where we'll be alone at launch among novel topicals. So I think that's sure that prep is important. And then looking -- hitting a hard look at our existing sales force targeting and making sure that we're covering all the right docs for the opportunity and getting our messaging exactly right to those docs, especially frankly, because, look, I think the story in AD is a little bit different than the story they're used to seeing in psoriasis, right? I think like the pediatric population is different. The safety -- the tolerability profile, I should say, of the drug is even better in the AD ta set.
I think the quality of our data in AD is differentiated to an even greater degree relative to some of the other novel topicals than it is in psoriasis. And so I think we need to get that across is, for example, is a major symptom in AD it's acute. Its data is very, very good and I think we'll be making sure to highlight that. So I think really trying to get messaging with all docs, right, make sure we're talking to the right docs to make sure we're especially covering the docs or not kind of overlapping with the psoriasis docs that we're so ready to get out in front of those as soon as we get that on from FDA. Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja of Guggenheim. Maybe just one more on VTAMA, specifically on the psoriasis side, I mean if you look at the past, I would say, 4, 5 quarters, you are in that $18 million to $20 million range on a quarterly basis. I mean what does that imply about the overall market opportunity? What can you do to sort of reinflect sales in psoriasis? I understand you atopic dermatitis could give a lift, but just in psoriasis, just curious how you view the market, what sort of peak sales you are assuming? First of all, I'll say I continue to be pleased with how we're set up on VTAMA, which is to say, industry gives us no credit for it. So I think it's all upside from here, which is always a nice place to be. Look, I think on the -- sort of tracking the progress as it were, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think the -- sort of mechanical sales number probably understates the progression in the sense that we had a little bit of -- just noise around gross to net that we expect to climb out of from here.
And volumes are actually building and people have been asking us about the supposed of flattening of this curve for a while, were up 20% from a volumes perspective versus the same quarter last year and continuing to grow every quarter. I think as GTN climbs, as GTN normalizes, that sort of base that we've been building month in, month out, quarter in and quarter out from a volume perspective, we'll continue to work for us.
And I still have hope that over time, there will be some real compounding effects there, the docs that like the product, the docs that write the product, we'll continue to write it more and more. So I do think psoriasis has the potential to be very meaningful over time. It's just been a little bit of a slower burn. And I think the thing about AD is it's got the potential to be like the inflection of a different sort, which is a much larger patient population with a set of data that we think is sort of easier based on what we see the differences versus our peers. And so excited for that launch as well. Our next question comes from Douglas Tsao of H.C. Wainright. Matt, I think from a business development standpoint, you have largely focused on pulling individual assets out, just given the sort of ongoing status in biotech, does it ever change that you become more focused on looking at potentially acquiring companies? We are generally just agnostic to the form in which great programs come our way. And so I think whether it's a company, whether it's an asset, I don't know if that's like the dividing line for us versus what are we getting and here's the value there? And do we think we can do something that matters with that. Mayukh, you got anything you'd add to that? I think you got it. Yes. So I think the answer to that question is we've always sort of been indifferent to that. I think there's -- I guess the only thing I'll say is like I think a lot of what we are focused on right now, I'd say the vast majority of what we're focused on right now is stuff that's in clinical development. And so when we talk about companies versus assets, I don't think it matters so much, whether it's company or asset, but we're honestly going to be looking at companies in that clinical stage or sort of development stage programs. Our next question comes from Andy Chen of Wolfe Research. One more question about VTAMA. Can you talk about specifically how you view competitive dynamics between you and your competition such as [indiscernible] and insight which patients do you think is going to prefer which product? And then on a related note and your pre-approval engagement work with PBMs do you foresee getting hit on gross to net if they prefer your competition? I want to give your special thanks because I think the analysts who come late in the rotation on these calls have a lot of work to do. So I appreciate the thoughtful question late in the morning. Look, on the first question, the key thing about these markets, which we've said from the beginning is the competition is not other novel agents. The competition is steroids. There are many, many steroid scripts written. And the challenge is in changing well in grain dock behavior. I don't think, in general, it's like for the medium psoriasis or the median AD patients. It's like, oh, some docs sitting there and carefully thinking about the attributes absorbing versus Opzelura versus VTAMA and deciding on a patient-by-patient basis to give one or the other. I think the key point is getting docs comfortable that they have things to reach for.
There are differences. In AD, for example, we would hope for a label all the way down to A2. I think our competitors don't have labels that cover anything like quite that young. So I think there are opportunities to address patient populations that are different there. I think once-a-day application in AD is probably helpful, the consistency of formulation, the fact that it's a single concentration whereas at least one of our competitors has a couple of different concentrations going to be on the market. I think those things are all helpful, but it's not about like segmenting versus the other novel topicals per se. That's not sort of the major challenge mostly.
And on the sort of PBM side, I think the short answer is commercially insured patients should have coverage for VTAMA under our current match care agreements. So I don't expect any super significant changes in the GTN or commercial dynamics on AD approval, which is a great question. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Matt Gline for closing remarks. Look, yes, thank you, everybody. Thank you to all of our analysts for the great questions. Thank you, everyone, for dialing in for a relatively flat quarterly update. I'm looking forward to getting back on the phone in the coming weeks with some other things to share. And thanks to the Roivant team, thanks to those folks [indiscernible]. Thanks to all the patients and investigators who trust us and work with us. And we will talk to you very soon. Have a great day. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",the first quarter of 2024 earnings call is being recorded . today's call is to review Roivant's financial results . we'll also be providing the current slide numbers as we present .,1.0
