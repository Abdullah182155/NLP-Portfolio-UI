I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings call. We have Jack and Sarah with us today.
First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions asked from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason. And thank you all for joining us.
In the first quarter, we once again accelerated growth at scale. Total net revenue grew 45% year-over-year and adjusted revenue grew 51% year-over-year, up from 36% and 47% respectively in the fourth quarter of 2017.
I also want to highlight our progress on omnichannel, global expansion and larger sellers. Enabling sellers to reach buyers wherever they are, omnichannel commerce is our top priority for 2018. Last week, we entered into an agreement to acquire Weebly, a technology company that allows anyone to easily build the professional website or online store. We’ve had a partnership with Weebly for several years, and our two companies are very aligned and that we both want to build powerful, accessible tools that help entrepreneurs succeed. Combining with Weebly, we will provide sellers with one cohesive solution to start or grow in omnichannel business. Additionally, nearly 40% of Weebly’s paid subscribers are outside the United States, which help us accelerate our global expansion.
In the UK, we launched two of our fastest growing services this quarter, Instant Deposit and Cash App. With Instant Deposit, sellers in the UK can now receive their money in minutes at the tap of a button even outside business hours. We know that sellers everywhere value speed, particularly when it comes to their money.
In the first quarter, Cash App was regularly a top 25 app in the free app store. This ranking along with the top cash card uses we see like McDonald’s and Walmart, demonstrate Cash App’s mainstream usage. Similar to the U.S., we see an opportunity in the UK to expand the suite of financial services we offer and we’re excited to bring Cash App to more people around the world.
And finally, as we’ve grown up market, we found that larger businesses like other sellers choose Square because they value that cohesion of our ecosystem. More than half of our larger sellers used two or more Square products during 2017. This is important because as the sellers use more products, we deepen our relationship with them. And in turn, they drive meaningful growth for Square. In the first quarter, total net revenue from larger sellers grew 47% year-over-year, and adjusted revenue grew 60% year-over-year. We’re really proud of our first quarter results. And thank you as always to our Square sellers for making us better.
I’ll now turn it over to Sarah for some more detailed remarks on our financials. Thank you, Jack.
In the first quarter, we continued to accelerate growth at scale. Q1 GPV was approximately $18 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Adjusted revenue increased 51% on a year-over-year basis compared to 47% in Q4 and 39% a year-ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $36 million this quarter, a 12% adjusted EBITDA margin as we continue to reinvest in the business to drive growth and scale. We continue to drive momentum and transaction-based profit. Transaction based profit as a percentage of GPV improved to 1.09% as we continue to benefit from higher margin products and improvements in our transaction cost profile. GPV from higher margin products, invoices virtual terminal and e-commerce API payments doubled year-over-year.
We also saw strong momentum in subscription and services based revenue, which nearly doubled year-over-year and represented 32% of adjusted revenue, up from 24% a year-ago. Growth was driven by Instant Deposits, showing both seller and consumer traction, Caviar and Square Capital. Building on the momentum noted in Q4, Cash Card is also becoming a more meaningful contributor to subscription and services based revenue as consumers benefit from the utility of paying both online and offline. The recent launch of Square Register drove hardware revenue growth of 60% on a year-over-year basis. The product is resonating with larger sellers as the average annualized GPV of a Square Register seller is over $300,000.
I’ll now take a moment to walk through our accounting treatment of Bitcoin. As a reminder, in January, we fully launched the ability for Cash App customers to buy and sell Bitcoin. In compliance with the U.S. GAAP, all Bitcoin revenue and costs related to Cash App activity are recorded as follows. Bitcoin revenue is a total sale amount of Bitcoin to customers. Bitcoin costs are the total amount of Bitcoin that we purchase in order to facilitate the buying of Bitcoin by customers. Our adjusted revenue from Bitcoin is our Bitcoin revenue minus our Bitcoin costs. Bitcoin revenue contributed $34.1 million to total net revenue in the first quarter. Bitcoin cost was $33.9 million resulting in a minor add to adjusted revenue of $200,000.
GAAP net loss in the first quarter was $24 million compared to a net loss of $15 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share basic and diluted was $0.06 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss per share of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $36 million this quarter compared to $27 million in the first quarter of 2017, growing 33% year-over-year.
I’ll now turn to full year guidance. For more details regarding second quarter guidance, please refer to our shareholder letter. We are raising our full year guidance for total net revenue and adjusted revenue to reflect the ongoing momentum of our business and the acquisition of Zesty which closed on April 19th. Full year guidance does not include the impact of the acquisition of Weebly. We will update our guidance after the completion of the transaction, which is expected to close during the second quarter.
For full year 2018, we expect total net revenue to be within a range of $3.0 billion to $3.06 billion and adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.40 billion to $1.43 billion. At the midpoint, this represents 44% year-over-year adjusted revenue growth, up from 34% growth in our previous guidance.
Given the significant market opportunity ahead of us, we will continue to reinvest in our business to drive long-term growth and thus are maintaining our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $240 million to $250 million. We expect GAAP net loss per share to be within the range of negative $0.04 to break even, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of positive $0.44 to positive $0.48.
So, with that, let me turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask on Weebly. I guess, big question is, just why own this asset versus being the partner with Weebly? And also, do you feel like you have the assets in place to be competitive in omni commerce? Do you need to add scale in other areas like maybe gateway or e-commerce platform or an app developer community et cetera? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Yes. Thanks for the questions. So, we have been partnering with Weebly for quite some time and we realized that we had an opportunity to move much faster and deliver a much more cohesive and seamless experience if we were to get the two companies together. We only did this because we saw real alignment with our purpose. We saw an alignment in terms of roadmap and we’ve really battletested the relationship for quite some time. So, we feel really good about where that is and where it could go. In terms of other gaps that we’re looking to fill, we have a lot of strength around our Square platform. And we intend to move very, very quickly as we continue to look out and push on that roadmap. But, this is a huge building block for us that we can now offer our sellers an easy way with minimal hassle to sell both online and offline. So, this is a big step, but it is something that we’re going to have to continue to work and continue to reiterate but really proud of where we are. Your next question comes from the line of Pedro [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yes. Hi, Jack. Hey, guys. I’m a Square seller here and [indiscernible] San Francisco. One of the questions I really do want to ask here is, would Square consider partnering with commercial properties to create space for sellers to have more pop-ups for to bring back kind of the mom and pop here in the Bay Area? Thank you for the question, Pedro, and also thank you for being a Square customer. We have looked at this in the past, in New York in particular and we’re certainly open to some creativity here. We’ll consider this more and figure out the right approach, but we want to make sure that we are supporting all of our sellers and sometimes that means getting deeper into the physical communities I’m not there in. But we’ll keep you updated. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Guys, good afternoon. So, I just wanted to ask about the -- obviously the updated guidance implies you’re basically taking the $100 million in upside on adjusted revenue for this year. You’re reinvesting it all back into the business. So, maybe just talk a little bit about the split of those investments between product development, sales and marketing, any other texture. And then, if you can also, Sarah, just give us a sense of what Zesty is going to contribute to 2018 adjusted revenue and EBITDA? Thank you. Great, thanks, Jason. So, I think, it’s worth just noting, we’re so delighted with our top-line growth rate you saw in Q1, 51% year-over-year and the fact that we’re now guiding you to 44% on the top-line that’s actually up 10 points since the guidance we gave you about 90 days ago. I’ll answer your Zesty question in there. So, Zesty is probably one to two points of adjusted revenue growth, but the rest is just continued outperformance from the core. So, I think that’s an amazing outcome. We’re in this enviable position frankly right now where we have many strong ROI positive investment opportunities available to us. And the key for us as a team is always how do we sequence and prioritize those. So, that’s why you saw us talk about at the beginning of the year, omnichannel, financial services, and international as really what we wanted to focus in on for 2018.
On top of that, in terms of where we’ll put our money, so, the first is always how do we build remarkable products that are going to drive customer growth and then ultimately revenue growth. So, you will of course see us come back to product developments. That’s usually hiring great engineers, great data scientists, great designers, like all of the pieces that come together to give us a remarkable product that give us things like a net promoter score of 70 here in the United States. So, that is one area focus for the investment.
The second is sales and marketing. So, we continue to see a payback period of around three to four quarters, so, massive efficiency from sales marketing perspective. And so we want to go keep putting dollars back to work because again we can grow the ecosystem and we think that that over the long run is what will really maximize shareholder value frankly. Also within sales and marketing is the spend that we’re doing around Cash Approximately. So don’t forget that. Cash App, we talked about last quarter $7 million monthly active. We’ve continued to be a top 25 app in the App Store; if you look today, we’re right up into the mid-teens, so, becoming an app that people are using even daily. And so, we want to keep going after that ecosystem too. And so that’s another area of investment from a sales and marketing standpoint. G&A, our goal there is efficiency. You can even see in Q1 that G&A was our slowest growing, cost line item as it should be. That efficiency gets driven by investing in technology there too. So, places like customer success, sales, account management, we can utilize machine learning to drive more efficiency there, so that we are melding people and technology to give our customers a great ultimate outcome. So hopefully that helps with how we are thinking about that reinvestment back into the business. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I had a question also on Weebly. And in the context, it clearly helps you guys extend outside, you have 625,000 paid subs. One of the questions I have though is just thinking through their acquisition model a little bit, cost associated with their customer acquisition cost, how that might change, maybe even materially if you layer that on as opposed to partnership strategy versus -- that we have had in the past or ownership strategy or partnership strategy? So, we have no plans to change the model currently. As we close the deal and complete the integration, we are going to make sure that we are putting our customers first and really understanding how to build off the channel they’ve already built. And there is obviously a lot of paths we can take and some options. But, we don’t want to get too deep into it until we start really understanding and looking at what is optimal for our sellers. And the whole goal of this ultimately is to introduce sellers to our larger ecosystem, to all of our suits of tools and services, and what is the fastest path to do that. We continue to see a lot of benefit from sellers, both small and large, utilizing two or more of our products and our services. And this is another great opportunity to serve even more customers around the world. Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack, I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the traction that some of your software packages such as Square for Retail or even maybe the back office functions of our Square Register are getting in the market. Any metrics you can provide in terms of how much uptick those particular packages have gotten? And then, as you look forward to what extent do you intend on rolling out additional vertical specific things such as for QSR or health and beauty and other verticals? So, Jim, let me grab the question on traction. I think, one way you see that is in the growth of larger sellers. So, as we have talked about it before from a product standpoint as we go after our larger sellers, and they grew quite nicely in the quarter, almost 60% is the number that we put in on adjusted from an adjusted revenue perspective. There is multiple ways that we target and continue to resonate as we move upmarket. The first is through hardware. And we talked a little bit about the success of Square Register in the quarter, and actually pleasing to see a third of Square Register customers actually were net new to Square. So that’s actually opening up a whole new front door for us.
Layer on top of that software and kind of where you’re going with your question, so, the need to be more vertical specific. One of the strengths of Square is clearly the diversity of the base that we have. So, we see customers in retail, it’s about 20% of GPV; we see customers in food, also about 20% of GPV; services, so professional services, health and beauty also kind of getting into high teens, and I could go on, but the point being lots of diversity in the installed base. As you get into bigger customers and each of those verticals, they have some very specific things they need for their setting. So, in the case of retail, more inventory, a much more CRM forward point of sale. That’s what we launched when we launched Square for Retail. And so, that manifests effectively in our subscription services line, one of the many reasons that it’s growing, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.
In terms of other verticals, that’s a place where we’ve used the partnership strategy. So, believe it’s a good example of us partnering on the e-com side. But if you were to look in areas like food, TouchBistro is in there; on the retail side Vend is in there. So, when we can fully satisfy the customer, we want to make sure they can still use Square’s platform. And so, that’s where the opening API strategy really comes into its own. So, it is a -- both a build and a partner. So first and the third party strategy that we think will be the most successful ultimately for sellers. That’s helpful. And then, maybe could you follow up on the margin outlook? Clearly, raising revenues but not adjusted EBITDA. You talked about some of the growth potential you see and obviously the top-line growth is very strong. Any kind of commentary you can provide on the sort of longer term 500 basis points kind of margin expansion goals you would outlined over the past couple of years, and whether that’s changing at all. So, I think it’s always a balance. When you’re growing at the pace that we’re growing at, so over 50% this quarter, clearly that’s signaling that we have a lot of potential ideas in front of us right now. And so, we don’t want to go short on the investment there, because the more we grow the ecosystem, bring sellers onto the platform, that provides a base that we can then go upsell and cross sell into. So, as Jack mentioned, particularly as larger sellers, they are using two or more products. And we think we have a lot of greenfield opportunity to go back in with products like loyalty or appointments if you’re a services customer or payroll broadly. And so, getting folks into the ecosystem first and foremost is incredibly important to building the long-term platform for Square.
So, I want to balance that out. We’re still showing for the year, I think a very healthy margin expansion for 2018, so growing at 44% and yet still giving you $240 million to $250 million of EBITDA. There is lots of ways to change that EBITDA over time. One is continuing to accelerate on the top-line and the second of course will be to get more efficient from a cost perspective. And I think depending on where our growth is panning out, we will pull those levers in different -- to different degrees, depending on the environment that we’re in. But right now, we just feel so good about our business that we think the right thing to do is to keep reinvesting for that long-term platform growth. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Your line is open. Hi, thanks. I have a question related to the ILC application. I’m wondering if you can give us an update on that process, and when we maybe get some additional news. And I think as part of that you’d always talked about it was important to you to get that if you could to improve your relationship with regulators et cetera. But how are you thinking about the opportunities from incremental business perspective and the things that you could do differently if you had that ILC license? Thanks. Yes. So, we don’t have an update to provide you today. But just to remind folks of the goal of the ILC. So, the ILC, the reason we’re doing this is to create more efficiencies within the Square Capital potentially, bring lending capabilities of a bank in-house and allowing us to engage directly with regulatory bodies. However, I will note that like our business is not dependent upon us getting it. It is one such strategy that we’re pursuing. We’re also working with bank partners, investors and agencies to facilitate the continued growth of the Square Capital business. So, no update today, but we continue to push and make sure that we are creating more efficiencies and giving ourselves a lot more optionality to grow the Square Capital business, That’s the goal. Your next question comes from the line of Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, guys. I just want to ask about subscription and services; it accelerated again on a year-over-year basis. So, just thinking about what’s pushing that growth rate higher? And then, one clarification on the guidance. I think, at the Analyst Day, almost a year ago, you talked about long-term revenue growth of 20% to 25%. I’m guessing if you’re making these investments and that number is probably a stale number and the growth rate goes higher based upon looking forward on where the growth could go? Thanks. Yes. So first, just on the subscription services business, yes, I mean, kind of an amazing outcome to see it accelerate to 98% year-over-year. If you look within that line item, the top three contributors today are Instant Deposit, Caviar and Capital. Instant Deposit, as you know is something that we offer both to our sellers and to the consumers within Cash App. And speed just is important, regardless of who you are. Whether you’re a small business, a large business or a consumer, people want to access to their money. And so, it’s been a really good monetization engine for Cash App and it’s just been a great way to make sure our sellers are getting capital more quickly, so they can invest in their business.
Caviar continues to perform very strongly. We’re seeing growth in both in the number of orders and in the average ticket size. It’s the reason why we continue to go back and invest in that business because we think we’re doing something very different here. We’re partnering with our sellers. And delivery and pick up become another way for them to grow their business. It’s effectively the omnichannel play for food.
And then, on the Square Capital side, as you saw in the quarter, originations of $339 million grew 35% year-over-year. What I’m actually even more proud of with Capital is that we have now facilitated about $2.8 billion of loans into those small businesses and they just don’t have another way to get access to that sort of capital. And when they get it, they invest in their business; when their business grows, our business grows. So, three really strong areas overall that is driving that continued acceleration.
In terms of the guidance question, for sure, like when you look at the long-term revenue growth rate target of 20% to 25%, but we’re telling you for this year that we can grow at 44% just at the midpoint of guidance, we’re well ahead of anything that we talked to you about a year ago. In fact at 44% at the midpoint for 2018 what that would actually mean we would grow faster in 2018 than we did in 2017. And that’s really I think amazing scale. So, happy with how the ecosystem is building right now. Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple on Bitcoin. Could you walk us through your sort of broad approach to risk management with that functionality, whether it’s risk of fraud or currency volatility that you might be holding or legal regulatory risk or impact on liquidity or any way that that sort of affects your model? And then, as a follow-up, Jack, you’ve been pretty vocal on the future utility of cryptocurrency outside of this Bitcoin App, are there other corporate uses for blockchain technology that you’re excited about or that you’re looking at internally? Sure. Ramsey, let me take the first question around risk management and so on from a Bitcoin perspective. So risk management just generally at Square, right, it’s where we began. I think, we had a very unique view of risk, which allowed us to onboard sellers in minutes. And we invested in that from the get-go to kind of deep machine learning. And it’s one of the reasons why you’ve seen core loss rates stay in the sub kind of 10 basis points of GPV. We take it super seriously. Form an overall -- from a Bitcoin perspective, there is really no difference to the approach, right. We are constantly investing from a security and infotech standpoint. There is never kind of end to that journey. It’s coastally iterating to make sure that we are staying one step ahead in terms of the fraud vectors that could happen. From a regulatory standpoint it’s the same answer. We do everything we can to make sure we are staying close to all of the different regulatory bodies that we work with across all forms of money movement, and I don’t think Bitcoin is any different there. And in terms of the blockchain, yes, I mean, there is no other technology apart from artificial intelligence and machine learning and deep learning that affects the way we can operate our service and the way we can build our business. [Technical Difficulty] out and we’ve built a service that individuals can use, providing more access to more people around this technology and this implementation. And because we are connected directly to the blockchain and using it every single minute of every single day, we have been able to learn quite quickly and how it could impact the rest of our business as well. There is certainly a ton of applications around creating more efficiencies within our business, but also creating new opportunities as well. So, we are still in a learning phase of where we can apply it in the right way because we don’t just want to purely apply the technology where it doesn’t fit but making sure we are actually solving a real need and a real problem whether that be internal or external. But, we do carry a lot of -- we do have a lot of excitement for what it can do. And we are building a significant expertise within the Company to do that. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I wanted to ask a higher level industry question on small business tech suppliers. So, do you envision sellers working with a brick-and-mortar specialist and then separately in e-commerce platform or do you think with Weebly you can become a bit of a one-stop shop and address all of their needs? Our intention is to become one place, so they don’t have to think about brick and mortar or online, all they have to think about is what they are selling and how they attract more customers. So, we recognized an opportunity with Weebly through our partnership over the years to bring these two things together. And we see it as an opportunity both to accelerate towards that goal of not having our sellers think about where the customer is coming from, but also a way to deepen that as well. So, we were really inspired by the team and the potential that they brought to the Company, and we think we bring a lot to them as well. So, definitely excited about where that ends up but ultimately goal is that a seller never has to think about where a customer comes from, whether it would be online or offline, they are just going to a shop or seller they love and purchase it. Yes. And Josh, I’d just add to it. I wouldn’t think of it as something net new. Recall, if you’re a hair salon, today you can already book an appointment online. In fact, we know that 50% of the buyers on our appointments app, book outside of business hours. So, they are effectively coming to that seller in an online mode. But then of course, they walk into the salon in order to get their haircuts or whatever. But on top of that they may not buy shampoo or conditioner or whatever they want. So they’ve become almost a pseudo retail store. And if they want to buy that in the store, we can be there to help take that payment. If they want to buy it online and get shipped, we can be there to take that payment. So, a lot of this is already happening. And I think one of the things with omnichannel is people overly define it as retail and it’s not happening regardless of what’s seller you’re in. And they overly define it as e-commerce and it’s not. Your buyer is going to be everywhere. In offline mode, they might be in your store, they might be at your pop-up, you might be in their house if you’re a plumber. They also are showing up in not just your e-commerce store, but they might show up in a marketplace like Caviar. So, it’s really multi-dimensional. And I think Square’s strength here is the breadth that we bring across all of those dimensions. Very helpful. And maybe if you could just quickly give us an update on the international opportunity and where we are and what milestones we should be watching for there? Yes. So, one of the goals we set at the beginning of the year is to make sure that we continue to add strength in the markets that we’re currently in. So, we have a significant focus on Canada, the UK, Australia and Japan, completing the offering in all the markets, bringing more of our ecosystem to each one and that will continue to be the focus. Weebly does add a new dimension, given that so many of their customers are outside of the United States. In fact, 40% of their paid subscribers are outside the United States. So, we’re definitely going to make sure that we can benefit and serve more people. It may accelerate some of our thinking. But right now, the focus is on those top markets to make sure we see continued building strength in each one. The next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Good afternoon, thanks for the question. I’d just like to clarify, Jack, what’s the opportunity here? Is it Square users moving to Weebly or to an e-commerce platform, promoting it that way or is it the other way around, more Weebly users coming on to the Square platform? And then, on top of that, I guess, as it relates to reports that Amazon is going to offer discounts to merchants on their cost of payments, does that change your calculus at all as how you think about building out an e-commerce arm? So, to answer your first question and to bit of both, we don’t see a lot of overlap between our seller base. So, we do see a lot of potential in terms of strength of getting the two companies together. So, with every one of our services, we see it as a potential acquisition channel to introduce the people to the broader ecosystem. And that is our key differentiator. As Sarah said, it’s not just about retail sellers but anything that you sell, we have an offering for and Weebly enables that on the online side. And obviously we have a number on the offline side. So, bringing these together allows us to benefit both. Sometimes we’ll have offline sellers come in and they want to sale online and vice versa. So, we’re also excited that the fact that we don’t already see a huge overlap in our seller base.
In terms of our Amazon Pay and the impact, we have seen a lot of competitors and peers enter into our space with the one particular dynamic. And we continue to see a lot of strength around our core differentiator, which is the cohesion of our ecosystem. So, we haven’t seen a lot of folks match that. And when we do have new entrants and newer approaches, we see some sellers try it, but then ultimately come back to us because of cohesion. So, we’re going to continue to push out and build into the cohesion of our services because we’re optimizing around what are the most critical needs for a seller and how do we make that easy for our sellers without seeing any SEMs whatsoever, so they can just focus on their customer base. The next question comes from line of Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I appreciated the new disclosures on Square Register. I was just wondering if you comment a little bit in terms of how to move upmarket is going so far. In other words, is there anything in particular that you hear from merchants, maybe just qualitative feedback as to how, and why the Register is differentiated, is it useful for us to be able to compare Register versus other products? Just curious what the qualitative feedback is that you’ve got on so far. Sure. So, really nice to see hardware growth, as I mentioned growth of 50% year-over-year. Now part of that is Square Register, but clearly the other hardware products continue to resonate well in the base and then bringing in new sellers. I think, what we’re seeing in our move upmarket is large merchants are really not different from the small and the micro. They’re coming to Square because of the one stop, the cohesiveness that Jack talked about. They value that, they value speed, they value kind of the elegance and the simplicity of the whole offering. We see that because, first of all, they want that hardware. And what they’ve loved about Square Register has been speed. So, really fast speed in line, so you can swipe, tap, dip whatever it is you want to do to pay, but do it probably the fastest of any technology out there.
Second, they’ve really liked the buyer facing screen because it really draws the buyer into much more of an engagement with the seller, with the seller’s brand. We’ve added in things like loyalty and some of our other software solutions to kind of really emphasize that connection between the buyer and the seller.
And then, I think the third thing that they have liked is just that it is one stop that they’re not having to deal with putting hardware and software together, it’s all coming from Square. So that has really resonated.
Beyond that, I would remind you that larger sellers also tend to just come to Square like micro. So, over 80% self-onboard, which is a huge stat that tells you of how seamless and how easy to use the technology is. And that’s great for us because that means that they’re just getting up and going quickly and they’re not having to engage per se with our sales or our account management team, and we love that. About a third of the orders are net new to Square. The fact that the GPV is about $300,000, that means that they’re relatively larger seller, relative to our base right now. And then, if you look at the categories that we’re selling into food, we’re selling into services, we’re selling into retail. So, again, it’s doubling down on the diversity that we see overall in the installed base. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you. I’ve got a follow-up on the crypto strategy, if you would. Can you give some color on who that is attracting to your bringing it -- is the reason to bring people into the ecosystem or is there -- what is the broader long-term strategy? Who are the customers coming? There’s obviously a lot of places to trade cryptocurrencies, why Square and who are these people, why they come into square and what’s the strategy with the overall ecosystem? Thank you for the question. So overall, our strategy is to provide access to complex financial systems. That is what made the Company relevant in the first place and we continue to see that not just from the seller side, but also in individual side. So, we have built this into Cash App. This is a very different demographic and very different customer base than the majority of the crypto exchanges. We have focused on one cryptocurrency which is Bitcoin. And we wanted initially to provide a safe way to participate in this, if people chose. So, it’s a demographic that typically would not be able to use other exchanges or would find those complicated and something that we wanted to make super easy, but at the same time, continue to protect and make it safe.
In terms of the strategy long-term, the first step we wanted to take is to learn as quickly as possible, to offer something that people would find valuable. And we do see that -- we did see -- reason we started this initially is because we did see cash customers wanting to buy crypto, utilizing their cash accounts. So, we made that a little bit easier. But we want to learn what this meant for us as a company and also for our industry and really pushed ourselves a lot to make sure that we were best in class in terms of providing a simple easy of exchange and then we can build off of that. There is obviously a lot of benefits as more of the spreads and we can better utilize blockchain technologies, both internally and externally. But also made -- the strategy was to provide a simple service that people would value and also be able to learn as quickly as possible. So, we’ve become experts in how this technology is going to impact our world and our industry and also that we continue to be leaders in that. I guess a follow-up question, the sub and services revenue, as you pointed, Sarah, has grown pretty dramatically, but even quarter over quarter, $79 million in the fourth quarter to $97 million in the first quarter. And the Square Capital only added about $2 million as we think of that incremental. Is Instant Deposit looking sequential momentum base, is that the main driver of that type of growth or what is it? So, Instant Deposit is definitely a key area of growth and that is because it’s working both for our sellers, but it is also part of the growth that we’re seeing in Cash App. And so, I think that’s definitely an indicator of just how well that Cash App ecosystem is growing. But, I wouldn’t underestimate just the growth that we are seeing in areas like Caviar, for example. And then beyond that clearly, there is a lot of other line items in there from our other software products, so whether it’s products like our CRM, our loyalty, employee management, payroll, there is a lot of pieces of the puzzle that we are bringing together now for sellers; to Jack’s point, to make sure they can focus on what they do, which is making their product and then selling their product. And so, we just want to make sure that when they come to Square, they can hand over all of the operational components and really just get on with what they do best. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open. I was wondering if you could talk about any progress you’re making moving upstream. It seems like you continue to widen your competitive market. Maybe you could talk about the average size of the customers as well. Sure. So, I mean, to add to some of the color that I’ve given, on the larger seller side, in totality, we’re not seeing larger sellers comprised about 47% of GPV. Typically, actually, as you go from Q4 into Q1, some as you can see a little bit of a sequential downtick on that just because larger sellers, they see a bump coming through the holiday period, and some of them may tip back into being more seen as smaller seller. So, the fact that it’s stayed consistent Q4 to Q1, I actually view as a really strong data point on that move upmarket. Beyond what I talked about before in terms of remarkability of products and so on, I think we’re also starting to build some better awareness. I think, Jack and I have talked on this call before about if there was one thing to really go after is to making sure that larger sellers think of us not just as the place you go to, to start accepting payments, because they would accept digital electronic payments, but to make sure they know of Square as the place you can go to when you have multiple locations, when you have multiple employees and when you have a much more complex business. So, I think that that is definitely improving, although I still think we have a lot of work to do there and that it’s definitely true when you go outside of the United States, making sure that in our newer countries that we are known for all of that too. I think the UK is a good case and point where we launched with the really fully featured product set. So, not just kind of offline beautiful elegant hardware, great easy to use software but we also launched with our full API platform, so, really letting sellers know that they can be both online and offline with Square. And I think the UK is a good example of a market where the awareness on the online piece is much higher and we can kind of see that in the split between card present, so kind of offline and card not present online business. So, a good example of when we start from there, we can build the brand of being a much broader offering for a customer of any scale. Okay. As a quick follow-up, any change in customer behavior given the market volatility? And do you expect any changes in loan fees, based on any interest rate movements? Thanks. So, in terms of customer behavior, I’m not quite sure exactly what you meant by market volatility. But we just see real strength in the base. So, fact that we’re growing 51% year-over-year underscores both the strength of our product set, the fact that I think we are taking share, but also the fact that our customer’s business is quite strong at the moment. I think the NFIB index is something I look at fairly frequently and it continues to show strength on a period-to-period basis.
In terms of interest rates rising, coming back to Square Capital, it’s such a unique product. I think, what we got into there was recognizing the small businesses just do not have access to capital. But, when we survey them, what they would have fallen back to would have probably been friends and family or frankly just not getting the money. The fact that we can now offer them the loan that’s a scale that feels right for their business is incredibly -- it helps build trust for them. And when they get that loan, they’re doing what you’d expect. They’re buying inventory, they’re hiring new employees, they may be taking any lease hold and opening that second location. And when they do that, their business grows and hence our business grows. So, we still think we have a unique product that no one else can really follow us into. We continue to watch interest rates, but we like the pricing that we have in the product right now. And we think customers continue to really benefit from it. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking the question this afternoon. It’s around the Square Cash Card and the ability with or without bank ownership perhaps and partnership with the bank to offer more enterprise type solutions using that product. I know there are some other players in the market that are doing just that. Is that a potential extension of that card -- card’s functionality? When you say more enterprise, like what do you mean by that? Well, for example, there is a company that is permitting Uber drivers to deposit their fares directly into an account, that type of thing which would create a ready ability to spend, which conceivably could be done in partnership with a bank rather than by virtue of owning a bank. I didn’t know if there were extensions to the product beyond its current functionality you might be thinking about. Yes, definitely. So, we’re definitely looking as a financial service to make it easier for individuals to see us as a primary spending device. And we do have evidence to show that people are using it as their primary account. We have launched a suite of features, such that you can download the app and you have a place to store your money, you get a Visa card that can be used online or offline, that card can also be used at any ATM. You get a routing number to actually deposit your paycheck too, directly. And we continue to look for ways to make that even more valuable. One of the things that we added just yesterday was a rewards program, built right into the card. So, you can choose a particular merchant or a category of merchants such as coffee or hamburgers, and every time you use the cash card at one of those categories or one of those merchants, you get a discount whether it would be $1 off or 15% off. And we haven’t seen this done for a debit card anywhere before. So, giving things that you would normally associate with a more premium card to everyone is exactly what we want to do.
In terms of spreading that out elsewhere beyond consumers, one of the things that we benefit from is all the infrastructure that makes the Cash App work and Cash Card work. The rest of the Company benefits from as well. So for instance, Instant Deposit, which we have ship to our sellers is a lot of the infrastructure that cash developed internally. And so as we continue to develop these products, we see opportunities for our other services. Even if it’s individual product, we see benefits to enable sellers to utilize this is as well. And we will continue to look for those opportunities where we continue to blur the line between an individual and the seller and what infrastructure can we take from the Cash App that we can actually apply to our seller customer base as well. And you’ll continue to see developments as we go through the year on that. This will be the last question. Paul Condra of Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the transaction cost because it was down, it was really positive in the quarter. So, I wondered if there was anything specific to the quarter or how should we think about it, staying at that rate? Sure. Thanks, Paul. So, yes, we were really pleased with where transactions came out. Transaction profit margin at 1.09% was actually up from 1.07% in Q1 of a year ago. What’s driving that? As we’ve talked about before, overall, just the take rates as you all love to call it, does end up being a balance between places where we perhaps want to be more aggressive, so with larger sellers often -- or not often, but sometimes will offer a custom price. If you don’t hit our website just naturally onboard but you do engage with sales, it’s a place we might custom price. But going against that is the inflationary effect of higher revenue products like invoices, virtual terminal, e-commerce APIs, all of which have been really improving in the quarter. So, that’s one driver of why transaction profit margins are up.
And then the second piece is the cost profile itself. So, recall that as we get to scale. And I think what we’re proving to a lot of our supply chains is that we are bringing a lot net new onto the system. So, whether it’s small businesses, who maybe previously didn’t want to take cards and we know that there is still a lot of cash only businesses out there. We are able to bring them onto the system. We see it in places like the UK where folks have struggled because bank branches have been closed. And now, we can bring them up with electronic payments to never miss that sale. But that’s a really good story out to the partners that we work with and the reason why they continue to work with us as we negotiate the cost of side of the equitation. And it’s a great place where we can stand in front of our sellers to negotiate the best rates for them. So, net-net, we are pleased with our profit margins and about for the quarter and we will continue to do all that we can whether it’s from a technology standpoint, how we negotiate standpoint or just new products that we can bring to bear to continue to drive that to a better and better place. Just on the focus more on larger sellers and I’m thinking about how you categorize the sort of the complex seller group with multiple locations. How are you thinking about sales and customer service and different kinds of needs of those sellers relative to the more self serve model that you use for some of the smaller sellers. Yes. So, I do think that this is a place for the industry loves to talk about the need for lots of people to engage. And the reality is that customer support you will ever have is the one that no one ever needs to call. So, I do love the fact that over 80% of our sellers self onboard, get up, get running, get going on Square and actually never need to talk to us.
With that said, we understand that for folks who might have multiple locations, they do want to talk to our sales person as they onboard to get confidence. And we absolutely have built an organization to do that. But we do constantly do it hand in glove with some technology. So, a good example would be when you self identify on our website as a larger seller, overnight we score all of those inbounds, we use machine learning in place there to make sure that the folks that -- our sales forces reaching back out to have a really high propensity to convert and that we are confident that they will bring with them the margin that we want for our business overall, but keep Square able to keep reinvesting. If you don’t fall back into our call back, we are absolutely happy to put back into a flow that feels very pertinent to your business. So, we speak to you as a hair salon or we speak to you as a retail store. And so that’s the ways that we use technology to be able to make people feel really comfortable, whether they’re talking to a person or whether they’re just going through the technology piece.
I think from an account management perspective, our customer success standpoint, I could make all of the same sort of comments. But, our goal is how do we build the most efficient, scalable company over time that has people in the places where we need people to talk to our sellers but more and more where we can utilize technology to make that feel really effortless. And I think, it’s something that a lot of the rest of the industry is trying to catch up on. I’m not sure if they ever will catch up on, just given the length that they come up this with. I’d now like to turn the call back over to the Company for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone for joining our call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings call. We have Jack and Sarah with us today. First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're really proud of our work this quarter. Weighted more offerings for our restaurants, and customers are spending more with Cash Card. Additionally, the breadth and depth of our ecosystem is enabling product integrations that are unique to Square. We're excited about the launch of Square for Restaurants, our newest industry-specific point-of-sale and our first for larger full-service restaurants. With this product, restaurants can more easily manage operations so that service can spend more time delighting diners. This ease-of-use also extends the setup. While other points-of-sale requires a salesperson onboard, more than 60% of Square for Restaurants sellers have self-onboarded.
We're also making it easier for restaurants to manage online and in-person orders by working to integrate Caviar with Square for Restaurants. This integration will be unique to Square because we're the only company that provides both the point-of-sale and through delivery and pickup. Caviar is growing rapidly. The revenue in the second quarter of 2018 more than doubled year-over-year. The Caviar restaurants offer diners more ways to order, on their computer or phone, for pickup or delivery and for individuals or groups, including corporate catering. And diners come to Caviar for food that they can't get anywhere else. More than 25% of food order volume is from restaurants that are exclusive to Caviar. This full offering of delivery, pickup and corporate catering has helped us win in San Francisco, where Caviar is a top food ordering platform.
Finally, we continue to expand Cash App to provide more financial services that customers rely on daily. We recently launched Cash Boost, a Cash Card rewards program that gives customers instant discounts when they go to merchants like Shake Shack. Overall, Cash Card drives engagement. Customers spent $250 million in June. This spend has nearly tripled since December and represents $3 billion on an annualized basis.
Additionally, we've integrated Cash App with Caviar, which allows couriers to automatically get paid after they complete a delivery. We think paying couriers instantly for their work is the right thing to do, and our ecosystem makes that possible. All these new services are the results of our focus on the long term. We're listening to our customers, building, listening some more and always improving. We'll continue to take the long view and push ourselves to deliver remarkable products to our customers.
Now I'll turn it over to Sarah for some more detailed remarks on our financials. Thank you, Jack. This is a strong quarter for the company. Total net revenue was $815 million, up 48% year-over-year compared to 45% in Q1. Adjusted revenue was $385 million, up 60% year-over-year compared to 51% in Q1. This represents our fifth quarter of accelerating revenue growth, even when excluding the impact from acquisitions in the quarter. Transaction-based profit for the products we monetize through payments was $230 million, up 34% year-over-year. Half of our GPV came from larger sellers, which are those that generate over $125,000 in annualized GPV. This is up from 46% in the second quarter of 2017 and highlights how our cohesive ecosystem is resonating with sellers of all sizes.
We saw strong momentum in subscription and services adjusted revenue growth, which accelerated to 131% year-over-year, driven primarily by Instant Deposit, Caviar, Cash Card and Square Capital and also included the impact of the acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly. Excluding acquisitions, growth also accelerated. Speed continues to differentiate Square to our sellers across all our products. For example, Instant Deposit volume was $4 billion in the second quarter. Hardware revenue was $18 million in the quarter, up 78% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in Square Register as well as Square Stand and Square Reader for contactless and chip.
GAAP net loss in the second quarter was $6 million compared to a net loss of $16 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net loss per share basic and diluted was $0.01 for the second quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss per share of $0.04 in the second quarter of '17. Adjusted EBITDA was $68 million, representing a margin of 18%, up three points from Q2 of 2017, underscoring that we are driving operating leverage even as we continue to reinvest in the business.
Looking ahead, given the ongoing momentum, we are increasing our top line guidance for the full year. For 2018, we now expect total net revenue to be within a range of $3.19 billion to $3.22 billion and adjusted revenue to be in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.54 billion. At the midpoint, this represents 55% year-over-year growth, up from 49% in our prior guidance. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $240 million to $250 million as we continue to reinvest to drive future growth. Our 2018 priorities of omnichannel, financial services and international will guide our reinvestment spend for the remainder of the year. We believe these areas will provide meaningful value to our sellers and consumers, not to mention substantially increase our total addressable market.
Our growth acceleration in recent periods is a result of investments we've made over the past few years. Our success with Cash App is a great example, where we're building an ecosystem of financial services for individuals in the same way that we did for businesses.
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. I'll start by asking on the outlook. Because second quarter, pretty impressed with the 18% EBITDA margin. You accelerated revenue again. You raised revenue, like you said, Sarah, but kept EBITDA unchanged. So sounds like you're reinvesting more aggressively. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on where you're putting those incremental dollars to work? Could we see more in places like Boost, for example, or maybe Square Register? Thanks, Tien-tsin. So I think you're nailing it in terms of what we're trying to balance right now. So as ever, we want to lean into growth. We see a lot of untapped opportunities ahead of us, but we want to make sure we're doing that with financial discipline. So as you saw in Q2, we hit 60% top line growth, which I'm kind of personally wowed by, but we did that while still showing three points of EBITDA margin improvement. And so if you look at what the back half second half guide implies, it's also three points of margin improvement, and we think that's the right balance of really doubling down on our investment but making sure that we're doing it while staying mindful of operating leverage in the business. Where we'll invest, so the three areas. Omnichannel, clearly, we made a bigger move with the acquisition of Weebly last quarter, and so there's work to do there as we continue to integrate. On the financial services side, really happy with how Cash App generally is progressing, consistently a top 30 app in the App Store. I think it was as high as 15 or 14 earlier when I looked. You asked about Boost specifically. That is one area of investment because it's all about how do we drive daily utility on Cash App. And then finally, in international, it's a combination of both building out remarkable products. I'm sure you'll ask us more on this in the call. But once we have a remarkable product, we want to keep driving awareness. So a good example is the lean-in we've done on go-to market in the U.K., and we'll continue to do more of that as we get into the back half of the year. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to Tien-tsin's question. Just as we think ahead about margins. I mean, this trade-off totally makes sense. And obviously, you guys are doing a fantastic job on the top line. But just so people's expectations are properly calibrated, I think on a full year basis, we're now looking at about 200 bps of margin expansion year-over-year in '18. When you think longer term, I know you had put some future data targets out there in the past. Do we still get to those targets? Does it just take longer? And even as we start to have early thoughts around '19, is 200 to 300 basis points a year kind of the right cadence just because you have so much TAM to go after that you're not going to let too much flow through to the bottom line? So thanks, Jason. And we're not ready to give full-on guidance for FY '19 or beyond. But if I kind of start with the premise, I think, beneath your question, nothing has changed in terms of our long-term margin potential. So we've talked about having a long-term of margin goal 35% to 40%. If you look at the two major ways we monetize, whether it's through our payments business model or through subscription services, in both cases, as we showed at Investor Day, we can get over 50% incremental margins on those businesses. And so right now, with the ability to both continue to invest in product, so I think Cash App is a great example, as I said in my prepared remarks, of investing today for businesses that can be really material to the top and bottom line over the next 2 to 3 years, we want to keep doing that investment. So that is hiring great engineers, great data scientists, great designers and product managers. But even beyond that, if you think about sales and marketing, what we're seeing in there is we still see a 3 to 4 quarter payback period, and we have a positive dollar base retention.
So within $1 and today to bring on a new customer to the Square ecosystem pays for itself within a year and then actually grows. Last time what we gave you is about 113% year-over-year, and again, that's been fairly consistent. So everything we look at says keep investing. The more we grow the ecosystem, the more we brings Square sellers onto the platform and now consumers onto the platform, the more opportunity we have down the line to continue to cross-sell and upsell into that base. So we think that is the right stance to take. So again, it's a balance, and that's why I'm really happy to see 60% type growth this quarter but still doing it with three points of margin expansion and the guidance still allowing for three points of margin expansion in the back half of the year. So just a quick follow-up on Instant Deposit volume because that was a real big number at $4 billion. Can you give us a sense where the mix sits between the merchant side and the consumer side there? And what kind of EBITDA flow through do you generally get off that volume? Sure. So Instant Deposit speaks to, first of all, that our sellers appreciate speed in all we do, whether it's soft hardware to accept the payment type or fast access to their phones. And we revolutionize that from day one at Square by giving them next-day settlement, and then we sped it up by giving them Instant Deposit. That $4 billion that we noted in Q2, the best comp for that is we gave about a $2 billion number in Q3 of last year. So a little under a year of actually double the Instant Deposit volume. It is a mix of both sellers and Cash App being monetized with both value of the speed point. We don't -- we're not at a point where we want to break that apart, but it is an important monetization for both. And then in terms of EBITDA flow through, as you can imagine, and a lot of these products like in Instant Deposit, where we've already acquired the customer, there's not a lot of incremental costs when we add on a new product like this, and that is the beauty of the ecosystem. It's once we have a customer in place, we know that the more they use a second product or a third product from Square, the more sticky they are, and it is less expensive for us typically to be able to both upsell that product but then be able to support that product over the long run. And I think we gave a nice data point last quarter that of our largest sellers, more than 50% of them take a second product from Square. We will now take a call from a Square seller. My name is Sarah Swingber [ph]. My company is Dream in Color Jewelry [ph]. We have one of our bigger sales opportunities coming up actually -- or during next weekend with Shake Woods Festival, and we've been notified that the WiFi at the festival is pretty unpredictable, but we use Square quite a bit with our tiny little company. So I'm just kind of curious as to how secure the Square off-line payment system is. Thanks, Sarah. Thank you for being a Square seller as well. We put a lot of thought and investment into security around the board but especially to make sure that all of our sellers can continue to make sales even in rough network or unpredictable network environments. So we do focus a lot of our attention. So you can trust that's going to work, and everything will remain secure as you use it, even in unpredictable network environments. Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. I was wondering if you can maybe comment a little bit on your vertical-specific software solutions. You have obviously launched restaurants, but before that, you had retail. Can you maybe talk about how the retail ramp has gone? Maybe how penetrated you are with those vertical-specific solutions? What your ambitions for where those eventually go are? And then I guess, more to the point, what the end goals in terms of how many restaurants, I mean, total restaurant population do you expect, for example, would be penetrated with that solution? Thanks, Jim. So we -- the way -- when we first started the company, we approached this from more of a horizontal approach, so building the system network for every type of business. We made the decision to focus on three specific verticals, retail, restaurants and services, and build against them. We launched retail not so long ago, restaurants more recently and have -- had services for quite some time. We are also approaching verticals in more of a horizontal way as well, so that we are recognizing what are the fundamentals for each one of the verticals, making them super easy, simple, really focusing on the operations of the seller and looking for opportunities to integrate the rest of our ecosystem more broadly.
Restaurants is a great example where we can -- we believe we can help a lot of restaurants, especially help them make more sales, who might be constrained by the number of tables they have in their physical space or how quickly they can turn them over, with an integration of Caviar. So suddenly, that point-of-sale will be able to -- that will enable food delivery and also pickup. So we think there's a lot of potential around that. The other interesting point, data point, that I had mentioned in my opening remarks is that over 60% of Square for Restaurants sellers have self-onboarded, and this is rather unusual in the industry. Typically, restaurants go to the point-of-sale provider, and they need help to set everything up. That includes their table map, all the menus, basically all the operations that they need to focus on to run their restaurant. They actually need a third-party to help them out. So the ability for a restaurant to take that on and self-onboard and do all their menus, do all their table layout with our software is pretty awesome because it creates efficiencies. And the other great thing is that our restaurant seller average annualized GPV is over 650,000. So these are not small. So no matter if you're a smaller wholesale restaurant or a quick-serve restaurant or a larger one, you have something that's easy to use, and you can continue to push into focusing on your customers and your diners. So that's the intention. We are constantly learning from what our sellers are doing in each of the three verticals and looking for ways to make their lives easier, and that really reflects how we think about our road map. And the faster we can move, the faster adoption we see. Yes, that's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe comment on Square Capital? Still very, very good number there, but growth has slowed to kind of the low 20s at this point. So can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives you're undertaking to expand the number of addressable sellers who want to take that product? And I guess, where do you think that penetration rate could go over time? Or do you think you've kind of taken that about as far as you want so that's going to be more of an in-line growth from here? Sure. So Jim, on capital overall, I mean, a good quarter, $390 million of originations, 60,000 loans. What I'm really impressed by is that this quarter, they crossed the $3 billion threshold of loans facilitated to date. That's 500,000 loans and advances made. So we're really tapping into an unmet need that we see out there broadly in Squarespace but beyond Squarespace. So think about $80 billion of unmet small business demand for loans, so I think it's an amazing product. And it will continue to grow as our base grows. But in terms of new initiatives, there's a couple of strong irons in the fire right now. Partnerships is an area that we have been working on for multiple years. We have learned as we have gone in terms of finding partners that have sellers that look similar to Square sellers where we can utilize the knowledge we have garnered over the last several years with both onboarding them, making sure it's presented in the way that they want to see it but then also being able to manage the risk.
And I think the most recent partner we announced just as recently as last week is eBay, which is a great example of finding a partner where their sellers look like Square sellers. So that's one area where we continue to expand the front door. And in fact, we bring net new sellers and through capital. And then over time, just as we do with other products where we see net new, we can obviously begin to cross-sell and upsell as appropriate. The second area on capital that we continue to iterate on is installments. So recall, that is effectively where we place ourselves at that interesting nexus between the buyer and the seller. We have oriented to be a seller product, so we know that small businesses traditionally don't have access to installment program. So it's a tool that larger businesses use to help them grow, and we want to make sure it's now an offer to smaller businesses. What we're able to use there is the knowledge of both the business itself but also the consumer. And so we're starting to learn about consumer information that we might see more broadly on Square's network, and from that, just continue to test and iterate. And I think what we see, so far, gets us excited because the sellers who are utilizing Square Installments are absolutely seeing their business grow. So most important thing, when they grow, because then we'll grow. And your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. I had a question on Square for Restaurants and in particular the full service restaurants. So my question is kind of a little more of the competitive dynamic and where the winds are coming from. So we've been hearing that Micros in the hands of Oracle is really not being supported like through the dealership network that it has historically had. And so my question is, are you winning a lot of this business actual share gains? Were you ripping or replacing existing shipments? Or are you riding a wave of incremental new restaurants that are opening up in specific geographies where you obviously have strong hand? I believe it's a little bit of both, and that's been consistent with our general growth across our entire seller base. We do have a unique advantage, though, given the deep relationships we have with our sellers and how seller-focused we are, especially on the restaurant side. Even if folks have not tried the Square for Restaurants brand, they are aware of the Caviar brand and how much focus -- how much partnership focus there is there. So there is a lot of attention and awareness already going in. And for a restaurant to come in through the restaurant's point-of-sale and get access to the full ecosystem inclusive of Square Capital and Payroll and our customer directory and invoices and everything that would make their business operations a little bit easier and more efficient, there's a lot of pull. So we definitely see switches. We definitely see switchers, but we're also seeing net new and a lot of new restaurants coming up as well. That's great. Can I just ask a quick follow-up on Cash Boost? It wasn't clear to me. Are you guys actually funding the rewards? Or is that a merchant-funded reward program and you're acting as kind of the conduit in order to facilitate it to the consumer? Yes. Thanks. One of the things that's been really effective for us with Cash and a lot of our products is this mindset of experimentation. So Cash Boost started out as really just a question. We saw an opportunity where the audience that we were serving, the customers that we were serving didn't typically have access to a rewards program on any of their cards if they had a card in the first place. So for us, first and foremost, to be able to issue them a card, that's Visa brand that works anywhere Visa is accepted, that works at any ATM that they can fund directly through a direct deposit with their paycheck, and put a rewards program there was interesting. The second thing that we took into consideration is where they're spending their money. We want to make sure that we were delivering a solution that was consistent with our usage and what they wanted to do. And then finally, we want to make sure that we have a lot of optionality moving forward. So to get to your question, we want to make sure that we are experimenting with a variety of models, and then we'll ultimately determine which one is best. But first and foremost, we want to make sure that we're giving people a support for where they're spending Cash Card and, obviously, using it in a daily way because it is their financial instrument to pay for things, and then make the appropriate moves to make sure that we can scale it and actually turn into a big part of our business. So we're super excited about it. It's early, but we're seeing a lot of resonance that gets us pretty excited about its future. Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Nice job on the growth. Just -- I just have a question on the Cash App again. I mean, first of all, I'm not sure if you've updated the 7 million or 8 million users that you had disclosed by the end of the year number. And then just when considering the monetization of that -- I mean, Jack, there's clearly Instant Deposit debit card. How far along are these? And maybe just have you thought of what other opportunities there are to monetize this longer term? Yes. We're not going to be updating the monthly number. We wanted to focus everyone on the card itself. We've been really impressed with the growth, and it is showing more evidence that people are using this as a primary, if not only, spending device. So we try to be really thoughtful in terms of how people might use this on a daily basis, and adding the ability to store money with us, adding the ability to give a virtual ABA number that anyone can direct deposit to paycheck into, that the card be an ATM card as well so you could actually go to an ATM and take money out of it. Those are all reasons that reinforce one another that we are seeing evidence that this is a primary account for them, and that gets us excited because these are folks who are not on the financial system before and certainly not transacting in any meaningful way. So we do think the card is pretty far along, but we see a lot of opportunity for innovation there, and we're pretty excited about what's to come on it. And then in terms of monetization, yes. I mean, there's certainly multiple pass to monetize cash. I think we've shown a number of them, and they're all extremely healthy and, more importantly, reinforce the usage. And our incentives are aligned with who we're serving and our customers. So it's not a tax on their usage, which is great. So in terms of how we look at new features, we're really looking at the broader ecosystem of how people use financial devices and look for opportunities to take some friction out or to expand who we might be able to serve. And particularly interesting is the underserved and the unbanked. We're definitely reaching that audience, and that's consistent with the broader Square reach as well. Starting nine years ago, we reached an underserved and underbanked seller and happy to do it again with consumers this time. Your next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc. I wanted to ask about omnichannel. You called that out as number one investment priority for this year. And I know you've only had Weebly for a couple of months in your hands. But as we think about the integration moving forward, is that something that's going to be embedded into the Square for the sale app? Is it a distinct kind of bolt-on offering like you've done with Square for Restaurants? Just how should we be thinking about the rollout of that product? Just to back up, I mean, a lot of people, when they hear the word omnichannel, they immediately rush to e-commerce and online. And the way we've been thinking about it is there's all these new channels of potential sales emerging, and what it really represents tangibly is meeting your customers where they are. We've always had a principle of making sure that our sellers can always make the sale no matter if the payment is coming across a physical counter or digitally. So we think much more broadly about omnichannel and all the channels one could sell through. Caviar is a good example of this. We would think about invoices and virtual terminal are other great examples of this partnership with Eventbrite, another such example. In terms of the online space in particular and Weebly, it's been 60 days. We've reconfirmed and reaffirmed the reasons why we felt the companies would be so great together. The team has been amazing. The customer base is really excellent, presents a bunch of opportunity, especially as we think about going outside our five markets. We're thinking through the branding and how to best place it. The thing that I think we have done really well is maintain a sense of cohesion in that, that their simplicity, you don't feel the seams across the various services and the products. So we want the same intention as we think about Weebly and e-commerce, so that our sellers should not have to think about selling online. They should just have to think about what they're selling and, ultimately, who they're selling to, and we can handle -- making sure that they can sell across multiple channels in a very simple and easy way. So we still have a lot to learn in terms of how the integration will complete from a customer-facing standpoint, but we're pretty excited to start rolling some of those things in. And just as a follow-up. So obviously, Weebly does have a very international footprint. There's -- so you have new assets. There certainly have been some competitive developments internationally. So when you just kind of take a step back and think about the international opportunity as well as the outperformance you've had in the business, does it make you want to accelerate your path to move further into those existing international markets or push into others? Are you thinking about that any differently? Sure. From an international standpoint, I mean, the current market is we're in, remember, quite massive. $6 trillion in gross receipts across the four markets, excluding the United States. And so I think this year, it was a really good focus for us to go back into the market beyond the U.S., so Canada, Japan, Australia, U.K., and really think about what next to make the product remarkable. We've talked a little bit about the U.K. to date, but what we're seeing there is there is work to do just to -- not just to upsell or not just to bring folks who are already on the system up and onto a more modern platform, but more importantly, to go back out into the 50% of micro and small merchants who don't accept cards today. And that's where market development work needs to get done, and it's kind of surprising to us in a way that it's hasn't been done to date, but helping explain to them that they are missing sales when they don't accept cards. I think 1 in 6 folks in the U.K. don't carry cash and that when people do use cards, they typically spend more, and so there's a really good story there.
We've seen it. We've done town takeovers, in fact, in the U.K., most recently a town called Darwen in Lancashire, where 95% of merchants were cash-only. And we're expecting to get the same result we got in Holywell, where we get them to about 95% accepting cards. So a ton of work to do there. What Weebly is giving us, to kind of segue from what Jack was talking about, is 40% of their revenue is outside of the United States. And of that 40%, more like half is in the market -- the other markets we're in. So it is allowing us a way to test other markets for Square's products, broadly speaking, with a resonance. And so it's always a balance of continuing to really put a lot of investment behind a market that's still young where we have a lot of room to grow versus going a little thinner and going broader. And I think as we go into 2019 planning, we always go back to make the right trade-off there. And remember, it's not just about our seller platform anymore. Cash launched in the U.K. last quarter, and so now we're starting to see what it's like to go more international with the consumer product and does the pace of movement internationally change when we look at something that is a purely software-driven online product without having a hardware component associated with it. Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. I just had a follow-up to Jason's question related to Instant Deposit. I guess, two parts. First, can you just give a little bit of color around the usage pattern for Instant Deposit, meaning like what type of adoption level are you seeing across the base, the frequency of the transactions, average transaction sizes? Any kind of color there. And then I guess the second question is just how you're seeing that business impacted by things like the rollout of same-time -- same-day settlement for ACH in the U.S. and the rollout of competitive offerings by some of your P2P competitors like PayPal and Venmo? Sure. Thanks, Lisa, and welcome to the call. From an Instant Deposit standpoint, it comes back to this concept of speed. Speed really matters to our customers, whether it's the fact that our contactless and chip reader is getting down into seconds to take the transaction, whether it was next-day settlement and then Instant Deposit. We know it really matters to small businesses to have fast access to working capital. When they have fast access, they can keep reinvesting in their business and make their business grow. And so in terms of usage patterns, on the seller side, it's a lot of what we thought as we launched. But particularly sellers that had big-weekend businesses like hair salons or bars and restaurants, they often wouldn't get paid out in a traditional world until maybe the Tuesday, and they were having to float paying their staff, paying their suppliers without seeing their payments come through the door. And so we're able to smooth a lot of that out, and that continues in terms of usage.
And then similarly on the consumer side, we've seen tremendous uptick from a cash-out perspective of people who want to get fast access to funds. Now clearly, we're balancing that by creating a balance and starting to give you real utility on keeping your money in the Cash App and then from that being to use all the pieces that Jack spoke to, the card virtually, the card offline, et cetera, et cetera. In terms of competitive offerings, they're really just speed generally. A point, I think, we've talked about before. I mean, moving money quickly in and of itself isn't the difficult thing. It's hard to do, but we've done it. But risk is really where the rubber hits the road, and you really have to be doing real-time automated risk management if you're going to get into the business of instantly depositing out to sellers and to individuals. And we were born in that era, so our risk from the get-go was built with at the time we set off for algorithms, today what people would call machine learning, getting into deep learning. I think we've given a stat before that 99.95% of all of our transactions are automated. They never fall to a human being to look at, and we continue to grind away in how do we take that number higher. And so we think that's really the differentiation between us and a lot of our competitive bench, is this -- the ability to do risk in that hyper automated fashion. Terrific. And then just my follow-up on the core business, which has now been growing fairly consistently TPV growth in the 30% range with pretty stable transaction-based profit percentages. Can you give a sense, though, as you look out, how you're seeing the trajectory of that business? Meaning, do you see a path toward accelerating the volumes there or potentially expanding the profit percentages as you're adding more software content into the offerings like with the vertical-specific solutions? So yes, I wouldn't label it core and, I guess, noncore. The way we think about the breakdown on our P&L is what is the monetization method that we're utilizing, so it's not a product-based P&L. So we have optionality, and we use that optionality to be as aggressive as possible when we go to market. So for example, if you take a software product like invoices, massive utility to sellers. That's a good example where, unlike our competition, we don't charge a software fee. Instead, we monetize it all through payment. So it would fall under that transaction-based profit line. Equally, there are places where we can get a lot more aggressive from a payments standpoint because we are going to charge a monthly fee. And a good example would be, say, something like Square for Retail, where we charge 2.5 and $0.10, but we charge a $60 per device fee and then $20 thereafter. So it's really about how do we balance the best outcome of price as a feature of the product. So we don't build a remarkable product then price it, rather price is part of how we build it to begin with. In terms of what accelerates the overall business, it's effectively what we've talked about before, the ability to continue to move upmarket into larger sellers, so 50% of our GPV now coming from larger sellers. It's the ability to flip and take their full book of business. So if they started online but now want to move off-line, if they started off-line but want to be able to use [indiscernible] payments, we want to take their full book of business. And then the third factor is international. Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. I wanted to ask about Caviar. I'm impressed by the growth of that business. So just trying to figure out what's driving that top line. Are you guys taking share from other providers? Or is it just organically growing as people outsource more their delivery and options for that business? And then secondly, just on the EBITDA margins of Caviar, what do they look like today? And what do they look like when they get to scale? Yes. So we think what's driving the growth is -- and what -- and equally, what sets Caviar apart from everyone else is, number one, the deep relationship with our restaurants. So we do spend a lot of time obsessing over their operations and continuing to look for ways to make them a lot more efficient, and there's not a lot of our peers who really focus on those elements. It's more of a buyer-focused, a diner-focused approach. And the reason this is meaningful is because, ultimately, if you do want to drive more sales to a Caviar -- to a restaurant, you need to make sure that it fits in with your standard operations as well, people actually coming into your door. And we found a really good mix and a balance. So we certainly see a drive from the sellers themselves and the restaurants themselves to encourage our customers to look at the Caviar platform and download the app, which is awesome. We have a very friendly, very easy, super accessible brand.
We've put a lot of focus on the customer experience as well right down to the courier. And so starting with the -- easing the operations of a restaurant all the way to when the food is handed off to a customer, we've really focused on making sure that, that feels effortless, it feels easy, and it feels really simple. I think the other thing that we benefit from is the fact that we are part of Square and we have a much broader ecosystem that we can show these restaurants to. Whether they're just doing pickup or they're doing delivery, we can show them everything else that we have to offer, inclusive of things like Square Payroll and Square Capital, our Square for Restaurants point-of-sale, our customer directory. So we do have a much broader offering that people don't have to put together all the pieces around, and we are seeing really strong momentum. And it's really important that we keep this momentum up. Pragmatic approaches won't help, so we have to be really nimble as we think about how to extend our road map and really serve both sellers and their customers in the right way. And I'll let Sarah take the question on EBITDA margins. Sure. Thanks, Jack. So just from an EBITDA margin perspective, Bryan, holistically, we really think about the business more holistically. We want to make sure we're in a good business, and we believe Caviar is a very good business, both from a top line growth perspective, but also from a unit economic perspective. And it continues to get better as we get scale. And frankly, as we get better and better on efficiency, the team is a good place, as an example, where we do use machine learning. So think about how do we up the number of deliveries a courier can make in a given period of time is one of the main drivers of the gross margin in the business. So net-net, when I think of it holistically, we're trying to balance off, as Jack has pointed out, a businesslike Caviar and how it can insert into the point-of-sale, and with that, drive more point-of-sale and make us really unique and differentiated from anyone else in the market, and then against that, continue to balance the overall uplift and overall EBITDA margins at a company level back to that point I made about Q2 being three point of improvement year-over-year and the back half of the year being a three-point improvement year-over-year. Your next question comes from Paul Condra with Crédit Suisse. I also had a question on Caviar just as it's done very well. And when you think about replicating that ecosystem in other cities, I wonder if you can talk about what strategy looks like. Is that something that might be, will you look to do M&A? Or could you expand it more organically in other cities? Yes. I mean, with Caviar, we have been pretty aggressive with M&A in terms of expansion. So we've shown a number of acquisitions that help us either open or strengthen our current markets, so that is certainly a potential. We -- one of the reasons we launched pickup is because we could see many more markets faster, and that gives us an opportunity to learn about those restaurants much faster and then work out all the logistics that we would need for a delivery held as well. So we made a conscious choice some time ago to not make Caviar about delivery but really make it about food, and we want to be in the first consideration whenever you're hungry and you don't want to make something at home. And that meant that we had to really look deeply at various ways that food can come to you. So delivery is where we started, and pickup is the next iteration. Of course, there are opportunities within dine-in as well, and that's where moves like Square for Restaurants really fits in and continues to strengthen the ecosystem. But we do believe that our approach is, number one, optimized for learning so that we can learn where to make the next move in terms of what we need to do in delivery operations. And number two, really paying attention to the market and telling behaviors and making sure that we fit the solution in the right way. But ultimately, we want Caviar to be everywhere and as an ultimate food destination and again in that first considerations that whenever someone is hungry. Great. And I guess, just a follow-up to switch gears to the bank application. If you could update us on the status with the FDIC and then whether this OCC national charter might make sense for Square. I know it was just announced so you haven't maybe had a lot of time to look through it. But is that kind of a possible route for you? Yes. So we have an ongoing dialogue with the FDIC in Utah. We decided to withdraw and refile, which allows us to amend and strengthen some areas of our application with the FDIC. In terms of the OCC fintech charter, we're pretty encouraged about the continued conversations between regulators and companies like ours, and we continue to believe that we're really well positioned to broaden access to the financial system, which is our core purpose. Your last question will come from Rayna Kumar with Evercore ISI. What has been your progress with Square Register and retail POS? How far upmarket have you been able to go with these products? And just how has your initial traction been with Square for Restaurants? Sure. So in terms of Square Register progress that we -- I think Jack already spoke to it in terms of what it brings to sellers. We recognize with Square Register that larger sellers, and actually sellers of all sizes are what we're seeing right now, want to continue to have a better and better experience sitting right there on their countertop. And what they loved is the customer display. We hear that over and over again. And I think it's a good example of when we build a product, we wanted to highlight our seller. It's not about Square. It's actually about their business. They had also love the connection they get with digital receipts, the engagement with loyalty. I was actually looking at our digital receipts number. We have sent per 497 million digital receipts just in the trailing 12 months, which really speaks to how much we draw together the seller with their buyer.
In terms of the fit, Square Register does bring on slightly larger sellers, so we see an average GPV of about $300,000. As of Q1, haven't really updated it, but hasn't changed massively. About 1/3 of those orders are coming from new to Square sellers, and we'd expect that to continue to grow over time because the base will ultimately fully upgrade. And then from there, it's really about a new doorway into Square. And as expected, it really does work well in food, services and retail, our major verticals. So Square Register is doing quite nicely and continuing to just underscore Square's strengths from a hardware perspective. In terms of how far we can go, today, I don't really see a limit in terms of how far we go in general across our seller base. Clearly, when you get into really large merchants, they often have a need for more of an API integration. They may not want [indiscernible] Square because they may already have a lot of systems in place, and that's exactly where the Build with Square or the API platform comes into its own. And I think that's allowing us to really penetrate larger and larger sellers.
And then I think you asked about restaurant's progress as well. Still very young in market. We gave you a little bit of color in the shareholder letter. So I think the good of it is, it's a huge market, so 300,000 restaurants in the U.S. alone, $300 billion in gross receipts. When you get outside the U.S., it's about double that. So clearly, tons of opportunity. I think the good is we are seeing it as a push into larger sellers as we expected, so the average GPV of a restaurant customer is $650,000. And I think Jack already alluded to, we've seen nice kind of integration of other products there, too, that if someone comes on, on Square for Restaurants, they'd be a very natural fit for things like payroll, a very natural fit for things like loyalty. And so those are kind of the ways we can lean in to make sure we're selling the whole ecosystem of Square. I would now like to turn the call over to the company for closing remarks.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings call. We have Jack and Sarah with us today. First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations Web site, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.

We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations Web site. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations Web site. An audio replay of this call will be available on our Web site shortly.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. Good afternoon everyone. We're going to try something a little bit different here. Instead of reading you prepared remarks to start the call and the conservation, Sarah and I are going to go through a list of the highlights that we've seen throughout the quarter that we wanted to bring to your attention.
So I wanted to start with why we are here as a company, our purpose is to empower people into the economy, enable them to participate in a way that they haven't been able to in the past; the way we do this is by focusing most of our efforts on helping sellers make a sale, and ideally helping them make more sales. One of the things that we've done extremely well is increase the access to sellers in the first place. A number of sellers and individuals could not even participate, could not get on the financial networks, and therefore could not participate in the economy.
This leads into one of the biggest highlights for the quarter for us, which was the launch of Square Terminal. We have seen these black rectangular boxes on countertops everywhere around the world, this is the common device that people use to accept a credit card and make a sale in the first place. We answered it originally by enabling people to take their mobile personal device like an iPhone or an Android device or an iPad and plug in one of our readers or pair it wirelessly. We decided that we could do better and serve an entirely new market by building an all-in-one device that doesn't require a third-party tool, and enables people to sell in the way that they are used to.
We built this with a touchscreen, we built this with a receipt printer, and we built this with usability and speed in mind. We launched it first in St. Louis and San Francisco and New York City. And we have pretty high expectations around it. One of the things that we are most excited about is to see how people use this. We do believe we built something with a lot of general utility, and that will enable people to use it in ways that we weren't necessarily expecting. We've already seen some of these used cases manifest in the form of restaurants using Square Terminal to go directly to their customers, right at the table and charge them right there, so bringing what an experience that you typically have within Europe into United States as well as this affords our sellers a lot more convenience and it saves their customers a whole lot more time, which enables our sellers ultimately to focus on making more sales.
Another highlight has been our work on the platform. We have built our company around a series of small internal APIs and SDKs that allows us teams to move very quickly to deliver new products that will benefit all of our customers. An example of how this is manifested in the past is through the Virtual Terminal, Square Virtual Terminal, which uses internal APIs and our internal platform to move really fast to come up with the product and then execute it immediately, so we can get it out to people as quickly as possible.
We added a dimension to our external developer platform this quarter that we call Reader SDK, which allows developers to connect directly to our hardware and build entirely new experiences like point-of-sale experiences that are not currently on our roadmap and things that we probably won't go in the direction of. One manifestation of this that we saw was Shake Shack, who uses our Reader SDK to power their kiosk which enables their customers to pre-order right at the location and then pick up their hamburger and their fries and go about their way. This ideally speeds people through the line and ultimately allows Shake Shack to sell more burgers, and enable them to see more customers. So, the platform continues to be a push for us and continues to be something that we focus on, allows us also to fully realize what we need to do in omni-channel commerce, which is enabling people to sell in every single channel and meet their customers where they are.
Finally, as you all know, we have kicked off a CFO search, and the CFO search is being led by David Viniar, who is our Lead Independent Director, and Roelof Botha, who is a Director on our Board, both former CFOs, who have a lot of experience and a great network of folks that can find a great CFO for us for the future. That search has been progressing. We have been interviewing over the past few weeks. We are seeing a ton of really amazing candidates; really happy with the quality, and also the amount of talent that we are seeing and also the alignment to our purpose. People want to come here, they want to help sellers make sales, they want to help extend access into the financial system and empower people into the economy, and that is what we are looking for the most.
We have a really high bar. We will not be sharing a timeline, but we are working with urgency and this is my number one focus at the company is to make sure we fill this role. We do have a benefit and advantage in that our company structure allows a lot of freedom and optionality and also autonomy through our various business units, so we do have a GM structure with leads for cash, for caviar, for seller, for the platform, for capital and they operate and make all the decisions around their business enabling me and our CFO to make investment decisions around the portfolio. The other advantage that we have across these businesses is they work together as an ecosystem, so they're encouraged in incentivized to make sure that they're providing tools and infrastructure, but also experiences that other business units can utilize. So that gives us a pretty good advantage in terms of running the business and managing the business going forward.
I do want to take a moment on behalf of myself, everyone at the company, and everyone on this call to say a huge thank you to Sarah. She has been an amazing partner to me, and amazing partner to our sellers and the folks that we serve, and we wish her all the best in her new adventure and her new role. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Sarah to share some of her highlights. Great. Thank you, Jack. So three things really stood out to me as highlights for this quarter; the first was the revenue growth we showed it scale, and I know you hear that from me every quarter, but every quarter I find it quite remarkable just how fast this company is growing. The second was EBITDA growth, so not only are we growing fast on the top line, but even as we grow I think we're showing really strong financial discipline. And then finally we did lift guidance, given the momentum we're seeing coming out of Q3 as we head into Q4.
Let me take a second on each of those. First, on the revenue growth, this is the sixth quarter of accelerating revenue growth. To put it in perspective, our total net revenue grew 48% year-over-year, 46% organically, but our adjusted revenue which is really what we focus on grew 68% year-over-year. Taking out the acquisitions of Zesty and Weebly which we did in Q2, that growth rate is 56% year-over-year, and that is still accelerating off of Q2, so I think that's remarkable, just really speaks to the strength of the ecosystem and the interplay that we see across all of our products where each of them makes the other stronger.
From a profitability standpoint, as I noted, adjusted EBITDA was $71 million that's up 107% year-over-year so that paced revenue growth, coming back to that point about showing financial discipline as we grow. From a GAAP perspective, it is worth noting that this is technically our first quarter of GAAP profitability where we had net income of $20 million but we want to be fully transparent about the impact from Eventbrite. So if you recall, a year ago, we made an investment in our partner Eventbrite. And we will work with them to bring Eventbrite GPV onto our platform as part of our marketplaces effort. Eventbrite had a very successful public offering in Q3 and we have to mark that investment to market, so it actually had about a $38 million positive impact in Q3 without it our net loss was actually $70 million.
And then finally just on the guidance front we are seeing strong momentum coming out of Q3 and so to that end we have raised the guidance of total net revenue to $3.26 billion to $3.27 billion, adjusted revenue is now guided to grow 60% at the midpoint that's a five point increase over the prior guidance. And again, just speaks to the momentum that I see in Square’s business right now and then finally adjusted EBITDA we're guiding $250 million to $255 million which is also a lift from the prior guidance.
So let me just close by saying it's been an incredible journey with this small private company that I joined when we had about 200 people into the juggernaut that I think I belong to today, and amazing strong public company that is having impact. Impact on our sellers, impact on their buyers, impact on consumers broadly and that makes me really proud, and I could only -- we can only do that because of the team that we have in place as well that are going to keep carrying it further and further from here. So I will be a supporter for life. Thanks everyone on the call for your support. I know sell side analysts don't often get a shout out, but you make us better by questioning us as you're about to do and we're appreciative of that.
So with that, let's turn it over to the operator for the questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Let me say upfront, Sarah, going to definitely miss working with you. I want to thanks for everything. From a question standpoint, not to get too emotional, the Square Terminal, I definitely want to ask you guys about Square Terminal. Is there a way, Jack or Sarah, to rank this in terms of importance as a product for Square? I presume it was a really big R&D investment. So any comment on what it might do, what it might bring in terms of volume or how it changes the TAM? And then also the gross margin model, should we assume it's going to be similar to your current hardware gross margin? Thanks. Yes, thanks for the question. So if you look at the market, we believe that this is huge. You see these black rectangular boxes; they're dinosaurs, like stegosauruses, everywhere in the world, not just within the United States, but everywhere around the world. And people have become accustomed to this form factor. One of the things that we hear from our sellers directly is they don't want to use their personal device to accept credit cards. And this gives them an option to make sure that they don't have to compromise on that. They can pick up a Square Terminal and use it for whatever they need. And one of the most exciting things to us about the launch of Terminal is that we fully expect them to surprise us with how they use it and where they use it.
We saw that with the original Square card reader, and I imagine we'll see the same by an order of magnitude more with Square Terminal. So this is a launch that we've been really excited about for quite some time. We're really excited to get it in peoples' hands and see what they do with it. I think from a company perspective and looking at our execution, this represents an immense amount of complexity that we were able to make very, very simple. This is end-to-end, this is hardware, and software, and operating system. It ties completely back to our cohesive ecosystem of seller tools, so it is an acquisition channel for us into that broader ecosystem which ultimately will help better retain customers as they continue to hire us for more and more things, like payroll, Square Capital, customer relationship management, and whatnot.
So this, yet again, removes another excuse from the table to join the Square ecosystem. And we're really proud of it, and really proud of what it represents. And then I'll let Sarah answer the affect on the gross margin. Sure. Thanks, Tien-tsin. So, just from a TAM perspective we did put in the shareholder letter that we see about two million standalone payment terminals in the U.S. alone. I think one place that folks often underestimate Square though is by just looking at current market and imagining the share we could take from that, rather than thinking about Greenfield opportunity. And I think that's really been the true unlock when we go into a market is doing the work to let sellers know why they should be up and on the system, whey they should be taking electronic payments. And I think this is yet another device to get there.
From a gross margin perspective, as you know with hardware, we have always leaned in on how we price our hardware. We do view the gross margin loss that we take is effectively a sales and marketing tool to get folks on, because then ultimately we can monetize them through the payments that pass over those devices, and by the other products that Jack talked about that then get attached. Overall, if you look at the business, we're still very much seeing a dollar in today has a three to four quarter payback period, and we're still seeing positive dollar-based retention, i.e., every cohort that joins effectively every year continues to grow, and that's still true of our youngest cohort.
So no change in how we will view hardware, although of course the hardware gross profit margin has actually been getting consistently better as time has gone on, particularly as products like Square Register and this new Square Terminal, we price them a little closer to cost. Great, thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks. And let me add my appreciation. I hope you continue to read Ponderings at some point, Sarah, we'll happily send it to you. I had a quick question, and this is a little nuanced. The GPV growth did break the 30 barrier this quarter. We saw a little bit of drop in the take rate. And then we've seen this discontinuation of this inflection up in net revenue growth in totality because of subscription services. And I'm just trying to reconcile if there's anything about the type of seller, the mix, or even some of the new solutions and the correlation that you get with GPV as you think about driving this model forward? Thank you. Sure, thanks, Dan. So, from a GPV growth perspective, I mean, I just view is still as more or less asymptoting. Like if you look back through the last five quarters, it's gone 31, 30, 30, 30, 29, which I just kind of view as more of the same, and that's how you build a really big business is when you can continue to grow at the same sort of pace even though your scale is building every single quarter, right. When you're doing $23 billion of GPV for the year you're starting to get into the greater than $80 billion for the year, right, these are big numbers, so no change there. What will continue to drive it is still micro. We still believe that there is massive opportunity of brining small businesses up and on to the system, and everything we launch is about how do we bring more to the system, as Jack talked about in his opening remarks.
Of course, there's the ongoing them move up market into larger merchants that you're alluding to. It really made me happy to see the percentage of GPV coming from larger merchants now, at 52% overall. Because it shows that the fulsome solution is resonating regardless what size you are. And then, of course, omni-channel is one of our three big pillars for the year, is a great way to make sure that we're there no matter how the buyer is coming to the seller. So whether they're offline or online, in a marketplace, you name it, we want to make sure we holistically get that whole book of business. And so that continues to drive growth. And then layer, finally, international on top of all of those things, those three things are true in every country that we look at.
In terms of take rate, as you know, I don't focus on the take rate. In the end, what we're optimizing for is how much dollar-based margin can we take home from a given seller or across a cohort of sellers. And so our goal is to get them up and on the platform. That does sometimes mean we'll custom price, for example, for the larger sellers, although keep in mind over 80% still self onboard, which I find remarkable. But then it's can we now up-sell and cross-sell them to things like payroll or capital or invoices or Square Marketing, you name it. Like that's really what we're going for ultimately is how do we maximize the dollars of margin. Thank you. Thank you. We will now take a call from Yassin Terou of Yassin's Falafel. Your line is open. Hi, all, hi, everyone. I'm a seller of Square, for been like now [first] [ph] year, and I love Square; I love the value that Square represents. But as a seller now and as a business to go from selling 20,000 chemicals in a year using a credit card to over $1 million a year. Now as our business is growing, other than love the value of the Square we have a lot of company, a lot of competitor reaching out to us and asking us how they can get our business, and how they can help, and they're trying to get the business of the merchant who use other than Square, they're trying to get the business of Square. So how I can answer them, or answer the small business who ask me the same question, saying, Square is good for small business, and not for a business who are doing over $1 million a year. Well, Yassin, it's really good to hear your voice. I mean, you're not just a business on Square, you're a movement. Very inspiring and congrats again on winning nicest place in America, you're the nicest person I know. Thank you. Thank you for your business. We get this question a lot, should we focus entirely on building for a small business or building for a larger business. Ultimately, we want to build a utility that scales with the business. And we want to make sure that when you use Square Register, for instance, or Terminal, that it is independent of the size of your business, and in some cases even the category of your business. And we need to make sure that we are scaling everything that we deliver to you, from the product, to pricing, to support in a way that scales with your business. And scaling with your business means that we continue to handle some of the trickier operations for you, so we're giving you effectively time back so you can focus more on the amazing business that you're building and focus a lot more attention on your customer.
So we love any feedback in terms of what we're seeing as friction to your growth, but ultimately it's the wrong answer for us if we're getting in the way of any one of our sellers grow. And we've seen a lot of sellers go from 10 locations in the United States, for instance, to over 40 in multiple countries around the world. And we want the same for all of our sellers who have that similar ambition. But if folks want to stay small we serve that too. So we build with an intention of scalability, and that people can use the exact same tool, and it grows with the business and ideally helps them grow as well. Thank you again. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Thanks guys. Sarah, I just want to say congrats to you again. But on the question side, we saw the Cash Card again moved up on the list of drivers, really beyond the very strong subscription in software side of the business. Is there any way you can give us more color on the run rate of spend you're seeing there or maybe update any details around the number of users since you did at the end of last year. Clearly, it seems like that is probably one of the key areas you're still investing. And then just maybe touch on the investment levels in that business. Thanks, guys. Sure. Why don't I start just on some of the more metric piece and Jack grab the how we're thinking about where the business goes from here. So we're not giving you more updates on this call. We talked about in Q2 on Cash Cards customers have spent $250 million in Q2, so $3 billion annualized, that was almost 3x from what we gave you back in December. And what I can say is we definitely continue to see really strong momentum. As you connote, Cash App continues to be a top 25 downloaded free app in the App Store really speaking, I think, ultimately to the utility that it's brining. So why don't I pass the baton to Jack there. So the Cash Card has been a pretty important driver for us. We do see people use the Cash App fundamentally as you would expect them to use a bank account. So they store money with us. They can direct deposits of paycheck using the ABA number that we give them. We can issue them a plastic card that's accepted anywhere Visa is accepted. They can use that same card to go to an ATM to withdraw paper cash. And of course, it is a peer-to-peer app as well, so they can send and receive money from friends and family. We continue to see a lot of value in adding more features on top of not just the Cash App but the Cash Card itself.
So Boost are a great example of this. This is one of the first times that I'm aware of that a rewards program within instant payback exists on a card where we're actually paying attention to where our customers go in the first place. So if you use your card at Lyft, for instance, you get an instant 10% back. If you use it to buy coffee you get an instant dollar back. If you use it for a food delivery service you also potentially get an instant 10% back. So we've been observing what our customers -- where our customers are spending the card, and then making sure that we are aligning the incentives with how we think about features and products going forward.
But all this comes back to us being able to serve a traditionally underserved and even un-banked audience because of our focus on access and because of our simplicity and just the point of view that we take within the app itself. So we're really excited about the continued momentum. We continue to see the results of this in things like the App Store downloads, for instance, where we consistently see the Cash App break into the top 20 of the top 250 free apps on the iOS App Store for instance. So it's a good lagging indicator of the attention it's getting and also the usage. But we're really pleased with the progress, and also pretty excited about what we can build on top of it. Yes. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon, guys. And I'll pile on, Sarah, we're -- congratulations and we're all going to miss you. I wanted to ask about Weebly. It's been a couple of quarters now, and I think Sarah you called out that omni-channel is one of your big pillars for the year. It's been a couple of quarters since you've had Weebly. Can you comment on some of the synergies that you're seeing, and then also just maybe an update on the broader strategy to participate more broadly in the high-growth ecom areas? Yes, thank you for the question. I'll start, Lisa, with the strategy. So we have a number of sellers who start offline, with offline businesses in the physical world and want to sell online. And we also have a number of sellers who are selling online today but want to open things like popup shops in physical locations to get more visibility in the communities that they're trying to serve and trying to get in to. We want to make that transition seamless. And that's the whole thesis behind getting Weebly and Square together in the first place is we don't want people to have to think about whether I'm selling online or offline, that we just want them to think about selling. And that means meeting your customer where they are, whether they be halfway around the world through an ecommerce channel, through coming through your door in the first place.
So we're going to make sure that we're building as much flexibility for our sellers as possible. Weebly was always interesting to us because we've had a long-term partnership with them, so we knew a lot about the company, what they cared about, what their purpose, and we saw a lot of alignment and it just made perfect sense to get the two companies together. We'd been working together through a partnership as one of our options through our partnership network. And as we have gotten together we've started asking the questions of what's most important to integrate and taking this from a customer use case direction. So like what is most critical to get a seller going and started immediately so they can sell immediately, both in an offline world and in an online world.
So you'll continue to see update to Weebly and Square to that effect. But all this is going towards that goal of being able to serve sellers across multiple channels, and not making them think about which channel they're selling in to so they can focus entirely on making the sale, and ideally making more sales. Perfect, thank you. And then just maybe quickly as my follow-up, I'll just ask the question about macro. I realize no sign of a recession yet, but given your exposure to the small business segment and then also the working capital side of your business, how do you think about the impact of an eventual macroeconomic slowdown? Thank you. Sure. So clearly we're in Q3, seeing tremendous momentum in our business and adjusted revenue is growing 68% year-over-year, 56% organically. Clearly that's very symptomatic of a strong macro, but also the value proposition that Jack just talked about, that if you're on Square we're helping you grow your business, never miss that sale, and we're finding other tools that make it more and more seamless, whether it's access to capital through Square Capital, access to things like payroll and so on, so doing that the best that we can. The other things I look at, the NFIB Index is always one to go back to in my opinion. I think it was at 108, 107.9 in September. So it remains near an all-time high.
So, clearly the expectations from small businesses are high, and you can see that in the guidance that we gave you too for the full-year, so 60% at the midpoint. As we look forward and think about the impact in any recession, I think it's important to note, first, the payments are not discretionary. So unlike, say, a tool that you might use just to grow your business, payments is not something you're going to suddenly decide to not accept when times are tougher. We also think our value proposition is one that includes a lower total cost of ownership. And so part of that is because of the cohesion of what we've built, so that you're getting that hardware that is best in class, but it's completely linked into the software. You're getting all of the pieces of managed payments that are built around that.
And so we know that when people do a side-by-side that Square always compares quite well from a pricing perspective. And then beyond that, it's about how do we build diversity into the seller types and into the different products that we have. We think that diversity of the ecosystem will help ballast in any sort of downturn. And then, finally from a risk perspective, we were born in a world where we had to move money off the get -- and from the get-go. So we've always used machine learning. I think the stat we gave you most recently is 99.95% of all payments that pass through Square are automatically passed or failed, they don't touch a human being, and that's because of the investment that we've done in machine learning and deep learning to do that.
And so our belief is that we'll also make sure that when we do things like Square Capital or the new consumer Installments that we're being very mindful of the risks that we're taking, and using the best possible technology to do it well. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask on Square Installments, how does Square get paid there? And then secondly, as a quick follow-up, as we start to think about next year. Is the formula still going to be to invest for top line or do we go back to growing EBITDA margin expansion mid single digits? Thanks. Sure. So from an Installments perspective it's very analogous to what we do with Square Capital with the sellers. So in the case of an installment, right there at the point-of-sale or maybe online, the consumer says, you know I would like to pay for this purchase over an extended period of time and if they click yes to that, there's a really neat customer experience that happens, but in effect, we pay out the seller. So the seller is not good to go move on with their business, and we take on the filtration of that consumer loan and then in effect as they pay us back we're making money as the payments are returned to us. And I think our long-term strategy there would be very similar to what we do with capital today in terms of making use of third-party investors to make sure we true scale that off of our balance sheet.
In terms of looking out to next year, we're still in the midst of annual planning. It's fun to see just new roadmap starting to emerge, and just how many different opportunities the company has in front of us. We will lean into those three pillars that we talked to you about in 2018, omni-channel, banking services, and international. Those were meant to be areas that had longevity to them that you wouldn't just do them all in a year, and I think we have real momentum in all three as we head into 2019, so from that perspective maybe a quicker earlier read our expectation on top line growth for 2019 is greater than 40% percent adjusted revenue growth. Go back to what I said in my opening remarks I find it really incredible that at the scale Squares that we can still put up numbers like that and then from an EBITDA perspective you should expect margin expansion similar to what we have achieved right now in 2018. Overall my net takeaway is we still see a huge amount of opportunity in front of us. We want to keep investing against that but we want to do it with financial discipline. Okay, that's helpful. And Sarah, you'll be missed; good luck. Thanks, Ryan. Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and Sarah good luck and you will be missed. I guess my question would be to put it the previous question all the differently more for Jack. Sarah is You've been CFO, you've sort of established an unwritten contract with investors to deliver higher revenue growth with maybe a little bit less EBITDA margin expansion and sometimes investment phases of the business and conversely if well if the growth business were to slow a bit, deliver more EBITDA margin expansion. So I guess, Jack, are you what level are you committed to that philosophy on a go-forward basis regardless of who's CFO Square? Yes, we're committed to formulas that work. We're not expecting significant changes in plans with the addition of a new CFO. We have a business that is highly efficient and we are capable of continuing to make investments around inventing new technologies to serve our customers but all of it has to follow from being able to innovate and to serve our customers in new markets and in new ways, so we're letting that lead us ultimately and making sure that we're delivering something that is remarkable, that stands out from everyone else and continuing to build into and best in our differentiators as set us apart.
Number one is that cohesiveness of our ecosystem, number 2 is the speed at which you can start with Square, number 3 is our ability to be more self serve than our competitors and number four is the elegance of our designs and also our hardware. And by increasing each of those four dimensions we continue to win the market, so that is what will be continuing and that's what we're focused on. Discipline has always been really important to this company has been so since day one and we benefit from the amount of discipline we have an also the amount of understanding and control the business that we have as well. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, if you look at the software solutions, you've launched whether that's Square for retail or the restaurants or others or payroll for example and maybe give us a sense of how those have been tracking on the market, how they've been adopted which ones you're most excited about but also ultimately in the next two to three years how big piece of the revenue of Square, do you expect him to be on a subscription revenue basis. Start with the first part of that question, so we did see a pretty big opportunity not only to think about our offerings in a more vertical way like for restaurants and retail and services but also to add more services like payroll that help increase the operational efficiency of one of our sellers and really meeting one of their core and critical needs, so we've built these with an ecosystem mindset.
We've built these with a mindset of each one should be an acquisition channel for us; each one should introduce other products within the ecosystem. So that people are aware of the fact that they may come in as a restaurant but wow I can also add delivery as a superpower to my restaurant through Caviar and I can also pay all my employees now in all 50 states with Square payroll and I can communicate with my customers through the receipts through our CRM products, so we want to make sure that we are being hired for multiple jobs, multiple parts of the business so our emphasis is on the ecosystem and how they all work together rather than each individual part.
And as we look out years ahead, we want to strengthen that ecosystem. We want to enrich it we want to fill it with you know services that are most critical to help a seller grow their business and then, we've added this new dimension of consumer with Square Cash and even that is pushing back into the ecosystem, we talked about not too long ago how we pay our Caviar careers through Square Cash you have an option of getting your payroll through Square Cash which allows you to get instant access to your funds or use the cash card, so you can imagine a lot of integrations are extremely beneficial to a seller and also to an individual so the strength of ecosystem is really something we want to continue to build and we're really excited about. And then Jim maybe just on the percentage of total revenue, I mean I would pull you back from thinking about it as segmented out that way, so frankly what you see in our P&L is the business model with which we've chosen to monetize a particular product and we typically try to match it to the place where we think most value is being created on the other side for the customer, so for example software products like invoices and appointments for sole proprietors those only get monetized through a payment business model. So for example an invoice is 2.9 and $0.30.
If you look at appointments we change it back in Q2, so if you're a sole proprietor it cost 2.75% for the cost of making the booking or effectively the consumer paying you for the appointment but there's no cost to the software. There's other places where we lean the other way and we recognize that, perhaps we want to make sure there is a software fee payroll is one of those examples and even there you'll see as kind of shift around between maybe a monthly fee and then a fee per actual employee because as we more and more can push employees towards cash app.
As a vehicle for them to get quick access to their payroll then we can actually monetize that through the card that they take, that they then go spend anywhere in the United States so Wal-Mart or if they go online with Amazon or left or whomever and so I think that is goes back to the strength of the ecosystem that Jack just spoke to from a product perspective but it also creates a very strong business model too because we have multiple levers and decisions around where to monetize, so we don't just sit and think okay, what can subscription services be as a percent of revenue is kind of a forward luck. Does that make sense? Yes, it does thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ryan Carey on for Jason. I want to ask bit about transaction-based profit margins, I would assume there would be some pressure as large margins can become a bigger percent of GPV and as Eventbrite on board today you've clearly done a nice job offsetting this with the higher revenue products, looking forward to expect transaction profitability will remain generally stable or at some point to the impact from a larger merchant become too large to offset. Great. Thanks, Ryan. So I think you're kind of nailing the putting the taken away that in many cases particularly at the take rate level there are some products were clearly were able to price higher than 2.75%, so things like virtual terminal things like our API platform. And those have clearly had an upward inflationary impact on both take rate and then even in many cases on transaction profits. If you look at there are other sides to that the U.K. is often the one I use where we start out pricing at 1.75% so effectively would have deflationary impact on take rate but the margin there actually is quite good because it's a very heavily regulated market, so there's kind of puts and takes on all five. Ultimately as we add larger merchants in particularly as we do marketplace says.
We absolutely want to make sure we remain competitive because what we are going to solve for is absolute dollars and how do we make sure we keep growing absolute dollars of gross profit and ultimately absolute dollars of EBITDA and so we have shown with larger sellers that we willing to we're willing to be flexible where it's made sense but I think also as we just bring them more value in the product, they are willing to hit the bed in terms of our pricing. Joe & The Juice was a good example of a seller in our shareholder letter, we're clearly they're quite large hundreds of locations. I think across the United States. And yes they're willing to be on the Square platform because we give them that wonderful checkout experience with Square hardware so as long as we keep adding value into the ecosystem. We feel very good about the value we're bringing and hence the profit dollars that we can make. Great, thanks for taking my questions. Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Yes, thank you and Sarah congrats a great run at Square and best of luck in your next role. I wanted to ask on the Square Reader SDK. and I'm just wondering as you get into new verticals like healthcare, if we could see maybe an increase in the number of ISP partners that you're working with above and beyond maybe what you were achieving when you were just offering build with Square. And then secondarily, any updates you can share on Eventbrite timing and how to think about the volumes there? Yes, on the Square reader SDK, certainly the potential exists for four new radicals and we seen some people dabbling within this, the most important thing for us within all of our SDK is not just Reader SDK is to make sure that we're attracting developers and to do that we're, we focus on the developer experiments, experience that we provide make it simple and straightforward. But also taking opportunities to bring them all together, so we recently completed our annual partnership conference which brought a bunch of our developers together to share what we're focused on what's new and to get them talking and get them focus on providing more and more remarkable solutions forward for their customers.
So we do see this as a way to expand into entirely new verticals that we don't currently have on our roadmap and watch an experiment and learn ultimately. In terms of Eventbrite timing we have we had nothing to disclose today but we'll keep you updated as we have more meaningful information. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Hi, congratulations on the job you done Sarah and best of luck to you. Thanks, Jeff. I could just ask a follow up on your earlier commentary about subs and services revenue it seems like you guys are pretty are trying to focus on value added services, so I understand what you're saying about the various components and how they shop into the lines in the income statement but if we look at the contribution of subs and service reading I believe it's 40% this quarter versus 25% a year ago but I just want ask if you can maybe a elaborate a little bit about how you see that contribution to total adjusted revenue, changing over time, we ever get to the point where we see call it 50% or so of Squares revenue coming from subs and service just an example. Sure, thanks Jeff, so I mean it has been an amazing area for us so when a business is growing at 165% year-over-year or 117% excluding acquisitions. I mean clearly it has a lot of momentum to add. If you look at what's within the subscription service that really drove that growth in some deposit, caviar, capital and cash card all are for areas that we called out. Within instant deposit it's worth noting that is symptomatic of both a way that we can continue to monetize the seller base by giving them more speed as Jack talked about one of the elements of a remarkable solution the fast, and by giving them instant access to their taking for the day. We can really change the whole equation of working capital for them but also on the cash side instant has become a really high utility for consumers that are sending P2P. And so that growth and instant deposit is also symptomatic of just how well cash app has continued to do beyond that you know caviar we talked about it in Q2 still growing at 100% year-over-year in Q2 and that momentum continues.
Capital you can see a very nice quarter up 34% percent year-over-year, and I talked a little bit earlier about why capital is so important to the overall business. And then finally, cash card is net new, if you recall, we didn't have it a year ago, or we're just beginning, it's now become the fourth largest contributor, and again I think that comes back to the utility, the cash generally is bringing. So I don't want to put a stick in the ground of when 50% is possible, but I can tell you that certainly the products that are monetized through subscription services, all of them feel very healthy right now with a lot of momentum as we go into Q4. Thanks very much, I appreciate that. And then, a question for Jack, I was wondering if you could explain some details about your thinking with how you built the cash up, you know, clearly you have all the credibility in the world in the realm of social media, so my question is what do you see as the pros and cons of having a social feeding cash up? And you know, have you ever considered doing that? Thanks. This is a good question. So we definitely have considered and learned from what our peers in the industry are doing around making peer-to-peer transactions more social. I think we do have opportunity to certainly open communication channels within the cash up, probably not in the same way that our peers have done, but there is a big differentiator from how we think about the cash up versus others. We don't see as peer-to-peer stop. We see it as a way to provide banking services for folks, and that is the audience that we are serving and that's where we are seeing the most resonance within the market. So we see people throw their money. We see people spend their money on the cash card and withdraw from ATMs and deposit their paychecks through the direct deposit function. We see people buying bitcoin, and of course we see people with peer-to-peer transactions, but our focus is really on the spending aspect of cash, and recognizing every channel that people want to spend money within, and then making that a lot easier and then giving them more availability and access to features that they typically haven't in the past like Boost is a good example, that's where a lot of the folks that we serve just have never had access to rewards program, much less one that rewards for the places they already go to, and does so instantly.
So, our focus is really observing what our customers are doing and then taking as much friction out as possible, while adding some magic at the same time. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. This is Oscar Turner on for Andrew. My question is on Square for restaurants, just wondering if you can give any color on the uptake you're seeing with a new product, and whether that's expected to materially contribute to revenue next year? And then also related, what do you see as the biggest barriers to penetrating the large full service restaurant TAM? Yes, so great questions, we do have a significant focus on restaurants right now, and I'm really happy with what we have to offer restaurants. So in the past, the only way that we could serve restaurants was through Caviar by adding delivery and not super-power to their offering. And what's meaningful about this is that they're no longer constrained by the number of tables they have and how quickly they can turn them over. Delivery allows them to make more and sell more, which ultimately drives more sales. We recently added Pick Up which allows the restaurant to offer pick up, so someone can come and get food and take it elsewhere. And we recently introduced Square for Restaurants, which allows them to do things like table management, but also allows them to hook up with the kitchen display systems, so that they can operationalize and make more efficient their kitchen. So ultimately they can serve more food and serve more customers.
So, we are putting a lot of our focus on the integration of these things, so that if you come in through Square for Restaurants, you will be able to eventually Caviar for delivery and vice versa. We think that's really powerful, but even more powerful is introducing them to the rest of our ecosystem like payroll, like our customer relationship management, like Square Capital for instance. And the biggest barrier in the past had been the fact that we don't have a point-of-sale for restaurants, we didn't have anything that can help them manage their tables. Now that we do, and we are full stack, meaning that we can handle their payments as well. They see an opportunity to remove a bunch of clutter from the countertops and a bunch of time from their operations, their day-to-day operations. It's a lot of work to run the restaurant, and it's extremely complex and our goal is to help keep restaurants in business and help them grow. And a big part of that is just streamlining their operations, so that they are not spending time fixing equipment and learning how to operate these technologies, but actually really focus on making food and serving their customers.
So we think we have observed that barrier, also started to overcome it, and that will help us certainly to get into restaurants of all size from very small to multi-chain and very large businesses as well, but we are going to learn and talk to sellers about what's working, what's not working, and make sure we are addressing those needs. Yes. And then from a -- I'm sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead. I was just going to say from a TAM perspective or an impact to revenue, I mean, clearly we went into the restaurant vertical because it is a massive TAM. There are over 300,000 folks in these restaurants. Here in the U.S. alone that's $200 billion of annual gross proceeds. So when we talk about how will we continue to sustain this sort of GPV growth, that is the big part of it, it's how do we keep unlocking more and more new places where Square have not really been in place before.
So, as we talked about last quarter, we see larger restaurants come on the platform, the average GPV in the restaurant seller is about $650,000. But the fun thing is also to see that they're self onboarding. So unlike when they work with an old competitor where it's like bang it, I don't want to keep using this, instead they sell onboard something like Square for restaurants and have that easy experience that Jack talked about. So we do think it has a big potential TAM, and we do think it will continue to contribute meaningfully to revenue as we go into 2019. Okay, thanks for that color.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.
First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.

Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I wanted to start off with a few brief comments, and then turn it over to Amrita for some prepared remarks. First and foremost, I want to welcome Amrita to her first Square earnings call. We’re thrilled to have her as our CFO and really excited about the years ahead.
I’m going to start with what we believe our core differentiator is, which is an ecosystem. We are an ecosystem of financial tools for both individuals and sellers, and we continue to prove the power and the uniqueness of that as time goes on.
One of the things I’m most proud of over the past 10 years, Square turned 10 back in – back a few weeks ago is that we’ve shown a lot of discipline in long-term investments, and these longer-term investments that we made some bets on have really paid off. A really good example of this has been the Cash App.
Today, we’re announcing that we have over 15 million monthly active customers in December of 2018, and that’s more than double year-over-year. This is an amazing to start building – this is amazing to start building an ecosystem focused on financial services for individuals, but it also speaks to the power of building ecosystems, so that we can build seller products faster as well.
All the tech that we’ve built for the Cash App powers other product ecosystems as well. So Instant Deposit came from Cash App technology as did the Square Card. The Square Card has been another highlight over the past three months. This is a way for us to continue to serve underserved and unbanked sellers, so that they can start a business without even going to a bank, literally be able to download the Register from the App Store or Google Play. And we give them an account, where they can store their money and also a MasterCard debit card, which they can use anywhere to grow their business.
We are a really good seller. Example here, C.C. Nedrow of Payton’s Photography. She used Square since its earliest days. She’s also been using Square Card to buy supplies as soon as she needs them, and she also uses Square Invoices, Square Marketing, and Square Capital, and this really speaks to the power of the ecosystem. People can come for one thing and then see a whole host of other financial services to help them stay in business and also grow their business.
The most important thing about Square Card, though, is it enables them to quickly invest in their business, and it gives them access to their funds immediately, so they can go off and do the right things for their business whether it be buy more marketing or buy a new salon chair to add more capacity to their offering.
One of the things we’ve found with our beta sellers for Square Card is that 40% of them didn’t have a business debit card before, and this is meaningful, because we found that a lot of sellers were mixing their personal bank accounts with what their business was doing, which is very, very hard to manage, took time away from their work and ultimately took time away from making more sales.
So we believe this is going to be really powerful for sellers and it really speaks to longer-term investments that we’ve made, the bets we’ve made, and how they’re paying off right now.
For the year ahead, we continue to focus on three things. We’re going to continue to strengthen our omni-channel offering. That means that we add strength to in-person payments, to mobile payments, and also to online. We’re really excited about everything we’re doing in financial services. This captures everything from Cash App to Square Card to Payroll to Square Capital.
And finally, we’re – we continue to focus on the international markets that we’re in, making them stronger, more complete, and making sure that we find product market fit for the majority of our ecosystem. We’re excited to continue to roll out more of our ecosystem tools and services to all of our markets.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Amrita. Thank you, Jack. I wanted to start by saying that I’m thrilled to be a part of Square. I joined, because I’m passionate about Square’s purpose of economic empowerment. There’s massive opportunity ahead for us and Square’s teams are moving with urgency, operational excellence, and creative agility to serve our customers. It’s rare and meaningful to find such a strong alignment of doing good and doing well, and I’m excited to be a part of Square’s journey.
Our results for fourth quarter and full-year 2018 highlight the momentum in our business. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we drove strong revenue growth at scale. Total net revenue was $933 million, up 51% year-over-year overall and up 47%, excluding acquisitions. Adjusted revenue was $464 million, up 64% year-over-year overall and up 53%, excluding acquisitions.
Net loss was $28 million in the fourth quarter, which includes the mark-to-market valuation of our strategic investment in Eventbrite. Excluding this impact, net loss was $12 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $81 million in the fourth quarter, up 97% year-over-year. Our ecosystems for sellers and for individuals drove growth in the quarter.
On the seller side, we maintained strong cohort economics, with a three to four quarter payback period for new cohorts and positive adjusted revenue retention for existing cohorts. This underscores the continued efficacy of our go-to-market strategy as our business scales, both in acquiring new sellers efficiently and helping them grow once they join Square.
Additionally, we drove momentum with larger sellers. In the fourth quarter, larger sellers made up 51% of overall GPV, up from 47% in the fourth quarter of 2017. GPV from this group grew 39% year-over-year. One reason larger sellers come to Square is for our omni-channel solutions, as 30% of our larger sellers serve their customers via more than one channel on Square.
For individuals, we drove rapid growth at scale for Cash App. As Jack mentioned, we had more than 15 million monthly active Cash App customers in December 2018, which more than doubled year-over-year.
We’ve been delivering growth at scale and operating leverage in our business, which enables us to reinvest and drive product velocity , which in turn can generate meaningful revenue in the long-term. Products launched in the last five years represented 37% of total net revenue and 51% of adjusted revenue in the fourth quarter, up 15 points from a year ago.
Now turning to guidance. For full-year 2019, we expect total net revenue to be within a range of $4.35 billion to $4.41 billion and adjusted revenue to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.25 billion. At the midpoint, this represents 41% year-over-year adjusted revenue growth, which is remarkable given our scale.
For full-year 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $405 million to $415 million, which represents growth of 60% at the midpoint. Given the massive opportunity ahead of us, we continue to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth, guided by financial discipline.
We’re excited to expand our seller and consumer ecosystems to provide more people with more tools to participate in the economy.
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Thanks, guys. Nice job on the quarter and look to working – look forward to working with you, Amrita. Let me just start off, guys. I mean, subscription and services growth continues to be obviously extremely strong and Cash App seems to be just a very big part of that. The numbers you gave were really helpful. If you could just give us more insight into the driving forces behind the growth in Cash App numbers and how sustainable it is?
And then, maybe a better breakdown on the revenue sizes of each aspect to that, correlated to the Cash App. And then, maybe if you can even give what percentage of Cash App users are monetized so far just at least to help us. Thanks, again, guys. Hi, Darrin, I look forward to working with you as well. So let me start by sharing a little bit about the strength of the business model for Cash App, and then I’ll share a little bit about the monetization as well.
So we’re very pleased with the progress that we’ve seen with Cash App. We are driving meaningful revenue contribution, along with network growth and network engagement, and that is driven by the strength of the business model we see there, and just to underscore some of those points, where we see a massive opportunity ahead of us to enable access to financial services. There are over 25% of U.S. households are unbanked or underbanked, and clearly, as a top 20 app in 2018, Cash App is now achieving mainstream scale.
In terms of the dynamics underlying the business, we see really strong network effects, which when you combine that with frictionless onboarding, which the team has been very focused on, drives efficient acquisition at scale. And then we’re also seeing really strong engagement with Cash App, which we measure by transactions per active, which is also increasing – increase the compound effect when coupled with the increasing reach of the overall app.
We’re continuing to drive daily utility for that engagement through new features like card boosts and direct deposit. And this team is just executing very well at a high-level right now. We’re delivering new and refined products with quality and speed.
The speed with which we can deliver, given the mobile platform is obviously greater than what you see with traditional financial services experience. And it’s that rapid iteration, which drives, not only product velocity, but scale and daily utility. So that’s just a little bit about why we’re excited about the underlying trends and momentum that we see with the business model for Cash App.
From a monetization perspective, there are a number of revenue streams and a variety of levers that we have in the business, and we’ve really just gotten started. There’s four to highlight today, obviously, Instant Deposit, which is similar to our -- Instant Deposit product in our sellers’ business enables instant access to stored balances.
There is Cash Card, which the last number that we had mentioned was $3 billion of annualized spending as of the second quarter and which continues to grow rapidly, where we make interchange. There’s P2P when funded with credit cards, and then there’s cryptocurrency, where we make a spread. And again, we’re just at the beginning of this opportunity. There’ll be future products and services and opportunities to build engagement, which we can eventually monetize for the future. [Multiple Speakers] The only thing I would add there… Go ahead. Sorry, Darrin. The only thing I would add there is, we’re starting to see the network effects play out. So the P2P aspect – and I think the biggest driver of growth for us is the product itself has inherent network effects. And you can see this yourself on Fridays of weeks inside the United States, where we do see huge surge in downloads because of payday, and people are utilizing the money they have in Cash App to some of their friends, families, landlords causing another download and another up into the network.
So that has kept us in the top 20 at the App Store for quite sometime. We reached number one, not too long ago this year. But I think, the biggest driver is really going to be how the network is spreading and just the inherent network effects that it has in the business. And as we add more utility and more financial services, such as the card or sort of balance or Instant Deposit, ATM, it just becomes a much, much more durable relationship. Yes. Just quickly, I mean, do you guys ever disclose about what percentage of the 15 million users have actually been monetized in some way? Just trying to figure out how much runway? It seems like it’s very early obviously. Thanks, again, guys. Yes. We haven’t disclosed that. But as Amrita said, over those four areas into Deposit, Cash Card, P2P, and cryptocurrency, we have – we just have a ton of levers to pull on in terms of where the app takes revenue. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi, guys, congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask about Square Card for business. Can you just talk a little bit about how it differentiates itself from the competition and how you plan to drive more small business engagement there?
And then secondly, just looking at the guidance, I know seasonality plays a role. But it looks like the first quarter EBITDA margin guidance at the midpoint is somewhere around 10.3%, that would be down from 11.7% a year ago. So just trying to figure out is there extra investments going in that’s driving margins down a little bit year-over-year? Thanks so much. Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. Square Card is one of the things I’m most excited about this year just because we’ve identified a real pain point in a seller’s life and in sign up for Square. We – one of the things we ask for traditionally is to link a bank account. So that you can receive your funds after you swipe your customer’s credit cards. And now you can literally download the register and download our app and now we offer a place to store your money.
But more importantly, we give you an opportunity to get a card that you can customize, that’s a Master card, which you can use anywhere. And we think this is pretty powerful in the same way that Instant Deposit was, because it gives access to funds. And access to funds is so critical for any small business, if they can quickly access their money and spend it to grow their business in whatever situation they find themselves in, we tend to see their sales increase.
So we think this is – well, I don’t know of anyone else offering anything like this, especially with the breadth of our ecosystem. So I think it’s inherently unique, inherently differentiated, and I can’t think about simpler sign up flow to get a card, that’s customized your business, but also is a simple way to start.
So you can start a business without even having to go to a bank, which is pretty powerful, pretty profound and really cool. And we don’t think this is just for small businesses. We think this can scale and we’re really excited about adding more functionality on top of the card. Hey, Bryan, it’s Amrita. I’ll take the guidance question for Q1. I want to emphasize two things. First and foremost that we focus on the full-year in terms of how we manage the business and in terms of how you should be looking at it from a guidance perspective. And secondly, that there is some seasonality in Q1, which is why we really focus on the full-year.
So, again, just to grant you the numbers for the full-year, we expect to grow over 40% on the top line and 60% on the bottom line, delivering similar margin expansion to what we delivered in 2018, which at 2.2 – over $2.2 billion of revenue is pretty remarkable growth at our scale.
From a Q1 perspective, we’re showing 55% adjusted revenue growth year-over-year. But it is important to note that there are some seasonal trends in the business that particularly effect our seller business, which impacts sequential growth and revenue profit and profitability.
So from a revenue perspective, we see a seasonally slower quarter in Q1 relative to the Q4 holiday season, which again impacts profitability. And these seasonal trends, Bryan have been in the business for each of the last three years, if you look back. Also from a timing perspective, we are making deliberate investments in our business earlier in the year, beginning in Q1, which we expect to drive growth for the medium to long-term. Okay, very helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Thank you, and welcome to the call, Amrita. Just, Jack, I wanted to get your perspective on some things. I know you just said you’re excited about Cash Cards, but looking back to last year, Instant Deposit really carried the load and it’s a surprise to the upside in 2018. So looking at this year, what products do you think are best positioned to drive our lead growth in 2019? In other words, what’s this year’s Instant Deposit? Yes. I think, – so a few things here. One, I’m really proud of how far Cash Card has come. Those are significant bet for the company. We’re going against major incumbents. We – it did require a lot of thoughtfulness, a lot of push on our side and a lot of patience as well, and we continue to see every single day that proving out.
But the most important thing is, it allows us to move superfast with other products like Square Card. And we’re not like lollygagging around and just, like being saw development anymore, because we can move fast, because we have all of this infrastructure at our disposal that allows us to build something like square card in a very short timeframe, when considering our past 10 years.
So I think the thing I’m – apart from Square Card and just everything that we can place on top of it and reach the seller community in the same way that we’re reaching individuals with Cash App is. I think, people are finally starting to see the power of our ecosystem, and they’re not just seeing us as separate parts and separate tools, but the entire ecosystem.
So I think the biggest driver is as we make more of those connections and more of those integrations, people will see it as one unit. And that’s – that starts with our customers, but certainly our shareholders, our investors and folks in the industry, we don’t have a lot of competition in that regard. I think, we’re fairly unique in the ecosystem way.
And this ecosystem mindset is not just around our services, but it’s also around our developer platform as well. So as a developer coming to our platform, you get your access online, you get your access in-app and you get your access hardware, all in one place. And as we continue to improve that experience, we just provide a much more powerful option, not only for developers and their small business customers, but their larger merchant customers as well.
One of the real strengths of the developer ecosystem for us has been an ability for a larger seller to take the parts of our ecosystem that they want custom fit into their shops or their restaurants, connected with legacy systems that they may have. So it’s not disruptive to their business and continue to carry on without missing a beat. So we think it’s a really powerful equation and you’ll see us continue to add to the ecosystem equation to continue to strengthen that as a unit rather than just like the individual parts. So that gets mesuper excited this year. Thanks then. Tien-tsin, thank you so much for the – welcome. Maybe I’ll underscore a couple of the points that Jack made with few of the things that get us excited about the momentum we have carrying us from a very strong 2018 into 2019, and some of the focus areas for us in 2019. As we’ve said, we’re coming into 2019 from a position of strength, exiting 2018 with 61% growth and $1.6 billion of adjusted revenue. And that growth at scale was driven by a diversity of growth levers.
We had positive revenue retention and a consistent three to four quarter payback period for new sellers. We saw new cohorts of sellers, driving higher levels of adjusted revenue and an increasing mix of larger sellers. And then as you’ve heard, we have tremendous scale in our Cash App ecosystem now at over 15 million monthly actives up 2x year-over-year.
We’re seeing growth from Instant Deposit, but we’re also seeing meaningful growth from Cash Card and we see a future opportunity to continue building out that Cash App ecosystem driving further engagement. So 2019 just quickly to take off some of the key focus areas for us to drive that over 40% of adjusted revenue growth over $2.2 billion.
We’re going to take a long-term approach, as we always have to our strategic priorities. So 2019 will be a continuation of that. We will be focused on launching and scaling new products as ever.
So some of the things you might see investing in our seller ecosystem with vertical service – vertical specific offerings, restaurants, retail services continuing to scale our recent launches, including the expansion of the developer platform, Square Card and Terminal, where we’re seeing strong early traction on both. And all of those products are really going to help enable us to reach new customers and new segments, while increasing engagement across the ecosystem. Good stuff. Thank you, both. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of [Quest Skinner]. Your line is open. Hello. How are you guys? Very amazing to hear all of this. I’ve been with Square for over years now, and I have a Square Card and Cash App. But one thing I can say is, I know it’s made easy for me to quickly buy my supplies, my materials. But what other services would you guys be planning to offer that would allow me to transition from my traditional banking system completely over to this new infrastructure in which you’re designing? Yes, thank you, Quest, and thanks for letting us feature you during the Square Card launch and also on the earnings letter. Thank you. So we’re – the way we think about the developing forward is looking at the most critical pain points that our sellers and our customers experience, and then figuring out very, very simple accessible ways to solve some of those issues.
And we do have a breadth of services that were excited about in that regard everything from payroll to Square Capital that you can imagine, handling more and more of the needs that you might have from a traditional banking partner that we could save your trip to. So we’re – with a Square Card, we’re going to learn super fast and make sure that we’re identifying areas where we could be helpful.
One of the things I’m proud to serve in the Square Card as we decided to like really recognize and honor the seller community that naturally builds. So one of the things we did is anytime you use your Square Card at another Square Seller, that seller doesn’t pay the fee. So we handle that 2.75%, and we think that’s awesome as a way to give back to our sellers. But things like that where we can really solve critical needs for folks is where you’re going to see more of. We’re open to ideas as well, so keep them coming.? Oh, for sure, I’ve got a few. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Quest. I appreciate it. Bye. Have a good evening. I appreciate it. Thank you. I appreciate you, guys. Bye. I appreciate you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open. Thanks. Good evening. I have a question. If you could give us some sense around the interchange economics for Square Card versus Cash Card? And then secondarily, I’m wondering, are you seeing users on the Cash Card side, where previously they were Instant Deposit users kind of converting over to being Cash Card users, with the idea that you’re going to porting the cost burden to the merchant in this interchange model versus charging the consumer for instance deposit? Thanks. Hey, Dan, thanks for the question. So in the first part of your question with regard to interchange economics, of course, is a business prepaid debit card, where Square makes money is on the interchange on the purchases. The interchange is publicly available through Master Card spread tables. What we’re really focused on is driving greater utility, which leads to hiring engagement and ultimately drives higher customer lifetime value. That’s a similar approach to what we took with Cash Card similar with Square Card. I’m sorry, Dan. Could you just repeat the second part of your question? I didn’t fully understand it? Sure, sure. So you’ve historically had Instant Deposit, which is something you would charge the consumer for. But you can move those funds to your Cash Card, so that you can utilize those anywhere Master Card is accepted, which is great. The question is this Instant Deposit a long-term viable business model. And if it, let’s just say, hit the maturation curve is Cash Card, the way in which to move that consumer over. So that they’re no longer being charged. They are basically – you’re basically taking the economics and pushing that onto the merchant? Does that makes sense? Got it. Yes, that makes sense. So just to clarify some things. We – so you can store money within the Cash App. And if you want to move it to your bank account, that’s where Instant Deposit takes place. So we charge 1.5% to instantly move at your bank account, otherwise you wait two, three days for it to transfer.
We have seen – we do have the Cash Card, which allows instant spend and we do have economics from that as well. We generally want to be agnostic, but we believe that keeping people within the Cash App and that ecosystem is generally positive first for the customers and also for us because of the other financial services that we’re going to continue to look at and add and utility that we’re going to add to the card.
So a lot of it has to do with just making sure that we’re providing something that is – that has daily utility to folks from peer-to-peer to the card. But if they want to go to their traditional banking instrument, they can do that. And they can do that for free with a delay or they can do it instantly with Instant Deposit. So we see these things as complementary and we’re even more confident in that, because we – right now, we have four areas, where we monetize the Cash App as well. So it provides enough diversification that we have for resilience. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok of KBW. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the first question I have is just around the momentum of moving upmarket into large sellers. Can you just talk about how that’s going? It seems like the GPV is currently about 50% of – from live sellers as of right now. What do you expect that to go over the next couple of years? What’s the opportunity you’re seeing? Thanks. Yes. I’ll take the first part of your question and then pass it over to Amrita for comments as well. But generally, we’re pretty excited about what we’re seeing with larger sellers. A big factor in this is our developer platform, making sure that larger businesses have access to our full speed of tools in the ecosystem and can custom fit it to their needs.
So if they just want to use a hardware, they can just use a hardware and then can integrate it to their own systems, whether it would be newer systems or legacy systems. We’re also pretty excited about the size of merchants that are utilizing our various services. So a Square Terminal seller, for instance, is annualized GPV is around 190k, registered seller is about 300k. Restaurant sellers, 650,00, so we’re reaching some larger folks.
One good example of this and for all of you New Yorkers is Joe & The Juice. They use Square in over 50 of their stores and they have a custom point of sale that was developed specifically for their business. They used our SDKs to make it work and to make it look good and to make it something that they don’t have to worry about.
So we’re reaching folks at scale, because our products scale from the smallest of sellers all the way up to the largest. And that’s really been our thesis is that, we want to build a system that enables a seller to grow and they never have to outgrow us and we want to support them along every path of that journey and that’s how we think about the broader roadmap. Hey, Steven, just to add to what Jack said, we do see ongoing momentum with larger sellers in the fourth quarter 51% of our GPV came from larger sellers. That GPV is up 39% year-over-year. And really, it’s driven by the products that we offer that continue to serve larger sellers.
And as Jack was saying, that cohesive ecosystem model that really focuses on omni-channel capabilities, because we can provide that all in one solution to manage the complexities of managed payments, multiple locations, employees and tracking many customers, that’s what’s really going to drive this growth.
And just to give you a couple data points around that. For omni-channel, 30% of our larger sellers sell through multiple channels with Square. And with that seamless integration that we can provide over 50% of larger sellers use two or more products and that’s obviously something that we can continue to grow.
Finally, self onboarding. Because of the friction with onboarding, we can offer over 80% of our larger sellers self onboard. So we’re going to continue to make progress there. Great, thanks. And I have a quick follow-up just around the banking license. I know you guys recently reapplied for one. Can you just talk about the timeline around it? And thanks, and welcome aboard, Amrita. Thank you, Steven. We don’t have any updates on the timeline. We’re working closely with the FDIC right now and Utah DFI, as they review our applications, and we’ll give you updates as soon as we have them Thanks, Steven. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey, great. Thanks, guys, and welcome Amrita. Maybe just to start with a margin question for you. I wanted to get some perspective. Just as we think conceptually beyond 2019, as you mentioned this year, we should see a similar amount of EBITDA margin expansion in the business as we did last year. What’s your view kind of more medium to long-term? I mean, is this the right zip code, 200, 250 basis points a year? Do you think there can be some acceleration in the rate of operating leverage as we look out further?
And then maybe just kind of unrelated, maybe this one is more for Jack, but just wanted to get a quick update on the non-U.S. markets, latest trends there and any plans to add more countries in 2019? Thanks. Hey, Jason, thanks. So with respect to your question on long-term margin expansion, we’re being very deliberate and purposeful in how we reinvest for growth and as ever continuing the financial discipline that Square has shown over the years. We’ve talked about a long-term margin goal of 35% to 40% at Investor Day and we continue to see strong underlying drivers and momentum in our business.
We have a massive opportunity in front of us to invest across our top three focus areas that you heard: omni-channel, financial Services and international, and we’re driving real results with margin expansion for each of the last five years, OpEx leverage of over 5 points in 2018.
So as we head into 2019, we’re going to continue to see margin expansion. And if we can continue to execute against our roadmap for delivering new products that scale, we will continue to see growth that can lead to margin expansion and operating leverage that can lead to margin expansion.
And finally, I’ll just say, we have confidence in our overall business model, positive dollar-based retention, continued payback period of three to four quarters, multiple monetization levers across sellers and individuals and an ability to flex levers across variable costs, whether that be sales and marketing or support. All of those things will – we believe continue to drive growth for us over the long-term in terms of margins. We have – Jason, so we have no immediate plans for new markets, mainly because the markets that we’re in are some of the biggest markets in the world and we see so much more opportunity to really strengthen them. One, in particular, for instance, is Japan. With everything happening around the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the market – and with the government pushing for more electronic payment adoption, we think that’s going to be a significant focus for us and something that we can see a lot of benefit from.
But I will remind everyone that one of the interesting things about the acquisition of Weebly was how global they were and how much insight that gave us into where we can make new moves and how we might open entirely new markets or just might deploy parts of the ecosystem that we would be able to move much faster than our in-person credit card terminals.
So we’re looking – we’re certainly learning as fast as we can and we’re taking all the information and prioritizing. But we believe there’s so much opportunity in the markets that we’re in that we’re going to continue to double down on them. Okay. Thanks for the comments, guys. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi. Your line is open. Thank you, and welcome, Amrita. Jack, I appreciate your comments on the power of the ecosystem. And I guess, if you look at a lot of your competitors out there, particularly these converged payment type of offerings that somewhat look like a Square. I mean, some pundits believe that there’s less stickiness in this type of solution, that it’s easy to switch from one seller solution to another. And now you’re starting to see increasing usage of interchange plus pricing. Do you view that as a threat? And how does Square think about competing against more competitive pricing and similar competing products? Yes. Thanks for the question, Pete. We – so we’ve seen this before and we’ve definitely seen much larger competitors come into our space with much more aggressive pricing than we were offering. And we did see a short-term kind of interest in what they’re doing and maybe some customers switching over. But after months, we saw those same customers switch back. And the reason why is the quality of our software, the simplicity, the pairing with our hardware and the broader ecosystem.
I think the – I believe the ecosystem is extremely sticky, because it builds durable relationships. If we’re just offering and we’re just focused on providing payments in the Register, certainly, there are so many other competitors out there. But when people come in for payments in the Register and then they use payroll or their restaurant and they use Caviar or these are marketing and really getting offers from Square Capital. It’s really hard to find that mix anywhere else and that builds durability.
So even if we see a decline in one particular part of the service, we still have a strong relationship with the rest of the services. So unlike a lot of our single focus competitors, a customer can fire them and it fires the entire company, whereas they may fire one of – one part of our ecosystem, but still use three other things.
So we think that adds a ton of resiliency, a ton of durability of the relationship, but it’s all a function of how well we continue to strengthen this and that’s our focus. Like, we know we’re building an ecosystem. We know that this is our core differentiator above all else and we benefit, not only from external customers, but internal customers, too, with our speed of development. That’s helpful commentary. And then I’d like to just follow-up on any developments with the new installments product. We get questions a lot about what is the – what percentage of volume is Square’s high-ticket it volume? And I realized an installment product would actually increase that over time. But would be helpful to see where we are in that development roadmap? Yes. We’re still pretty early on it, so we’re still testing a lot. We’re excited about it, because it does give – we launched it as – it looks like a customer benefit, but – and it is, but it’s really a seller tool, and the more they can offer their customers to enable them to be ready to purchase what they intend to purchase the more sales a seller makes.
So we think that is – we think that’s pretty critical and something that we want to continue to strengthen. But there’s a ton for us to learn right now, and we’re still playing with a bunch of the variables to make sure that we get it right. So that, our sellers, customers see it and they see the utility and signing up for it and that they’re really pushing on it. And Pete, just to add, in the third quarter – just going to add to that. In the third quarter, we saw $10 million transactions or installments on Square that were greater than $250. Thank you and welcome. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome, Amrita. I was wondering if you could maybe just pick up and provide a little more commentary on the long-term margin expansion outlook you provided earlier. Maybe tell us how you’re thinking about in the medium-term, obviously, it sounds like you want to invest to develop the biggest possible franchise, the revenue scale that the company can possibly get to. But how should we think about the balance of margin expansion? Specifically, are you solving for EBITDA growth, or are you solving for the largest potential revenue base and revenue working TAM? Thank you. Hey. James, thanks for the question. So what we’re focused on is driving growth on the top line and absolute dollar growth on the bottom line. Just to speak more a little bit about the track record that we have developed here around financial discipline, we’ve delivered margin expansion in each of the last five years. In 2018, at $257 million in EBITDA, up 85% year-over-year with 16% margins that was 5 points of OpEx leverage and 2 points of EBITDA margin growth/
And again, the track record of the things – the types of things that we’re investing in are driving results. We’re launching new products and we’re scaling new products. And those results have been remarkable in the last few years. I think, it’s important and worth underscoring, so that you understand how we think about this for the long-term reinvestment profile for the business.
Our new products launched in the last five years now account for 51% of adjusted revenue. That’s 15 points higher than where it was a year ago. We’ve built out an entirely new ecosystem with Cash App in the last few years, it’s now 15 million monthly active. That’s purposeful investment over a period of time that’s gotten us to this point now where we can scale and reach mainstream status.
And we deliver – we did all this, while also delivering, not only top line growth, but margin expansion in the business. So as we think about the long-term here, that’s what our focus is, continuing to put out great products and scaling them over time. And that ultimately will lead to absolute dollar growth. Thank you. And then maybe one for Jack. Could you maybe provide us any kind of updated metrics in terms of the traction your vertical specific software solutions are getting in terms of penetration of sellers, whether that be Square for Restaurants or Appointments, et cetera? Yes. So we – Square for Restaurants is definitely the bright star here. We learned a lot from that launch, mainly because we’ve really focused on getting as much feed book – feedback as we could from restaurants themselves. We had a bunch of workshops with restaurant owners and staff to make sure that we’re getting the flow exactly right. And it’s a great launch, but it is just a start.
We serve a very particular type of restaurant. We don’t serve all restaurant types right now, and we continue to learn how we can build the software. So that we can attract a larger and larger restaurant sellers as well and continue to look for ways to integrate Caviar.
We – in terms of retail, we had to do a bit of a reboot on just how we think about retail. We saw a lot of issues with the original interface and just have been rethinking a lot of that to make sure that we’re solving retailers’ needs and we’ve been applying the same things that we learned from restaurants into the retail space and appointments continues continues to thrive.
We want to make sure that we’re available on all platforms that we’re accessible to everyone who wants to use the app and then there’s deeper integration with the ecosystem as well. So generally, quite positive and they’re all really great starts. The one thing that I would point to in a metric standpoint for Restaurants, in particular, is that over 60% of our Square for Restaurants sellers self onboarding. That’s exactly what we want throughout all of the verticals.
We want to push as much as possible to self onboard. It’s easier for our sellers obviously much easier for us and then it speaks to the simplicity and elegance of our interface. So we have a very high bar set right now and we’re going to be applying across the other two verticals as well. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan from Mizuho. Your line is open. Hi, thanks, and welcome, Amrita to the team. I had a question on the Cash Card. Is there any metrics you can provide around the average balance that people are keeping in their Cash App? And maybe any trends there as they’re growing? And relatedly, is there any update on the Boost program and how that reward program might evolve over time? Yes. So we’re not disclosing the average balance that folks keep, but I will give you some other points. Like we are – so we are seeing mainstream adoption. we are seeing appeal with people aged 18 to 34. And that – one interesting thing we’re seeing is that, we’re seeing a lot more increased engagement through higher average transactions per customer and we’re increasingly seeing people using the Cash App as their primary spending tool.
And this is really interesting, because we do see people who are using the Cash App as their way to transact. And it starts with friends and family and moves onto the Square Card to the merchants that they go to all the time, where we have a direct deposit functionality where people can actually deposit their payroll right into it as well.
So we continue to add features that make us a first consideration, and in many cases, the primary tool as well. So we’re going to continue to build that out and strengthen even more. Excellent. And if I can have a quick follow-up on product development expenses and kind of trends there. You spent about 31% of revenue – adjusted revenue on product development and entered the year with 35% or so guidance for revenue growth, end of the year 53%, largely due to the returns you’ve got on the incremental product development expenses. And I just want to understand how you’re thinking about the return on those dollars spent?
So you had pretty – on an absolute dollar basis, you had about $600 million of incremental adjusted revenue this year, largely because you spend money creating products that people want. And it seems like the guidance implies you can have an additional incremental $600 million of revenues next year and this year in 2019 for maintaining similar levels of product development.
So I just want to make sure you’re thinking about that way in terms of getting the return on each incremental dollar spent on product development, you’re seeing the same returns looking forward, as you did in the past? Sorry, and before we get into that, I forgot your question on boost. We’re pretty excited about this program. We continue to add new merchants to it. We’re not aware of any other debit card program that enables instant cash back at favored merchants, and we think there’s a lot of potential, both for consumers and also our seller partners on it. And then, Tom, thanks for your question on product development. I urge you to look back at our track record here in the products that we’ve developed and scaled over the past five years, again, products over the last five years now accounting for 51% of adjusted revenue, up 15 points year-over-year, an entirely new cash ecosystem.
Where we’re going to continue to lean in from an investment perspective with product development is in driving velocity around launching and scaling new features. Top priorities, obviously omni-channel, verticals, developer, platform, Weebly, eCommerce integration.
From a financial services perspective, it’s continued growth on Cash App and Square Card and then obviously international will continue to scale as well. So, again, strong track record and will continue to execute against the long-term strategic priorities. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Buckingham. Your line is open. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and welcome, Amrita, as well. I’d like to ask about the growth in volume this quarter. It accelerated slightly sort of in line with estimates. But if I look at the mix by sellers, continued slowdown in the micro seller, the actual sequential acceleration in mid and large sellers picked up a little bit. So I was wondering if there’s anything macro that you’re seeing at that level in the micro sellers, or just the business is shifting away from micro, and that’s why you’re seeing a little bit slower growth there? Thanks. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. So yes, growth and volume, I’m assuming you’re talking about GPV there. We drove strong GPV growth at scale, up 28% in the quarter, up 30% year-over-year going from $65 billion in 2017 to $85 billion. We’re focused on serving all of our sellers. And many of the things that we’re doing in terms of products and services to serve larger sellers also matter for micro sellers and we’re very focused on that community as well.
I wouldn’t read too much into the specific mix of micro there, because there’s a lot of different ways that we can grow with micro. And some of the ways actually help the business grow and push them into the larger seller category. So there’s a little bit of mix going on and sellers moving between categories.
And also when we think about serving the micro channel, we’re micro sellers. We’re focused on, not only onboarding, but also growing with them, adding new products and services to the suite across that ecosystem, and 40% of our larger sellers started as micro. So if we can help them grow their business, we view that as success. That’s great. Thanks so much. And my follow-up would be the disclosure you have on Page 5 with the 30% omni-channel sellers sort of a very impressive number, and there’s a comment there is that 10% of your volume is coming from Virtual Terminal Invoices and eCommerce. Can you give us a sense of how much that is growing? I think there was a comment at one point a third of your volume potentially was card not present. So I just reconcile that 10% with the third being card not present from moving [indiscernible]? Thanks. Sorry, Chris, can you clarify the question? Yes. Just the – so the Virtual Terminal Invoices of eCommerce on Page 5 contributed 10 – more than 10% of Square’s GPV in the quarter. That’s a nice number to have. I also thought there was a prior comment that a third of your volume was card not present. So if it’s card not present, where does it go besides those Invoices and Virtual Terminal eCommerce API? I’m trying to get a sense of your eCommerce mix? Sure. This is an area that we continue to be focused on. I’m not sure I’d necessarily correlate those two different metrics together, but 10% volume though across Invoices, Virtual Terminal, eCommerce contributed more than 10% of our GPV in the fourth quarter and it is growing meaningfully over time. Okay. Actually, I was reading it wrong. It says more than 10% contribution in growth. Okay. And then any comment on eCommerce in terms of like the mix and health of your overall business? We’re – we acquired Weebly to strengthen us. And just an update on the integration, we’ve been working hard to make sure that we’re introducing Square sellers to the concept of Weebly and vice versa, focus a lot of the every day efforts on eCommerce and thinking about just the right opportunities to brand and to make sure that people see these as one thing, and that’s going to be our focus for the next few months. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you. Thank, Chris. Your final question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thank you very much and saying my thanks to you, Amrita, for internalizing so much of Square so quickly, it must been a lot of hard work in the last month or so. I wanted to ask a couple of quick questions. First on Square Capital, that came in a bit better than we had thought. And historically, we thought that there would be a bit more seasonality in that part of the business, but the originations were up sequentially.
So can you talk a little bit about what’s happening with who you’re extending credit to and under what circumstances? And if anything around the economics of that business have changed in the last year or so? And then I did want to follow-up on the ILC question. I know that you don’t have an update on timing. But Jack, have you gotten any early feedback from the regulators, et cetera, on the application? And have they left you with anything incremental to think about there? Thank you very much. Thanks, James, for the warm welcome. I’ll start off on your question on capital originations. Our core platform product continued to perform really well. We had 72,000 loans in the quarter, totaling $472 million, which was up 55% year-over-year. However, I think, it’s probably best to look at this business on a full-year or a trailing 12-month basis, because you do have some swings quarter-to-quarter.
So on a full-year basis, we had $1.6 billion, which was up 36% year-over-year and cumulatively have now facilitated $4 billion in loans across 650,000 loans and 230,000 sellers. We have not changed our criteria with respect to risk, not taking on incremental risk. And with this product, as you know, we have a long track record of sort of financial discipline, prudent risk management, we have short-term loans here, generally less than a year.
So that we have the ability to pivot quickly. We have a lot of data around the broader ecosystem around sellers to inform our models in real-time to manage risk. So we believe we have a differentiated product. But again, at the highest level, I’d look at the full year as opposed to any given quarter. James, unfortunately, I can’t talk about any ILC updates. But I will say, like we’ve enjoyed the process and the conversations and we look forward to more direct relationship with regulators. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. I’d like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call.

We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.
During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Good day, everyone. And thanks for joining us on our call today. I wanted to start off just by talking about some of the highlights from the quarter, and pass it off to Amrita for some of her comments.
So one quarter ended into 2019, what's been top of mind for me and us has been around ecosystem that we're building. This is our strongest competitive differentiator. It not only benefits our customers, wholesales and increasingly individuals with the Cash App, but also benefits our internal teams. For our internal teams, it allows us to move a whole lot faster. Some examples of this is because we had and built the e-commerce API, we're able to very quickly build virtual terminal and built to scale, and because we built the Cash Card that enabled us to build the Square Card to offer a similar offering for sellers.
This quarter, we re-launched Square for Retail with an applet model. This allows us to add features like invoices that were originally developed for Square point of sale, directly to Square for Retail. So generally, we’re going to continue to invest into this ecosystem. We do think it sets us apart from all of our peers and competitors in the industry, allows us to move faster and faster every single day.
We’ve been improving our tools for sellers to combine online and in person sales. We’ve been talking about omni-channel for quite some time. This quarter, we launched the new Square Online store. And we made it so that -- it has automatic syncing of both online and in-person data. So all of the sellers' items, orders, inventory and prices are synced automatically, which is another result of our ecosystem and using our internal tools to have much more impact and to move faster.
We’ve also been increasing our product velocity in our markets outside the United States; So Square Online store launched in Australia, Canada, the UK and the United States. Square Invoices launched in all of our markets at once. We want to see more of our products to do this. And Japan has been a very interesting story. I was in the country a few months ago. And we’re starting to see a lot more tailwinds within the market rather than headwinds.
There’s a few things fueling us. One, the government is working to double card payments, and they are pushing and incentivizing both consumers and also sellers to use more digital means of payments instead of paper cash. Two, we launched Square Stand and our Square contract person chip card reader in Japan. This is a huge upgrade from the reader that we had in the market in the past. It allows our sellers to automatically pay wirelessly or through a wire. It allows them to hold their iPad and hook it up to the new Square reader. And just as an overall better experience than we were providing in the market in the past.
And three, we have a new partnership with SMBC, which is distributing our readers in all of their bank branches around the country. So now any one of our Japanese sellers to be can go to the local bank branch, pick up a Square card reader and be in business. And it is that parity with what we offer in the United States and our other markets. This all combined with the fact that Japan is hosting the 2020 Olympics International Rugby League where you have a bunch of individuals from all around the world who are coming to the market, expecting to pay the way that they don’t have to usually with card or with a phone, makes it a perfect storm of situation where we can really see a potential for a lot of growth. So we’re really excited about Japan and our increased velocity in our markets outside the United States.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Amrita. Thanks Jack. I’d like to share three highlights this quarter; first, we continued to deliver strong revenue growth at scale; second, we continued to build out our seller ecosystem, including the launch of Square Invoices as a standalone app; and third, we’re raising revenue guidance for the full year 2019 on the basis of strong underlying trends across our business.
So first, driving growth at scale. The momentum across both our seller and cash app ecosystems drove total net revenue growth of 43% year-over-year or 39% excluding acquisitions and adjusted revenue growth of 59% year-over-year or 49% excluding acquisitions. Within our seller ecosystem, GPV from mid-market sellers grew 50% year-over-year. Mid-market sellers, which we define as those with over a half of million dollars in GPV, are now 24% of overall GPV, up from only 6% five years ago.
Within our Cash App ecosystem, we're seeing powerful network effects at play. We see strong growth in monthly active customers with Cash App consistently ranking as a top 20 overall app in the iOS app store, and we daily utility in Cash App. We also saw growth and engagement as measured by transaction frequency per active customer. With the compounding effects of growing reach and growing engagement practice, Cash App volumes grew nearly 2.5 times year-over-year.
Second, we continue to build out of seller ecosystem. The proof point this most recent quarter was the launch of Square Invoices as a standalone App. Invoices is a great example of investment in scaling, an important product to our sellers. This is a product that targets the large market opportunity with $1 trillion in consumer invoices in annually in the U.S. alone. We began Invoices five years ago as a feature in our dashboard. Then added it to the Square point of sale app. And now we have expanded the offering with a dedicated standalone mobile app. Invoices has reached impressive scale processing over $5 billion in GPV over the last 12 months with over 350,000 active sellers, and we see significant runway ahead.
Finally, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to reflect ongoing momentum in the business. We are raising our full year 2019 total net revenue by $60 million, and we're raising year adjusted revenue guidance by $30 million. This represents a 43% growth rate, an increase of 2 points compared to our prior guidance. The increase was primarily driven by outperformance in Cash App, as well as continued strengths across our seller business.
We're maintaining adjusted EBITDA guidance of $405 million to $415 million. We plan to use our momentum in delivering growth at scale to reinvest back into the business as we execute on our long-term opportunities of omni-channel, financial and international.
And I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. So I wanted to ask on the EBITDA upside this quarter versus your guidance. It looks like it was bigger than usual by our count and is bigger than the revenue upside belief as well. So can you detail a little more for us what fuel the upside to hurt Cash App and is there any more you can give us on that? And then also, again like you said, you're re-investing but holding EBITDA guidance, which makes sense. But where are you prioritizing your investments from here, I'm curious between consumer, and seller and something else you guys have going on, what's changing in your priorities as well? Thanks. So to explain what happened in Q1, our business is demonstrating success at scale across the portfolio. We had strong adjusted revenue growth of 59% in the first quarter and excluding M&A, 49% on an organic basis. This is driven by both the outperformance in Cash App, as well as broad strengths across seller business. I'll break it down in the revenue beat into the two component pieces, between transaction based profit and subscription and services. From a transaction based profit perspective, we grew 27% year-over-year in the first quarter based on the strength of the seller ecosystem.
We continue to see stable trends with positive revenue retention, a consistent three to four quarter payback period for new sellers and new cohorts to sellers increasing in adjusted revenue contribution. And we’re moving into even larger seller, as I just mentioned, GPV from mid-market sellers grew 50% year-over-year. From an SNS revenue standpoint, we doubled organically year-over-year with broad strengths. A couple of things to highlight there, in particular with Cash App. We drove outperformance. As you heard, volume grew nearly 2.5 times year-over-year, which highlights the continued growth in terms of reach and engagement on the platform.
As you heard last quarter from us, our monthly actives in December, 15 million monthly actives, was up more than 100% year-over-year. And we continue to see that growth in terms of strong monthly active growth with revenues outpacing growth in monthly active customers. Cash Card is an important piece of that. Cash Card drove higher engagement in the quarter. We saw rapid growth in Cash Card adoption within the customer base with increasing attach rates, and an increase in the frequency of usage per card active. We also saw strength with Square Capital with originations growing 50% year-over-year based on the core flex loan product.
And so for EBITDA, you saw the adjusted revenue beat flowing through the bottom line. We also had some timing of expenses in the quarter, which we now expect to materialize later in the year. And we plan to reinvest this upside back into the business for the remainder of the year. We’re optimizing for compelling reinvestment opportunities whenever they occur. And they’re based on when it’s the right time for our marketing and product development timeline to reinvest. So you’ll see that flow through in future quarters. Your question comes from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. I just want to touch again on the -- just given how strong subscription and services keeps holding up. Cash App volume, it’s good to see it was up 2.5 times. I mean I guess that’s showing the strength of the double end of users is showing better engagement. If you can just comment on how much of that doubling is actually being monetized. How many of those users are now being monetized so far? And how much does that contribute to cash app drivers contribute to subscription and services? And then if I could just add on. The business debit card, you touched on, Jack, before. I mean how has that been going so far? It seems like a good opportunity to add more revenue after a tough comp year from last year. Thanks guys. I’ll start off with your question on Cash App. You’re right. We saw strong growth in subscription and services in the quarter, doubling on an organic basis. With respect to Cash App, what we’re really focused on is driving a strong business model, which we’re seeing play out here through network effects, through engagement growth, all of which should lead to meaningful revenue growth. And we’re beginning to see that play out now in our financials.
The opportunity here is vast to enable access to financial services for the over 65 million of total in the U.S. alone that are unbanked or under-banked. And clearly, with our success consistently in the top 20s in the iOS app store, we’re achieving mainstream scale. So the way we think about the business model for Cash App is first driving reach. The network effects within the business and the frictionless on-boarding that the product teams have focused on have driven really efficient acquisition at scale. You've seen that play out with the doubling of the monthly active. You also see that in our financials. What we spend to acquire a monthly active is a fraction of what traditional financial institution spends, and that's inclusive of ongoing P2P costs.
From an engagement perspective with Cash App, we have talked about how the product velocity and the speed of mobile developing on the mobile platform has enhanced the daily utility of the app. Our teams have released Cash Card, boost direct deposit of currency, all within relatively recent time period. And another proof point of that daily utility is if you look in our filings, you'll see that we've tripled the amount of customer stored funds within Cash App. And that obviously Cash App volume is growing even faster than monthly active as we shared. Cash Card is a big part of this where we are driving engagement and higher life time values.
From a monetization standpoint, we have a number of business models in place today. As you know, instant deposit, Cash Card, cash for business, P2P funded through Credit Cards, cryptocurrency, but this is just the beginning. The hard part is the engagement and our team is nailing that. So as we launch more features, as we launch more services, as grow daily utility, we believe monetization will follow. On Square Card, just to remind everyone this is a card that we enable sellers to receive. And basically, it allows them to download the Square point of sale and give a place to store their money, and also a card that's Master Card branded that they can use anywhere. So basically, they don't have to make a trip to the bank to get into business, which is pretty cool. And one of the biggest reasons we did Square Card was to give our sellers faster access to their funds, has been a consistent team through our history. The faster we give access to funds, the more people can make smart decision about how to build their business. So it ultimately leads to these businesses growing overtime. So we found in our early pilot over 40% of Square Card sellers did not previously have a business debit card, so they are actually mixing their business funds for their shop with personal funds. So this also allows them to segment those funds.
The early read on this just one interesting metric that we can share is that active Square Card sellers are spending over 20% of their GPV through the card. So this is pretty excellent and a strong leading indicator that there is product market fit, and something that provides a lot of utility to get access to their funds to actually focus on what matters most, which is building the business. So we think there is a long run way here. As I said earlier in my opening, this is all based on Cash Card functionality and that system. So we have learned a ton through our Cash Card, and we expect to take all those learnings and make it better for our seller audience. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Ciancaglini, a Square Seller. Please go ahead, your line is open. It's Eric Ciancaglini, I am a Square seller. The name of my business is Chank's Pizza Cones. We actually serve pizza in a cone shape. And my question is -- so we use Square Payroll, and I'm also a Square shareholder. And I'm curious to know your strategy for adding payroll to the Square services. Was it mainly because you’ve seen ability to drive additional revenue through users that use Square Now, or are you focusing on capturing new users as more of a strategic move for bigger market share? We traditionally just look at what are the most critical needs for sellers and is there anything that we can build that would be differentiated in the market that’s bringing some new value. And with Payroll, we looked pretty deeply at a lot of time that was being spent just managing employees within each one of our sellers' shops. We already had an ability to use time cards within our register, and just about like a natural move to also figure out how to use that system to pay people as well. And it really speaks to something we want to do more of and see more of is, see a lot more overlap between the seller ecosystem and the individual ecosystem that we’re building with cash. So one of the things that we did for Payroll for instance is employees can be paid via the cash app. So we believe that’s extremely easy and fast way to get paid but also to utilize your money much faster as well for those employees.
So as we looked at the opportunity and that we saw where we could add some value, we decided to do it. But generally, that’s how we think about our strategy going forward is identifying real critical needs, where there are gaps within our ecosystem and then figure out what we can bring to the table that’s unique and differentiated and much stronger than what’s out there today. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Please go ahead, your line is open. I wanted to follow up on the seller card, sounds like nice product market fit with the stat you gave there. How should we think about the adoption curve? It seems like you have a very good channel to these sellers through the dashboard, email or otherwise. So it feels like the adoption curve to be fairly strong. So how should we think about that? And then secondly, when we think about the build with the Square pipeline, obviously, you have a really good relationship with Eventbrite where it's more of online gateway capacity. How should we think about the pipeline of opportunities there? So on Square card, I don’t believe we’ve done much in a way of traditional marketing or any push outside of the product itself. So we do think there’s a lot of opportunity to make it known that we are doing this. But right now, we’re making sure that the sellers that we see that would really benefit from it have access to it. So there’s a number of things we can do, both in terms of on boarding but also with sellers that are currently utilizing Square to surface this much higher. As I said, we just haven’t prioritized that yet, because we still want to make sure that the products feels really amazing, works provides utility and then really turn on the gas. So that’s where we are in the adoption curve, it's still early and we’re getting a lot of really great feedback from our sellers. I think it's one of our most well received launches in recent time, and something that we definitely exceeded our expectations and the results so far.
On build with square and Eventbrite, we see Eventbrite certainly as amazing partner but also a prototype of another marketplace. We have a marketplace within Caviar. We have marketplace within Eventbrite. And we do believe that we should be building within our developer platform more opportunities for marketplaces like Eventbrite. So we get to learn a lot from this partnership and that will need to more opportunities outside of any one company that any marketplace that exists can utilize our services. So that's ultimately the goal. The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. I was wondering if you can maybe you can comment on the further development and traction you're getting with your vertical specific software, specifically things like Square for restaurant. I think there was some anecdotal evidence that you have some competitive takeaways there. So maybe talk about how that is going, as well as the traction on your other more traditional retails solutions. Any metrics you can provide as an update on that front will be helpful. Thank you. So just backing up a little bit. When we think about vertical points of sales, we don't just run in ourselves to Square for retail and Square for restaurants. We have Invoices for example. We have Appointments. So this is a broader ecosystem of what we see in terms of vertical adoption. In the actual points of sales with restaurants and retail. Restaurants, we're pretty pleased with the adoption and what we're seeing. And one of the things that we believe is another one of our differentiators is how self-serve our system is and our ecosystem. And this has proven with restaurants, with 65% of restaurant sellers have self on-boarded, which is amazing, because it really de-taxes a bunch of work we might otherwise have to do with customer support or account management, or sales. So that's a great sign that we're building the technology in the right way. It's intuitive. People can figure it out and then get up and running.
You pair that with the average analyzed GPV of a restaurant seller, it's over 650,000. So we are reaching large restaurants and they are on-boarding themselves, so those two data points are excellent in our view. On the Square for retail side, as you've probably been following, we had to do a little bit of a reboot here. One of the things that we did well with Square for restaurants is we took a lot of time talking with restaurant owners and operators. And just really decomposed everything that they had to work with every single day, and what was frustrating them and how we could improve it. And that made a product that found in pretty product market fit right away. We did not do that with the original Square for Retail. So we rebooted the whole thing following that pattern, and we're seeing some equally good results from that move.
In contrast, about 85% of retail self onboard versus the 65% on restaurant, and nearly 40% of those sellers are new to Square, which is excellent. Average annualized GPV of Square for retail seller is nearly 250,000. So again, we continue to be attractive to the very small and the very large with the exact same software. And this is out of intent of wanting to build something that that scales from the very small to very large. I don’t know was that your whole question, or did I miss something? It was. Thank you, Jack. And then maybe one for Amrita. Just philosophically, as you approach the EBITDA guidance, I think you had previously talked about seeing similar margin improvement from a margin percentage basis as we saw last year. Obviously, you’re taking out the revenue but with EBITDA the same. So maybe -- I understand the timing of expense is part of it. But maybe just give us an update about how you’re philosophically thinking about the EBITDA margin piece of the equation? Thank you. Our financial priorities remain the same, which is driving long term top line growth and growth in absolute dollars of adjusted EBITDA. We have a number of levers in our business to achieve this. First, given the opportunity we see and given the efficiency of returns we see in the investment in our business, we’re being very deliberate in reinvesting into those opportunities. So in our ’19 guidance, you see that we’re leading with this. We’re maintaining our EBITDA guidance to 60% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, while raising guidance on revenue to 43%. We focused on financial discipline. We focused on operating excellence. And you’ve seen that play out with OpEx leverage in our business. And we expect overtime adjusted EBITDA growth to continue to outpace adjusted revenue growth as it has for each of the last five years.
Again, our reinvestment that we’re focused on includes investing into the cash app, which is historically we’ve been investing in and it’s bearing fruit in a meaningful way now, as well as investments in our salary ecosystem, which are driving growth. You’re seeing that play out with things like investments in hardware through Square Register and Terminal, investments in software and payments with virtual terminal and invoices and scaling launches of our more recent launches like Square card developer and online.
So ultimately, these investments are supported by a strong business model with positive attributes related to the efficiency of those investments and multiple monetization levers down the road across both seller and individual ecosystems. As a reminder, we ask the participants please limit themselves to one question and then return to the queue. The next question comes from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, your line is open. I have a question about the Square online store, phenomenal to see that launch this quarter, the re-launch of Weebly. Can you talk about when you’re looking -- a little more detail on that, when you’re looking at your seller base. Do you have a sense for what proportion of that base or candidates for adding the online store? How you’re going after them from a sales marketing perspective? And then also a little bit of a sense of how the economics of one of those sellers changes when they add the online store. I mean is it like a double of the type of revenue you’re seeing? Can you just dimensionalize that for us a little bit? Thank you. So we’re also pretty pleased with the launch of the Square online store. It does capture a lot of the intent and interest of the thesis we had with Weebly. The biggest underlying trend here is that we are seeing sellers all over want to optimize their sales for anywhere their customers are, so that is in person, that is online and also within mobile apps. So our strategy is to make sure that feels very fluid and they don’t really have to think about where their customers are coming from, which puts a lot of the emphasis on how the dashboard works and consolidates everything, how we sync data across all those channels. And we've tried to make it as effortless as possible and there is still some work to do there.
So far we have seen about 70% of Square online sellers have used Square before expanding online. And as we have seen generally when a seller does go online or an online seller goes offline, they do increase their sales and that is good. I don't have the exact metrics around what those look like. But we are making sure that, one, our seller know that this option is available, it's an easy flip of a switch. And if they want to do anything a little bit more custom or personalized to their business, they can utilize our API or our hire our developer to utilize the API. So marketing ideally starts within the products but we are going to continue to experiment and test as well. And, anything you want to say, Amrita, about economics? We know that 30% of larger sellers serve their customers via more than one channel on Square. So we are very focused on expanding our opportunities across going deeper within sellers and providing new ways that sellers can onboard. Your next question comes from Rayna Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open. [Technical difficulty] and if you can speak about some of the other markets you're interested in terms of… We didn't hear your full question, we got you at the end and it was very muted… Let me try again. What's your progress has been in some of your international markets, like the UK, Canada and Australia? And if you can also discuss some of the other markets you may be interested in entering? So I'll start there. One of the reasons Weebly was very interesting to is because they are operating in markets that we're not in, and that give us a lot more understanding and learning and to help us make better informed decisions about where to go next. Right now, we are so focused on making sure that we have more and more product parity with United States around all of our markets. So Japan is the most notable recent example of this where, as I said earlier, we do a lot of tailwinds now especially with the government incentivizing both consumers and also merchants to adopt digital money and move away from paper cash.
So we've been in that market for quite some time and this is first time we have seen that broad-based government support, as well as other events coming up that will put much more focus on Tokyo and also on paying with cards and also funds. So we're pretty pleased with that. And then in terms of more broadly, we’re working to make sure that we can launch more and more of our products in all of our markets Square Invoices, the app launch in all of our markets at once. So that’s what we want to see up a lot more of. And we continue to make progress around the world with the markets that we’re currently in, maybe Amrita can speak to some of the details? So as Jack mentioned, we are really focused on increasing our product velocity for launches outside of the U.S. And that really means completing our feature set, bringing what we've worked hard to build here in the U.S. to our international markets. Again, you’ve seen that more recently with the global launch for Invoices as a standalone app and 25% of Invoices downloads to-date actually come from outside of the U.S. You see that with the launch of the Square online store across the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia. And you see that with the hardware launches that Jack mentioned in Japan.
We see strong net promoter scores in most of our international markets anywhere from 60 to 80 across the UK Canada and Australia. And we’ve got ongoing brand campaigns in each of our international markets now. We launched a brand campaign in the UK and saw efficiency from that and now they’re reaching feature completeness across our portfolio. And some of the other markets, we're beginning to roll out those brand campaigns across the other international markets. Overall, it’s a large opportunity for us. We see $6 trillion in household spend across our current international markets, which is 2x what it is in the U.S. So we see a big opportunity ahead of us and we'll try to continue to execute. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. What I wanted to ask is Square moved up to market to the mid to large clients. I assume Square is likely replacing incumbents. So curious on what’s winning versus the competition? Is it all just the omni-solution you guys can provide? And just thinking do you guys have enough in the sales channels to go after that larger market? Thanks. So we continue to see the larger sellers find value and utility in our base offerings. So we built products with intent of the same software scaling from very small to very large, and that continue to resonate even with larger sellers. And we continue to see larger sellers self on board. We continue to see them take advantage of the broader ecosystem. So all these things combine towards what differentiates us from our competitors. But if I only had to pick one it would be the ecosystem. And just like all the tools in one place and how quickly we’re moving to add new tools or to improve them.
We continue to see large sellers also utilize our API in significant ways. This has been a very strong offering for larger sellers, because can hook up legacy systems and can also customize an entire point of sale, but still use our hardware, which you can’t find at any of our peers. And then I’ll pass it over to you Amrita. I’ll add to Jack’s comments. We’re focused, as he said, on building products that serve large sellers, whether you look at our hardware products like Square Terminal or Square Register, both of which over index to lager sellers' Square Terminal with $165,000 GPV registered with $300,000 GPV, or the developer platform, as Jack mentioned, which over indexes to mid market sellers and then the verticals, which Jack had earlier mentioned, over indexing the larger sellers.
We are also trying to reach sellers from a marketing standpoint. So we have got products that address larger sellers and small sellers and then we want to reach from a marketing perspective these larger sellers. So just in April this last month, we launched a new ecosystem marketing campaign, reaching 7 million small and medium size businesses across the U.S., focused on expanding awareness of the full breadth and ecosystem of products that Jack was referring to. We know that over 50% of larger sellers already use two or more of our products. So we are focused on continuing to grow that through this ecosystem marketing campaigning and continue to build out strong products that address this market. Your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. I wanted to ask again about online, your online strategy. Obviously, your advantage in terms of linking online and offline sales for retailers and get that that's what makes Square online store compelling. Can you do something similar at other platforms, like WooCommerce or Magento, or Shopify those types of commerce platforms? I mean is there a bigger e-commerce like omni-channel addressable market that you can go after by opening up and working to integrate online and offline through those folks? We have focused more on omni-channel rather than just pure e-commerce, because that's really where our sweet spot is with sellers. But you can imagine us favoring one more in the future given how much activity is happening with e-commerce. So all this is going into our strategy around the developer platform. We want to make sure that we are testing the very small but also the very large. Eventbrite is a good example of the very large where we are testing a marketplaces strategy on top of the developer platform. So we do believe that there is a ton of room here. And we just want to make sure that we are optimizing for the best experience first. We don't believe that we need to be first to market to win customers. We just have to provide something that really adds differentiated value to the marketplace and that's where our focus and that's what we're proven now. Your next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open. The purchase volume, while very impressive at 27% growth, has decelerated somewhat. And there are -- you've certainly waken up a lot of competitors in this space, Jack and investing more heavily to compete with Square. Are you seeing more competition, whether it's -- and I know you've built the ecosystem and others are trying to build something similar to that. But are you seeing more competition, whether it's from Clover or TSYS or other merchant acquirers or fintech companies? We are definitely seeing competition on the edges. We have a lot of firms out there that are making solution around payments, around payroll, around delivery, around everything that we see, P2P or whatnot. But again, I think it really comes back to this concept of ecosystem and how all these things tie together. And we have built I think fundamentally model within the finance that we benefit a lot from. And we do expect people to copy aspects of this. But we want to make sure that we're focused on being the best author and really focusing on the quality of the experience, the elegance, the fact that it has entered this so it’s self served that it work seamlessly with all tools that we provide and also third party tools and that continues to win. But we do expect competition on the dynamic. But I think we've pretty good and proven track record of being able to scale that and something that is meaningful, both for sellers, individuals and also us. And Bob, just on your GPV point just to give you a little bit of context there. So in the first quarter, GPV was $23 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Over the trailing four quarters, we had approximately $90 billion of GPV. What we’re seeing drive growth there -- outsize growth is a couple of things. First, larger sellers, which we’ve been talking about, we see continued strength there. Over half of our GPV mix now comes from larger sellers and mid-market sellers as we shared is growing 50%, or grew 50% year-over-year in the first quarter.
We have multiple levers of growth within scaling our new payment channels. A couple of examples of that, Invoices, as we discussed. $5 million in GPV over the training four quarters is growing much faster versus the blended overall GPV rate; and some of the products that Jack was referencing developer, verticals, online, these are all relatively younger products and they’re growing meaningfully faster. So we’re going to continue to push them. But GPV is only one measure of the value that we provide our sellers. When we think about the ecosystem, we think about adjusted revenue, which is how we measure our business and how we incent our teams to grow. And again, adjusted revenue grew 59% year-over-year, which captures we think the full breadth and value of the ecosystem beyond just payments, including also subscription and services. Your next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. The transaction cost as a percentage of GPV was a little better than what we had anticipated. And conversely the profit dollars associated with that, profit margin was also better. The question I really have is, is there something that’s happening as a result of Cash App or Cash Card that it changing this funding mix, so to speak, as we think about that? And if so, is this trend something we should be tracking little more closely like commensurate with the Cash App growth? Thanks. No. Cash App, you should think of it separately from transaction costs. As a reminder, both GPV and transaction and profit growth exclude cash app. Separately as you’ve heard us say, Cash App has continued to outperform and drove revenues for us and for the overall business with volumes up 2.5 times nearly year-over-year. But I would think of that separately from transaction costs perspective. And that’s true for Cash Card as well? That’s right. Your next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. This will be the last question. Jack, I wanted to ask an industry question of you. We have seen obviously a move to consolidate some of the up market merchant acquirers and participants in the market. And I know in the past, you have indicated that you didn't feel like you could achieve everything you wanted to if you are part of a bigger organization. But I'm wondering how you are thinking about consolidation and if that make sense for Square to be looking at doing something similar, or it's on M&A activity et cetera in this space? Or do you prefer still very much an organic approach to the market? Well, a bit of both, if I'm understanding your question correctly. We do see that others are consolidating and acquiring. But they do so in a fairly typical pattern that we resisted, which is look at just the parts of the equation instead of building a greater ecosystem. So we do have a significant M&A strategy in terms of looking for really great teams, really great products. And if we determine that they will help the ecosystem or add a new potential solution that a seller is facing in a critical way or an individual within Cash App is facing in a critical way that we will acquire it.
We tend to do much smaller ones than our peers because we've managed to find really great teams that every single person in the organization has really high impact, and that's what we want to optimize for ultimately. But it comes down to -- we're constantly looking at the rising of what companies are out there, start-ups, current companies and making decisions based on what we see and the quality of the people, the quality of the work, quality of the product. We haven't historically taken a position of just buying revenue or buying customers. We want to buy technology and that is what we're focused on. So I do think we will continue to see consolidation, but that doesn't worry me.
What I want to push on is we continue to enrich our ecosystem and make it stronger and stronger, and stronger. By doing so we add resilience, we add the durability, we hired for multiple jobs by seller, by an individual rather than just be dependent upon one. So all of these things are what we want to drive and M&A is certainly a channel to do so. I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.

And welcome to the Square Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.
During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants. In addition to our shareholder letter we have filed a press release announcing our definitive agreement to sell Caviar, our food ordering platform to DoorDash. This transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason. Hello, everyone. A few remarks from me before we turn it over to Amrita for some details and then your questions. So we’ve been able to accomplish something very few companies have, the creation of not just one, but two incredible customer ecosystems at scale. We started the company by creating and building a seller ecosystem. We did it again this time for individuals with the Cash App. Along the way, we’ve seen a lot of opportunity to strengthen both of these ecosystems, but those opportunities require more focus and more investment. To increase our focus, we decided to sell our Caviar business to DoorDash. This enables us to focus on serving restaurant and food sellers through a platform approach, specifically our orders API and Square for Restaurants.
DoorDash was an obvious choice for us because of our pre-existing partnership through orders API and Cash App. Both companies have an alignment of interest to strengthen our partnership. This decision will also allow us to increase our investment, specifically in seller. Our initial focus will be on go-to-market investment, inclusive of hardware and sales and marketing. Given our payback periods and ROIs for multiple products within the seller ecosystem, we see compelling opportunities for more growth.
The Cash App ecosystem continues to exceed our expectations. In just three years, Cash App revenue performed basically $0 million to $135 million, excluding Bitcoin. We love you, Bitcoin. And we saw 3.5 million customers use Cash Card in June, typically using it to purchase multiple times per week. Our seller and Cash App ecosystems have incredible roadmaps ahead to deliver on our purpose of economic empowerment. And every time we tighten our focus, we get stronger. These moves will enable us to move faster and much better.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Amrita for some details. Thanks, Jack. There are four key highlights, which I’d like to call out this quarter. First, we continue to drive impressive revenue growth at scale. Second, we continue to see strong returns on sales and marketing spend and see further opportunity to invest at attractive returns in our seller ecosystem. Third, Cash App has grown rapidly and is now a meaningful contributor to our overall revenue. Fourth, we believe the transaction to sell Caviar will improve our focus and drive greater investment in our seller and cash ecosystems.
Let’s expand on these points a bit. First, we drove strong revenue growth at scale. Total net revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted revenue grew 46% year-over-year to $563 million. We saw broad-based momentum across both seller and Cash App ecosystems driving our results. As a reminder, we lapped a few events, which drove the tougher comp on revenue growth this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2019. We lapped the acquisitions of Weebly and Zesty, which closed in the second quarter of 2018. These acquisitions contributed two points to total net revenue growth and three points to adjusted revenue growth in the quarter. And we also lapped the pricing change on Cash App and Instant Deposit.
Second, in our seller business, we continue to generate strong return on investments from sales and marketing, with further opportunity to scale at attractive returns. We’ve seen payback period trend towards three quarters with continued positive revenue retention. This results in a 3x to 4x return on investment for a new seller cohort within three years of onboarding. In April, we launched a marketing campaign to increase brand awareness for Square’s ecosystem of products to help sellers manage and grow their business. We are encouraged by early returns from this campaign, including improved top-of-funnel metrics around awareness, which has led to growth in sign-ups.
Third, our Cash App ecosystem has driven meaningful monetization and attractive unit economics. We see strong momentum and durability across three key vectors, the network, engagement and monetization. Cash App delivered $135 million in quarterly revenue, excluding Bitcoin. While we are improving the efficiency of our cash ecosystem, we continue to invest given the rapid growth of the platform and compelling unit economics. What we see is, one, low and stable acquisition costs for new customers, even as we scale in the mainstream populations; and two, greater engagement and monetization for active customers across multiple revenue streams, driven by increased attach rates on key products that provide daily utility, and as we launch new features, we see further opportunities to cross-sell into large and growing – into our large and growing customer base with minimal incremental acquisition costs.
Finally, we have entered into an agreement to sell Caviar, which will allow for improved focus and greater investment in our seller and cash ecosystem where we have seen attractive returns. With the pending sale of Caviar, we are maintaining our full year 2019 guidance for 43% adjusted revenue growth year-over-year and 60% adjusted EBITDA growth year-over-year at the midpoints.
We will update our guidance after the close of the transaction. Similar to prior quarters, we intend to reinvest outperformance back into the business to capture the long-term opportunities ahead of us. We expect most of our incremental seller ecosystem sales and marketing expenses to land in Q3 and the early part of Q4 when we know businesses make decisions and spend can be more effective prior to the holidays. We expect these investments to benefit us and drive growth in the future.
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Listen, I just want to start off on the Cash App, just to get more data points around how much is being monetized, and maybe start off if you could help us understand the curve and the maturity of that monetization? Is it 20 – I mean you talked about Cash Card being about 23% of the actual Cash App users, where is that? Is that something that could be much higher from here? And then maybe you can help us understand the breakdown of revenue across the Cash App between the different sources you highlighted, whether it’s the Cash Card or others? Clearly, it seems like it’s growing well, just curious how much room it has. Thanks guys. Thanks so much for the question. So we are very pleased with the performance that we’ve seen from the Cash App team. Their focused, first and foremost, on growing the network and growing engagement and daily utility on Cash App, and we believe and we’ve seen that lead to monetization. And Cash App has scaled from negligible revenues three years ago to now an annualized rate of over $0.5 billion in revenues. So we can unpack that a little bit for you. I think you were asking specifically about how the opportunities with Cash Card and the ability to grow that attach rate in those revenue is associated with Cash Card over time. Maybe if you take it back one step and look at overall monetization for Cash App, two years ago, when we were very early in the life of monetization of Cash App, we disclosed, I think, this is in the second quarter of 2017, that over one third of users monetize. And that was pre-Cash Card.
Now we’ve seen significant growth in that number with the addition of these new monetization and engagement levers like Cash Card, like Bitcoin and a number of other levers. With Cash Card, in particular, we disclosed the 3.5 million actives. We continue to see growing attach rate for Cash Card from period to period, and we think we’re in the early days of that. We’re also seeing really strong metrics around usage and engagement with multiple transactions in a given week for everyday purchases. So this is a really great proof point for us around customer engagement and driving retention and opportunities for cross-sell into this large and growing audience into the future.
In terms of just – I think the last part of your question was around breaking down revenues for Cash App. We have half a dozen revenue streams and we believe that we are in the very early days of that. The two biggest around Instant Deposit and Cash Card, and we’ve got four other growing revenue streams. And given we’re in the early days and this team has demonstrated strong product velocity, we envision many more into the future. All right. Thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Hi, I just want to ask about Caviar, if we could get any sense of revenue or EBITDA. I’m guessing the EBITDA margin for Caviar is lower than the overall company average. So I’m trying to think about that and maybe the growth rate of those – of revenue and EBITDA, how fast is it growing? And then if we’re going to reinvest those proceeds, where exactly inside of Cash App are we thinking about reinvesting those? Thanks so much. Thanks for the question, Bryan. So let me help you break it down a little bit on Caviar. We’ll be able to share a lot more with the relevant financial statements, including and excluding Caviar, upon the close of the transaction expected to happen later this year. But just to give you a little bit of boundaries as you kind of model the business. From a revenue scale perspective, Caviar is the second largest component of our subscription and services revenue stream where we did $251 million in revenue in the second quarter. We’ve now disclosed key revenues for Cash App, which was the number one driver of our subscription and services revenue stream. Capital is the third. So you can kind of benchmark within there, backing into a figure within range for Caviar.
From a margin perspective, as a delivery platform, Caviar has lower gross margin profile than the remainder of our revenue streams related to subscription and services. There are ongoing costs associated with Caviar, including fees for couriers and the revenue share with restaurants that have made it the largest component of subscription and services-based cost. But again, we will update you on – in the future upon the closing of the transaction on further details there. And in terms of the reinvestment of proceeds, you mentioned Cash App. Cash App is pretty amazing network effect right now, and we benefit a lot from them. So a lot of our focus, as we think about these two ecosystems between seller and cash, is going to be on go-to-market and seller. We think there’s a lot of opportunity based on our payback periods and return on investment within multiple products within the seller ecosystem. And that will be inclusive of hardware, but also more we can do with sales and marketing. So as we’ve been looking at the business and looking at a new world where we do have the ability to focus on just two ecosystems instead of three, we’re really compelled by a number of the opportunities on the seller side and continuing to build out more and more of the Cash App roadmap, which continues to address some critical needs the people have in accessing the financial system. All right. Very helpful. Thanks guys. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on GPV and your plans to invest more in the seller ecosystem like you just said. I know GPV growth in percentage terms gets a lot of attention, but you’re still adding a record notional amount of GPV, if I’m doing the math right. So my question is do you feel confident that you can keep adding whether five billion on volume a quarter and can that actually accelerate with the seller ecosystem investments that you’re talking about? Thanks. Thanks for the question Tien-Tsin. We are focused with these investments on driving both top of funnel through awareness and activations, along with cross-sell across the ecosystem. GPV picks up one piece of one ecosystem. It picks up primarily a payment piece of the seller ecosystem. Keep in mind, as people think about GPV, that we don’t include things like Cash App GPV in the figure, and we also don’t include the other revenue streams around subscription and services as a part of GPV, which is why we, as a company, manage the business to our revenues and we think about revenue growth when we’re driving investments.
Revenue grew 46% in the quarter and that fully – adjusted revenue grew 46% in the quarter to $563 million. That really captures the full breadth and value of the ecosystem. Within GPV, some of the pockets of growth that we’ve seen that we’re very encouraged by include around our larger sellers who now are more than half of our GPV mix. Mid-market sellers, which are the largest sellers that we serve with over $0.5 million of GPV, also grew and actually grew at the fastest rate, which is 45% year-over-year. And we believe we have multiple levers of growth ahead on GPV, including across the rest of the business. And a lot of that is related to some of the newer payment channels that we have developed that are growing faster than the base GPV amount. So think about things like our vertical point-of-sale offerings around retail and restaurants or developer platform in omnichannel products. But again, I would anchor you to thinking about the overall revenue growth for our business is that captures the breadth of offerings that we have for our sellers and individual customers. Got it. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Nomura. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick housekeeping question. The Eventbrite, is that included in GPV for this quarter? Thanks for the question Dan. Eventbrite is still in testing phase, so I wouldn’t think of that as a material contributor to GPV in the second quarter. We are hard at work on building out a long-term solution, omnichannel solution for Eventbrite and expect to launch in the back half of this year. Got it. Maybe a question for you and maybe for Jack, too. I mean, we’ve been getting – we’ve been doing a lot of work on the Cash App and the ecosystem, but can you maybe give us like one concrete example, Jack, of how the ecosystem kind of helps you get both sides of the transaction, both the sellers and the consumers, which I believe is sort of the holy grail of this whole thing? I agree with you. We do see a lot of opportunity there. Like, so our first focus is to build the individual ecosystems, the seller ecosystem and the Cash App ecosystem. There’s a lot of strength, and both ecosystems are addressing critical needs. So within seller, it’s payments and register and capital and appointments, and Square for restaurants and Square for retail and whatnot. On the developer platform, on the cash side, it’s everything from peer-to-peer to the Cash Card to Bitcoin to Instant Deposit to a host of other services that help people on a daily basis, like Direct Deposit as well. So we have seen some crossover between these two ecosystems, and we do think that there’s a lot of power in connecting them. We have been paying some of our payroll customers through the Cash App, which is beneficial to both the seller and the Cash App ecosystem.
Some time ago, we started paying Caviar couriers through the Cash App, which is beneficial to Caviar and soon to be the DoorDash ecosystem and also the Cash App ecosystem. And we have been doing more and more consideration around Boost as well and where that fits in to that ecosystem as well. So we do believe there’s a ton of connections between these two. And some of this focused investment, we’ll definitely be answering that question, making those connections much, much stronger. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey guys. So you did, as we’ve become accustomed to seeing, you did beat the high end of the revenue guidance for the second quarter here. Now typically, historically, that’s been accompanied by a raise in your annual revenue guidance. We did not see that this quarter, so I just wanted to get an understanding of what the thought process is around the second half and where you may have a little bit of uncertainty/caution perhaps that might have led you to decide to not change the full year outlook despite another very strong quarterly performance. Hey Jason, thanks for the question. Hey, Amrita. So, with respect to the revenue raise, I'd urge you to remember that this quarter, we've announced the transaction with Caviar. And so we will update you post the closing of this transaction, which we’d expect to happen later this year, with respect to guidance for the rest of the year. Also remember, we raised guidance last quarter by $30 million or two points of growth, which was obviously more than the beat that we had last quarter. And finally, recall that, of course, we're driving growth for the long term. And so the investments that we're making in the back half of this year, we expect to drive growth for us into the future. Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Thank you for taking my question. Jack, can you – I appreciate the refocus into the core ecosystem here, but can you give us a sense, at least, the competition seems to be getting tougher with other cloud POS players, but on the seller side. Is this more of a response to things like that? And perhaps maybe you can at least qualitatively give us a sense of how retention is holding up in the seller channel? Thank you. Yes. I’ll take the first part and Rita will answer the second. We – I mean, really, this is not looking externally, this is looking internally. We just see a ton of opportunity based on our – the strength of our payback periods and the return on investment of multiple products within the seller ecosystem particularly. And we think just doing some small things like a focus on go-to-market through hardware and also through sales and marketing will have very, very good outcomes. So we want to pull the thread on that. And we do believe that the thing that still sets us apart from all of our competitors is the cohesiveness of our ecosystem. The fact that I can come in for one tool and see an array of other tools that will help with your second question, which is around retention. We do have a number of sellers who use multiple products at once and find the ability to just download one app and, suddenly, you have an entire universe of tools to solve all the critical needs that one would have right there. It's very compelling, very easy and very fast and something that continues to be a competitive differentiator for us.
So, we now get the opportunity to really focus on these two ecosystems, and we see a lot of opportunity within seller. We continue to beat our expectations within cash. Both ecosystems have some incredible roadmaps ahead, and especially for this year, which I'm really excited about, which bring both to a significant strength. But as the previous caller indicated, we think there's even more opportunity in connecting the two and having a positive reinforcement cycle between those two ecosystems. So this really allows us to focus on two critical constituencies that, I think, strengthens both ecosystems and adds a lot of value to the company. And Pete, I’ll just add to the retention point. The last time we shared a full deep dive with you about our seller business back at our Investor Day two years ago, we talked a lot about paybacks and ROI and retention. And if you look at how the business has evolved since then, the dynamics in our seller ecosystem remain largely the same or better. We talked about paybacks at that time in the four-quarter range. We’re now seeing them trend to the three-quarter range. We see return on investment that is also at very significant levels. We see positive revenue retention for our existing cohorts. We see new cohorts joining at higher revenue levels.
All of these drivers have led to our seller ecosystem driving a very attractive profitability profile even as the business has scaled. And it’s because of that scaled level of profitability, it’s because of the strong unit economics, it’s because of the strong ROIs that we have the confidence to invest in this business in the back half of this year and into next year. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. With respect to the investments you plan on making on the seller ecosystem, can you maybe just give us a little bit of color about the dimensionality of that in terms of how much of this is about going after new sellers and adding to the total number of sellers, especially larger sellers, and how much of that is about kind of extending the ancillary product offerings and additional subscriptions and services to the existing base? So, the way we think about this is building one tool for all types of sellers, all sizes of sellers. We want to make sure that we’re enabling the seller who’s just getting started on their houseboat, all the way up to a seller with 40 locations to be able to sell within the ecosystem. So our focus right now is going to be on hardware sales and marketing, and that will be continuing to reach out to the very small and the very large. And of course, we’re going to balance that with making our product better and better. A big focus for us right now is on the developers platform and the API. We continue to see a lot of benefit from taking a platform approach. This is especially true as we move Caviar to DoorDash. As DoorDash succeeds, we also succeed and our restaurants succeed by using the orders API and the orders hub, the orders manager at their restaurants. So this is something that we feel very confident in. And Jim, just to add to that, some of the sales and marketing efforts that we’ve already seen this year have delivered positive traction. So as an example, our brand marketing campaign in April reached 7 million sellers. And while it’s still early, that positive early traction delivered top-of-funnel metrics like awareness and conversion for new sellers that we’re really encouraged by. When we look at other markets, where we’ve invested in this way with brand awareness in our international markets, those brand awareness campaigns have actually driven greater efficiency in our direct performance marketing spend as well. So I think as Jack mentioned, you’ll see us lean in on areas like hardware, top of funnel, brand awareness as well as some of the direct performance-related marketing to drive the full ecosystem here. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Candace Cox with Candid Art. Hello, I am a Square seller and my business is CANDIDART from Oakland, California. And my question is, will Square ever offer some classes specific to entrepreneurs that business owners can attend? That is a great idea. We – and also, thanks for using Square. We have actually started a program called Self-Made, which is a series of free night schools, and the first editions were in Atlanta and Pittsburgh. And we do believe we’re going to bring this series to Oakland in 2020. So next year, we should have some classes for you on social media marketing, setting up a website, online store and everything you need to start and run and grow your business. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about omnichannel, this has been a boost for you since the Weebly acquisition. But it’s also a fiercely competitive market, and many of your peers, whose business is primarily e-com are now moving in store. So, can you talk about the competitive differentiators in online? How it has evolved? And how is Weebly fitting in there? Yes. So, we believe that omnichannel is a big strategic value for us and something that we want to continue to invest in and grow. We believe this because we do have a lot of our sellers offline and online who either want to sell online, or for a lot of online businesses, they’re considering more experimental ways of selling like pop-up shops and physical retail. So we want to make sure that we’re a place where you can come to, you can download an app, open the service up and everything you need is right there. I think what differentiates us is it’s not just about e-commerce, it’s about all these channels, including mobile, so that a seller can bring all the channels together from offline, mobile and online in one place, in one dashboard, and have all the suite of other tools that we offer, including appointments, capital, customer relationship, management, everything needed to really grow the business, not just to make sales, but to actually grow the business and provide insights into it. And that’s what we want to continue to strengthen. And we see a lot of opportunity in continuing to invest and increasing our investment around online store omnichannel in the form of sales and marketing, which will complement everything that we’re doing around hardware and hardware sales as well. So we do think there’s a lot more room for us here. Hence, why the moves today were so important and we’ll benefit so much from. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Thank you very much. You guys have talked about increased marketing and efforts, and obviously, a lot of that has been dedicated to Cash App and expansion of services. But wondering if you can talk about the campaigns that you launched in the U.K. last year and how effective that was and how you’re looking at expanding marketing efforts international – to the international markets you’ve identified versus in the U.S.? Thanks. Yes. So, in UK, this continues to be a focus for us and we want to make sure that we have a remarkable product within the market. We have been investing in brand campaigns in the UK, and this has driven efficient customer acquisition with the costs to acquire new seller down by over 50% compared to prior year. So we are learning as quickly as possible. And as you know, we are not first to the market in the UK, but we strive to be the best, and we strive to continue to bring more and more of our ecosystem to the market. We’ve managed to launch multiple products at once within the UK, which was a huge milestone for us. And we continue to look for opportunities to showcase the uniqueness of the UK market and everything that’s happening within the UK through marketing and also through our media, which continues to create a flywheel where more and more people are aware of Square and utilizing it. And just to – James, to add on the international expansion part of your question, our approach to international markets is, step 1, make sure that we have a full suite of products and fill in any gaps that we have a full suite of products and fill in any gaps that we see there; step 2, to drive brand awareness campaign so that people understand Square and the full breadth of our ecosystem; and step 3, to drive greater performance media to drive conversion. So we’re still in that ramp. But with some of the product offerings that we released earlier this year and with things to come, you’ll see us continue to fill in product gaps internationally, have a full suite of offerings internationally and lean in, therefore, to sales and marketing increasingly. Thanks very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your distribution model in international markets and how it’s evolving. Are you – does it look and smell different in these different markets? Is it more partnerships in some and more direct sales in other? And just a quick bolt-on to that question, I was just wondering if the Q3 guidance was impacted by any changes in your expectations around when Eventbrite would roll out? Thanks for the question. So, I think, every market is going to be unique. And Japan is a really good example of this where we feel very confident now in our success in the country, because we have a lot of tailwinds from the government, who is providing subsidies for both sellers and buyers to shift to digital and card payments. We have a number of events coming up in Tokyo that bolster the number of global travelers into Tokyo. We’re expecting to use cards at every merchant that they go to within the city and within the country. So that does require a very different approach from what we have seen in the UK and what we’ve seen in Australia. So, each one is going to be slightly different. And we have folks on the ground who are aware of what the best channels are within each market. And in some cases, it is more direct sale, in some cases, it is more partnerships. So we just want to be flexible and agile as we approach every market. And Ramsey, with respect to your question on guidance, it does contemplate the beginning of the ramp up and the rollout of Eventbrite in the back half of the year. Okay. Thanks so much. Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the net transaction yield that came in a little bit lower than what we were looking for and down a little bit year-over-year, is that as simple as the mix toward larger merchant? Or is there anything else we should be thinking about in the quarter and going forward? Hey, George. Yes, you got it. Transaction margin was 1.06% of GPV in the second quarter, which is down two basis points year-over-year. It was as expected. We discussed this back at last quarter that we expect transaction margins to come down slightly throughout the year as we continue to grow with larger sellers. And because of that, transaction margins are not a metric we use in isolation to measure success. We really orient again towards revenue and absolute dollars of revenue along with these efficiency metrics that we look at, overall payback periods, revenue retention, et cetera, which help us focus on the growth of the overall ecosystem along with cross-sell opportunities. Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up from me on the sales and marketing investments and the seller ecosystem. As you move upmarket, and as you called out, an increasing amount of your business is coming from greater than 500,000 or the 125,000 to 500,000, a lot of the competitors in that space heavily use channels like direct sales or ISVs or bank channels. As you’re investing in your go-to-market model up there, how do you think about some of those channels, like what’s sort of Square’s view on your go-to-market strategy, your channel strategy in the upper market? Thank you. So, when you say upmarket, do you mean larger sellers? Just to be clear. Yes. Larger sellers, like greater than 500,000 or even in upper end of 125,000 to 500,000. Yes. So, we have a – we’ve seen a pretty unique dynamic. I’ll just point you to Square for Restaurants and Square for Retail, where we saw that it is attracting a number of larger sellers. And what’s interesting and really compelling is that the majority of them, over 70%, 80%, are self-serving into the app and into the service. So, self-service is important because it means that we have enabled people to – we’ve built an intuitive interface where they don’t need a call, where they don’t need help and they can just go right away. And if we can make larger sellers approach Square as smaller sellers do, who just go to the App Store and get it done, that’s a really scalable model. And then sales and marketing and a lot of our account management really becomes an opportunity for us to cross-sell and to show other tools within the ecosystem that, that seller can use. So, we benefited a lot from just having a really fast, easy, elegant and accessible product that a seller of any size can utilize. And we will always be open to other models, but we have – we think we have a lot of room to strengthen the one that we have. And Lisa, just to add to that in particular, when we look at our sales approach, looking at our sellers’ sales and marketing spend, we see strong returns and an opportunity to invest efficiently. Our sales and account management teams has had high returns on investment comparable to the overall return that we’ve already shared with you on sales and marketing, which is already attractive. So we know that this team is often touching upmarket sellers, those larger sellers, and sometimes have higher acquisition costs, but because of the higher lifetime value of those customers, we see strong returns on those investments with our sales team and an opportunity to invest further. Terrific, thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I know there’s some of the Boost commentary in the letter calling out things like customer acquisition, frequency, ticket sizes. I think those are all really important elements for restaurants. So you have DoorDash. I think that’s a really encouraging leading signal. But when you think about maybe the tenor of conversations with other potential partners, could you maybe give us a sense and maybe some type of timeline for how long it takes to attract others. Is it quarters? Is it really multiyear effort? That will be really helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Josh. We’re super happy with what Boost has been doing. So as you know, we started this with a very controlled approach where we took it upon ourselves to create Boost and to learn as quick as possible, continue to add features and functionality to the Boost that allow more and more opportunities for ourselves, but also with partners. And we do see a very compelling horizon with partners in particular. We’ve had a lot of interest. And again, we want to take on a mindset of making sure that we’re running really controlled experiments. So, we’re creating value for both parties and our customers. One of the sole value propositions for the Boost program is the fact that a lot of the people that we’re serving have never had access to a rewards program, and certainly one that isn’t as easy and as simple and as straightforward as what we’ve done with Boost. So, we want to make sure that we have a very high bar for our partnerships and that we’re optimizing for learning, and that comes through a lot of experimentation. And we’re matching the transactions with brands and companies and sellers that our customers love and would be delighted to utilize. So that’s kind of the thesis around it, but we have received a lot of interest. And as you might have seen on Twitter, we are hiring lead roles for the sales function, but we definitely expect this to be full with a lot of opportunities for partnership down the line and a really interesting business. And Josh, just want to help also on the funding and the economic side of the Boost program, just to clarify, we fund – we have – as part of the controlled rollout of the program, as Jack was mentioning, have funded a lot of this ourselves. But the cost flow in is contra revenue. So the $135 million that we disclosed this quarter in revenue, excluding Bitcoin, is already net of any Boost cost associated with our Cash Card program. And as we continue to attract more, that gives us even more opportunities to really strategically fund this program with other partners and deliver value to our customers. Thank you, both. Very, very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kwok with KBW. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I had a quick one around the transaction event losses. It seems like that rate as a percentage of GPV has been taking up a little bit. I was wondering, is there anything specific that’s causing that? And is that the rate that we should use going forward? Sure, happy to help. Risk loss was relatively consistent year-over-year at 6% of adjusted revenue. And this line item, for us, is really driven by volume growth across each of our seller business, our cash business and our capital business. And so just to put a little bit of color on that, seller GPV grew 25%, as you saw this past quarter. Cash, we disclosed in the first quarter, cash volumes grew almost 150%. And capital originations grew 36% this past quarter. So, we’ve got strong volume of growth across the business, and that is obviously what leads into the risk loss, which has stayed consistent year-over-year at that 6% of adjusted revenue. On the seller business, risk loss remains below 0.1% of GPV. And on our capital business with core flex loans, loss rates are consistent with historical averages at less than 4%. Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you. Thanks. Your last question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Quick follow-up on the habituation and usage of the Square Cash App Card. I know that Boost is a part of that, but as you think about the economics going forward, do you see yourselves delivering enough incremental value or enough incremental people to a merchant to shift the cost of those deals more and more to your partners and less and less coming from Square? And kind of what’s the evolution of that so far? Hey, Brett. Yes, happy to help. As we shared just a few minutes ago, we’re in the early days of the Boost program. We’re about a year in. I think we launched it May of last year, just less than a year after the launch of the Cash Card itself. And we continue to prove out the value here, not only to consumers, where we see a strong incentive through Boost to join into the Cash Card program where, as Jack said, we believe we have a really unique offering around Instant Rewards for our customers here as a prepaid debit card, but also delivering value for merchants. And so we’re in the early days of that. And this DoorDash program in this past quarter is the first milestone, first proof point towards our ability to drive traffic and drive customers into merchants. And the team continues to innovate here. The Cash team continues to be creative and experiment with Boost. There’s also things planned in the roadmap for the future that we’ll be excited to share with you when the time is right. But we’re in the very, very early days here, and we’re excited. Great. Thanks for the time. And at this time, I’d like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our third quarter 2019 earnings call on November 6. Thanks again, for participating today.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.
First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
On November 1, we filed a press release and 8-K announcing that we completed the sale of Caviar, our food ordering platform to DoorDash on October 31. Today, in addition to our shareholder letter we have filed an 8-K that includes Caviar financial statements for the third quarter of 2019 and the preceding six quarters, which I encourage you all to read.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also during this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Additionally, as discussed in the shareholder letter, we will be discontinuing the use of adjusted revenue beginning next quarter, following receipt of a comment letter from and discussions with the SEC.
As background, we introduced adjusted revenue in November 2015 as a supplemental non-GAAP metric for investors to measure our business performance and growth, and provide greater comparability to other payment solution providers. Additionally, management uses adjusted revenue internally to measure the performance of our business.
Going forward, our statement of operations will continue to disclose total net revenue, transaction based cost and Bitcoin costs determined in accordance with GAAP, which are the key components of adjusted revenue. We are also introducing new guidance measures this quarter on GAAP gross profit, as well as the sum of transaction based costs and Bitcoin costs.
We have posted an FAQ document on our Investor Relations website with further details on this reporting change, as well as the spreadsheet with our historical financials. There are no changes to any other GAAP or non-GAAP metrics.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. A few comments before I pass it to Amrita and we answer your questions.
What makes Square unique is our focus on building a robust ecosystem. An ecosystem to us is a set of tools which solve critical problems for folks in remarkable ways, and more importantly, reinforce one another. For instance, a seller might come to Square because we are the fastest and most elegant way to manage their payments in-store, and through that one move, they find a broader set of tools, such as capital to get a quick loan, a website builder to sell online, the most advanced register to put on their countertop, and payroll to pay their employees instantly via Cash App.
Likewise, an individual comes in to Cash App because they received some money from their friends or a new employer. Not only do they find the fastest way to send and receive money, but also a free Visa Card they can use everywhere for purchases, and then some rewards program called Boost, a way to invest their money in the stock market or even Bitcoin, and a way to quickly pay a yoga teacher or dog walker.
Having one of these ecosystems of scale is incredible, but having two that can interact with and strengthen each other is profound. With the sale of Caviar to DoorDash complete, we’ve taken the opportunity to look deeply at how to best guide these forward.
With the seller ecosystem, we’ve built and shown a long-term profitable business, one that has an expected adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 30% for full year 2019. Compare this to a margin of negative 9% in 2015, at the time of our IPO. Given the efficient payback periods and ROI for the tools in this ecosystem, we’ve decided to significantly grow our sales and marketing efforts this year and into 2020.
Our first investments will be focused on bringing more awareness to all the software tools we make available to sellers to run their entire business, in addition to managing their payments, and we will continue to prioritize investments to grow our seller network beyond our expectations.
Cash has been another incredible story. Excluding Bitcoin, Cash App revenue was $159 million in Q3, up 115% year-over-year. Like seller, Cash App also has a broad portfolio of tools that reinforce to each other, and this quarter we successfully redesigned the app to make all of them much easier to find and use.
Adding to send, store and spend, we introduced a new capability this quarter, investing, and did so in a way we believe is transformational. Today, on the Cash App you can purchase stock instantly for free when the market is opened or scheduled when it’s closed, but we wanted to solve a much bigger problem we saw.
Most people can’t even afford to buy one share of the company they want to own. So we took everything we learned from Bitcoin and fractionalize the stock market. Now someone who believes in Berkshire Hathaway A, currently trading above $300,000, can buy $42 or even $1 worth of the company, and hold or sell it at any point. Others will offer this ability eventually, but none will match our ease or the fact that this one app serves most of the needs your bank did in the past.
For many of the folks we serve, Cash App is the first introduction to financial services, and for many more in the mainstream, it’s the best replacement for a number of apps they had to otherwise cobble together to make work.
Finally, we’ve shown what a thoughtful and deliberate approach has paid off. We started this company over 10 years ago with hopes of solving only one critical need sellers had. We saw the opportunity to build a rich ecosystem around that to serve multiple needs and ended up building two of those ecosystems. I’m really proud of how far we’ve come, and given everything we’ve proven to ourselves and all the positive signals in our business. I’m really excited to accelerate our investments to grow these ecosystems together.
Each of these businesses have massive potential when taken alone, but the magic really lies in how they will work together. This is a fundamentally new idea and our entire focus now is on being the greatest and most inclusive financial ecosystem to serve all needs.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Amrita. Thanks Jack. There are four key highlights that I want to share today. First, we continue to drive strong revenue growth in the third quarter and recently completed the sale of Caviar. Second, given sellers’ strong profitability profile and attractive returns, we are increasing our investments in go-to-market and also aligning our team’s efforts to prioritize the highest return product opportunities in 2020.
Third, as the Cash App service has scaled, over the past three years, it has built a strong business model with compelling cohort economics that have improved the ecosystem margins each of the last three years. Fourth, we are raising our guidance for our business ex-Caviar in 2019, and providing a preliminary outlook on growth and profitability in 2020.
First, our strong revenue growth. In the third quarter, total net revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $1.27 billion. Adjusted revenue grew 40% year-over-year to $602 million, and gross profit grew 42% to $500 million. We saw continued strength from the seller and cash businesses, offsetting underperformance from Caviar in the quarter. We also had a sizable EBITDA beat in the quarter, driven by our core business performance, as well as the timing of certain expenses.
We completed the transaction to sell Caviar to DoorDash on October 31. Caviar is included in our reported financials for the entire third quarter and will be included in part of the fourth quarter. Excluding Caviar from the first three quarters of 2019, we would have seen our year-over-year growth for total net revenue and adjusted revenue increase by one point and two points respectively.
Second, given sellers strong profitability, we are capturing the opportunity to invest a compelling return and orienting the team to address the highest return product opportunities in 2020. In the third quarter of 2019, our seller ecosystem generated $918 million of total net revenue and $364 million of gross profit, which increased 27% and 26% year-over-year respectively.
As we’re investing more in go-to-market, we’re seeing good early results, and I wanted to call out a couple of examples. First, our marketing campaigns this year have driven an up-lift across key indicators; including awareness, web traffic and revenue contribution from new seller cohorts.
Second, reducing the pricing on our newer hardware devices, Square Register and Square Terminal, has resulted in an uplift in unit sales, which is bringing new sellers into our ecosystem. From a product perspective, as we think ahead of the work we have to do in 2020, we are aligning our seller teams to our key priorities of omni-channel, global and financial services.
We have recently decided to pull back resources on the marketplace product that supports Eventbrite’s core online processing volumes in 2020. We are exploring other opportunities to partner with Eventbrite, although we don’t expect these to be meaningful to GPV in the near term.
While the originally contemplated Eventbrite deal would have contributed to GPV, the impact to revenue would have been de-minimis. Given this, we have decided to double down on our higher potential return opportunities in our core focus areas, to strengthen our platform and our ability to address multiple customers who contribute to meaningful revenue growth.
Third, Cash App has a strong business model with compelling cohort economics. As with the seller business, it starts with efficient customer acquisitions. For Cash App this comes through peer-to-peer network effects.
Next, like seller, Cash App retains the majority of our active customers through our strong product appeal. We then cross-sell our new products and features across our base to drive more money movement and higher average revenue per customer, which our new tabs redesign will help us do more effectively.
All of this leads to cash having achieved positive revenue retention for each of its monthly customer cohorts since 2015. Said differently, if Cash App did not acquire another new customer, revenues would still grow from the existing base. Low customer acquisition costs combined with positive revenue retention drive compelling cohorts and payback economics’ dynamics that are very similar to what we have seen in the seller business.
This has provided a strong foundation for rapid and efficient growth, while expanding margins as Cash App has scaled. We expect dynamics to continue to improve as we scale our customer base and launch new products like Investing.
Fourth, we are raising the guidance for our business ex-Caviar in 2019, and providing our initial outlook for revenue and profitability in 2020. As a reminder, as Jason noted, starting next quarter we will no longer be reporting or guiding to adjusted revenue. We provide certain adjusted revenue measures this quarter, only as a transitional bridge. You can find additional information on this change in our shareholder letter and on our Investor Relations website.
There are two factors impacting our updated full year 2019 guidance of $2.24 billion to $2.25 billion in adjusted revenue. First, underlying trends in our seller and Cash App ecosystems increased the top end of our guidance by $15 million.
Second, the timing of the Caviar sale and its underperformance reduced our guidance by $45 million. These offsetting factors result in a net decrease of $30 million to the top end of our full year 2019 guidance. Though again, what we are managing going forward is a core business with strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We are maintaining our guidance for 60% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2019. We plan to reinvest Q3 outperformance given the returns we see and the opportunity to drive future growth.
Turning to 2020, based on our preliminary outlook we expect to achieve year-over-year gross profit and adjusted revenue growth in the low 30% range, on a pro forma basis excluding Caviar. In 2020 we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be roughly flat compared to the 18% adjusted EBITDA margins implied by our updated 2019 guidance. We expect to reinvest the entirety of the two points of EBITDA margin unlocked by the sale of Caviar.
A key investment area in 2020 includes sales and marketing spend into the seller ecosystem. We expect to invest over $75 million in incremental seller sales and marketing over 2019 levels, targeting payback periods to remain within four quarters. Additionally, 2020 guidance includes a larger than normal office expansion related to our Oakland office, as well as additional regional expansions, which will add an incremental one time step-up of $50 million of operating expenses.
Finally, we plan to host an Investor Day in mid-March. Since our last Investor Day in 2017, we have more than doubled our revenues and gross profit scales, tripled our EBITDA and scaled two unique ecosystems for sellers and individuals. In our 2020 Investor Day we will provide a deeper update into our long-term vision, our market opportunity, strategy and business model for the seller and cash ecosystems, and our long-term financial model. We’ll provide more information on Investor Day in the coming months.
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Again, your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang. Your line is open. I hope you can hear me. Sorry about that. Thanks for all the disclosure; a lot to digest.
On 2020, I’ll ask there, just can you give us an idea on the growth between the two ecosystems, seller and cash, and I’m curious if you can give us some idea here. Thanks for the EBITDA margin disclosure on seller. You know how quickly you can scale the Cash App margins and can that ultimately approach the margins you’re seeing, that is Cash App versus seller? Thank you. Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. So I’ll start off on the growth for 2020 between seller and Cash. As noted in the prepared remarks, we’re expecting low 30% gross profit growth, which is similar to what we would have expected for adjusted revenue.
Two things to keep in mind there: First, our exit rate from 2019 and the fourth quarter adjusted revenue and gross profit guide implies a 37% growth rate and 36% growth rate respectively, excluding caviar. And secondly, we are making meaningful investments into the business, with payback periods of about four quarters, particularly for the seller sales and marketing investment.
So to break it apart between seller and cash, with seller, we’re expecting steady revenue in gross profit growth in 2020 from the current Q3 baseline that you heard of about 27% and 26% growth respectively. But again, keep in mind these investments that we’re making tend to have a four-quarter payback. So we’d expect to start seeing the impact on top line numbers toward the end of 2020 as we add new cohorts into the seller ecosystem.
For Cash App we’ve reached pretty significant scale representing a quarter of our revenue in the third quarter very rapidly. The growth in 2019 has been greater than 100% on the topline, and now with this over $600 million annualized revenue run rate, naturally growth rates at this level, you’d expect to come down over time.
The biggest drivers for Cash App, as you know Instant Deposit and Cash Card will be growing in 2020 off of a larger base as those two business lines have ramped rapidly during 2019 and ultimately we’re focused on growing revenue scale on a dollar basis here.
That said, we’re continuing to invest aggressively into both, our Cash App ecosystem, as well as our seller ecosystem and we think we’re in the early days there in terms of customer acquisition and in terms of the product roadmap. So we’d expect to continue to see strong and growing contributions from Cash App going forward.
With respect to margins, just quickly, we see attributes in the cash business that are very similar to what we see in the seller business; in terms of efficient customer acquisition, in terms of retaining customers over the long-term, and in terms of positive revenue retention, and because of that we’ve been able to increase cash margins each of the last three years and we’d expect to do the same in 2020. So over the long-term we see a very positive trajectory there as well. Alright, very clear. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hey, thanks guys. You know just given that 30% margin disclosure on seller and obviously the backdrop of the lift is from Caviar sale and margins. Maybe just help us understand the priorities around the investments in terms of U.S. Seller versus omni-channel versus international? How can we think about the magnitude of the payback you’re expecting and what that could mean in terms of just revenue inflection and we appreciate the guidance on 2020? Thank you. So I’ll start off and Amrita can follow with some answers as well. But I think the most important thing is we have recognized a pretty compelling opportunity, specifically within Seller, and we have found a lot of efficiencies in our models and we found a lot of areas that we can really focus on in sales and marketing that we think will move the needle for us in meaningful ways.
So a lot of what we’ve identified, it’s certainly continuing to build upon the product and being the best product out there, but we think we could do a much better job in supporting it around awareness externally, but more importantly awareness is internally to our customers today.
So, as we are set apart by the ecosystem nature of our business, the most important thing is that our sellers find all the tools that would help them run their entire business, and that’s where we could do a whole – we could do a lot better job, both in terms of the product experience itself and showing people the right tools to fit the right needs, with marketing via email or direct response and also with our sales team and account management.
Our goal here mainly is to focus our sellers and make them aware of everything that we have to offer, because if we have sellers who find value in multiple services and products from us, we build a much more durable relationship with the seller, so that’s the immediate goal. But the net is we see a pretty significant opportunity to accelerate our investment and really grow the overall base. Just to add to that Darrin, with respect to the sizing, the $75 million of incremental seller, non-GAAP sales and marketing in 2020, just to size that relative to that number in 2019, it’s a 2x increase over 2019’s incremental spend on both a dollar and a percentage basis.
You know we have a large and fragmented addressable market for both seller and cash, and we see tremendous attractive opportunities to invest into that, specifically on seller. We see three primary areas of investment as we think about our strong brand awareness of 80%, but our relatively low product awareness of 9%.We can see ways to move the needle across marketing, across sales and across hardware pricing.
Specifically on marketing, we’re investing in campaigns that improve our awareness of the broader product set beyond just payments. We already initiated some campaigns this year in April, and then again in September and October, and we’ve seen some encouraging early results. In April we reached 7 million businesses and we’ve driven an uplift across indicators like awareness, web traffic and revenue contribution. So we would expect, even with this elevated spend in 2020, to still see around a four-quarter payback overall as a blended payback across all of our investments.
Frankly, today we believe we are too efficient in the U.S. at a three quarter payback and across some products even less than a three quarter payback. So we see opportunities here to expand the funnel even further.
From a sales perspective, we see strong ROI comparable to marketing, so we want to lean in there in 2020. And then from a hardware perspective, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we see that when we flex pricing on compelling products like terminal and register, we’re able to attract more sellers. So those are the three primary ways that we look to deploy incremental funds in 2020. Okay, thanks guys. Your next question comes from the line of Beatrice Calderon from Square. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. So I’m a Square Seller, and I am – my business is called The Housing Works – The Shop. And as a retail business it would be helpful to see sales and inventory in one report. Has Square considered creating a report that would provide the sales and the inventory and also software percentages? Yeah. Thanks Beatrice and thanks for using us. This is a request we get from sellers a lot and we know that the managing inventory is pretty difficult and exceedingly complex, and we believe that you know ultimately it’s our job to remove a bunch of that complexity to make it easier.
So while I can’t share the full details yet, heading into next year we’re looking to spend some time adding new reports like this, and more broadly looking at opportunities to remove more and more complexity from the task of inventory and reports, because ultimately if we simplify things we’re giving time back, so that you can focus more on your customers and your business. Great, thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about Cash App. You gave the revenue growth rate which is very helpful, 115%. Maybe if you could just help us think through the composition of drivers and maybe how that’s changing over time as either new products are introduced like stock trading or the app you design or direct deposit, and just how that can ultimately influence the growth composition of the drivers there? Hey Josh, I’ll take that. So yes, we had strong revenue growth for Cash App in the third quarter, up 115%, with gross profit actually up even higher at 125% year-over-year. We’re seeing as discussed, strong unit economics and cohort economics here.
The primary drivers in terms of monetization levers across Cash App, we have a half a dozen of them, but the two primary ones are Instant Deposit and Cash Card. However, when we manage our product feature set across the ecosystems we think about both, engagement drivers and monetization levers, and things like Investing enable us to introduce new engagement drivers into the ecosystem that have the potential to raise awareness and raise the daily utility for Cash App, which then impacts the other levers that we have in Cash App around monetization.
An example of that, so we’ve seen more recently with our Bitcoin product which we launched about a year ago, is that Bitcoin actives have a 2x attach rate to Cash Card, which means that when you’re using the app on a more regular basis and when you’re finding daily utility in the app, you’re finding other important uses that we can provide you within the app. And so the TABS redesign was another piece of that, to provide increased discoverability and navigation to many of those new products that we’ve launched over time. Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yeah, hi guys. I saw the GPV stabilize this quarter at over 25% given a slight acceleration on our math. Just curious what drove the strength, because it had been slightly moderated in the past few quarters and it sounds like you expect similar GPV growth in 2020? So with the investment now in seller, will we see an acceleration eventually in the revenues and GPV from that line in fourth quarter 2020 and maybe in to 2021? Thanks. Hey Bryan, thanks for the question. Yes, we drove strong GPV growth at scale in the third quarter, up 25% year-over-year to $28 billion, and if you look at the last four quarters combined, we’ve driven over $100 billion in GPV. To break down what happened in Q3, there is a few important drivers to discuss across both existing and new sellers.
Existing sellers were a source of strength for us as they have been historically with positive revenue retention across all cohorts, and then on new sellers, we have three drivers as we saw new sellers adding to the Square platform.
First, larger seller GPV growth was in line with Q2, up 34% year-over-year and now comprises 55% of total GPV as a mix. Second, we’re focused on expanding our total addressable market. In our shareholder letter you saw us calling out new omni-channel use cases like stadiums as an example.
Third, we had a strong growth in the quarter from international markets, where we actually had an acceleration in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Though these markets are still relatively a small part of our business, growth in international continues to outpace the U.S.
As you look ahead to 2020, of course we don’t guide to GPV, but a couple of things for you to keep in mind on the trajectory of GPV in Q4 and into the future. First is, remember we implemented the pricing change on our seller business for card present transactions on November 1, and we’d expect that to have an impact on GPV growth in the fourth quarter and into 2020. Although from a revenue and transaction margin perspective, we expect neutral to positive impact.
And then, again thinking longer term, the investments that we’re making in our seller business in terms of sales and marketing today, we’re seeing encouraging early signs around them, but we do expect a payback period in the fourth quarter range, which means that these incremental investments would add incremental absolute dollars to GPV in late 2020 and into 2021. Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Hey, good afternoon guys. A follow-up on Cash App, it’s more of a strategic question. How do you think about how Cash App is differentiated from the sort of like avalanche of other sort of neo-banks that are popping up like a Chime or Discover Direct banking? And then maybe more broadly, you know you just announced the ability to purchase fractional stocks, but what is the pipeline of additional services that you’re planning to launch the Cash App. Like should we be expecting installment lending perhaps or may be a Credit Card offering, a credit related offering? Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question, Lisa. There is a lot out there as you point out and one of the things that I’m really excited about is just like Square, we’ve taken on a bunch of the complexity of connecting together the most critical needs in one place, and what that means is that people can come to it for very different reasons.
As Amrita pointed out earlier, like some people come to the Cash App, because it’s the easiest way, the fastest way to buy a Bitcoin, and that allows for us to show them the other attributes it offers as well, including sending and receiving fiat money, storing money, getting a Cash Card that they can use anywhere Visa is accepted or go to an ATM to get paper cash out.
And what is important about this is we’re not just an app for one specific thing, but a lot of the critical needs you might have that you would typically look to from a traditional bank are built right in the apps. So you can go to the app store, and you can download this app and you come in and you have so much incredible capabilities right away, and entirely new capabilities like investing the fractional shares.
So in terms of the competition and how we think about building it out, it really goes back to the Square story of putting all these things together in one experience. We believe it is very strong and they actually play-off each other and reinforce one another in very interesting ways too. So we think that’s a real strength.
In terms of fractional shares and what features are coming, we’re really excited about this feature. As I said, we think it’s pretty transformational and we do believe that this gives access to a part of the financial system that most have been left out of, and there is a number of things that we could do if you just look at the other services within Cash App to really bring this to even more light and into even more strength, and that’s just not what our competitors can do, because they are focused on just one aspect of these financial services instead of considering how they all exist together and how they work together.
And in terms of future features for Cash App, generally we’re just constantly looking for critical needs, and where we can make things in order of magnitude better in terms of the experience or accessibility or how we might be able to reinvent the approach of how people thought about buying stocks for instance. So that’s what we’re looking at. We have a bunch of experiments we’re excited about, but nothing else to announce today. Terrific! Very clear, thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Lisa. Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. My question is on the competitive environment in the seller business. There’s a lot that has happened over the last few years in terms of growth of integrated players and there’s now a lot of cloud-based POS providers out there, and of course there has been some consolidation. So can you talk about what you’re seeing from a competition point of view now versus a few years ago? I don’t think it’s really any different from when we started the company. We saw a lot of folks who were building solutions for parts of the ecosystem, but very few who are building an ecosystem and that is what continues to set us apart, both on the seller side and also more recently on the cash side.
We don’t have a company that’s just focused on one tool or one use case. It’s really focused on how do we ensure a seller, number one, can run a business and ideally how do we help them make more sales, and a lot of our tools are really focused on looking for opportunities to help sellers make more sales, which is great for us, because if they make more sales, we grow the business and as we grow the business, we can up more sellers, and we just don’t see much else to that out there.
So what really sets us apart is, even if there are companies out there who are attempting to bite at the edges of an ecosystem, there are only doing it with one ecosystem like seller. They don’t have the equal pairing of individual ecosystem like cash.
So while we can focus on the strength of the seller ecosystem, if you zoom out a bit, what’s really powerful is that we have an app scale seller ecosystem, and we have been app scale buyer ecosystem in Cash App, and they are in the same company.
So this is very rare, and I don’t know of many others that have this capacity and that I think really speaks to our true differentiation and our true power and our true potential ahead. As I said in my opening remarks, we do believe we have a lot of invention to bring to financial services, and we’re guiding that invention by bringing more access to more people, and that’s both sellers and now individuals through the Cash App. So I think it’s quite strong, and I just don’t see its component in the market. Harshita, just to add to that, you know it’s always been a competitive landscape, but we continue to gain share. Our volume is growing at 25% these days relative to the rest of merchant acquirers on average growing 5% to 8%, and the networks growing low double digits. So we are growing, we’re growing fast and we’re continuing to take share in a large and frankly, still very fragmented market and that just speaks to payment volumes.
Our ecosystem does much more than that as Jack was saying. We have many more monetization levers beyond payments when you look at subscription and services for seller, and when you look at the broader buyer ecosystem with Cash App. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Great! Good evening. I wanted to just parse out a little bit. I know you’ve talked about it already, but the investments necessary to kind of capture you know the incremental seller, I’m trying to just think through larger merchants or larger sellers relative to different verticals or really just deepening the product penetration and it sounds like a lot of it is an awareness to drive deeper product penetration. I’m just trying to parse this three.
And then the other just quick question is on the international side on the seller, can you just give us some idea about what those cohorts look like relative to the United States in terms of size, maybe the level of sophistication and maybe even the number of products purchased? Thanks. Yeah, thanks Dan. So in terms of the investments, I mean fundamentally we believe that we have a suite of tools for sellers of scale, scales from the very small to the very large, and where we don’t, we have a platform and API strategy that larger sellers can fill in whatever they need to, whether it’d be legacy, hardware or inventory systems. So that strategy has continued to play out. And as we think about our investments, as we talked a little bit about – a little earlier, we have a bunch of levers to pull, so only awareness of more of the product is important.
Sales, our sales team and account management is another important area for us, and hardware is an area that we can also see a lot of potential, and this is independent of whether you’re a large seller, you’re a restaurant, you’re a retail organization, we can really customize a solution around each one.
So, we’re not necessarily guiding that to a particular size of sellers. It’s more focused on the use cases and how utilizing more of our tools will make your business a lot more efficient and run better ultimately, hopefully leading to more sales for you and your company. And I’ll just add to that Dan. On the plan about larger sellers, we continue to have strong traction there with larger sellers growing 34% year-over-year in the third quarter. The products that address larger sellers as you know are vertical point of sale around retail and restaurants or developer platforms where you can create more customized product offerings for larger sellers and some of our newer hardware products, terminal and register.
In terms of the go-to-market ways that we can address larger sellers, our marketing campaigns we believe address small and large sellers alike, and we do see that larger sellers have a tendency to take on more products, and so the focus of the campaign being the broad suite of products that we offer beyond just payments; we feel can resonate with large sellers.
Finally, the sales team growth, which we expect in 2020 should also address larger sellers’ needs and more complex seller needs.
I did want to address your international question. We see that our cohorts of customers internationally, similar to the U.S., have positive revenue retention, which is an important thing for us obviously to continue to measure.
We most recently launched our terminal product in Australia, Canada and the UK in this past quarter and those launches were successful launches for us. We’re seeing that we’re unlocking new use cases as we bring our full suite of products to our international market. So we’re excited to continue doing that in 2020. That’s great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. Hi, I appreciate you taking the question. I wonder if I could dig just a little bit deeper into the Cash App. I mean you’ve talked about a number of ways you’re looking to monetize and if there is any pushback we get is that it’s really an Instant Deposit product first and foremost, and I think you flushed out the means by which to advance beyond that.
But I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on the merchant flywheel. It strikes me that this is a pretty powerful tool for merchants who have receipts from Cash App or a Square Capital loan where the case may be and that it can really act as a small business bank account substitute for traditional account. Could you just elaborate on that and how you think that sort of plays out to the long-term ability to monetize that ecosystem. Andrew. I’m not sure I’m following your question. Are you talking about the Cash App or the Square Card? Well, I mean I think about Square Card as being sort of integral to you know that whole value proposition. Yes. So we have two main offerings here that I think speak to the flywheel that you’re talking about. One is the Square Card which allows sellers to store money with Square and we can also issue them a MasterCard that allows them to spend instantly and get access to their funds or run their business instantly. And we think that one has been a pretty amazing product experience, but entirely new functionality that serves as another reason to join Square and to enter into our ecosystem.
In terms of the Cash App, there is a lot of opportunity between our receipts as a way to drive more Cash App downloads and usage. And there is potential intersection between what we’re doing around loyalty on the seller side and Boost on the Cash App side.
So these are things that are definitely questions for us and we’d love to experiment with, but it all goes back to the broader point that we believe that while these two ecosystems are extremely strong at scale, and quite powerful and that each one of them has tools that reinforce one another, it’s when ecosystems themselves reinforce one another that makes the company truly incredible.
So we will continue to look for smart ways to bring these two ecosystems together, driven by customer needs and that’s customer needs on the seller side, but also on the Cash App side. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citi. Your line is open. Good evening, thanks for the question. Jack, I want to ask you more of a philosophical question. As you think about these two ecosystems, both have competitive dynamics and different phases of maturity. How does Square think about balancing the investment between Seller and Cash App, and perhaps what are some of the key variables that you consider when you’re in the decisioning process as you invest across the company broadly? Yeah, thanks Pete, great question. So this is going to be something that we’re constantly learning from. The most important thing is we recognize this opportunity on the seller side of you know – like how are you thinking about investing within the seller and all the payback periods we’re seeing, the ROI we’re seeing and the tools, it just begged for more investment. It just felt like we are leaving opportunity on the table by not focusing on growing this in a much more substantial way.
Cash on the other hand has had that mindset for some time and has really been focused on network first. And what gives me a lot of confidence is we have a pretty deep understanding of how both businesses work and what levers to pull, where we can be pretty agile about when to drive growth and when not to.
And we’ve come a long way with the Cash App and how we think about building that network, but ultimately over time we want to continue to build features that people love, that people can’t find anywhere else. And as I said in my previous answer, I think there’s a lot of potential between the two ecosystems. So we will be constantly looking for these opportunities to grow both ecosystems, but more importantly ways to connect the two together. And Pete just to tie that to our 2020 outlook, we see strong opportunities to deliberately invest in both of the ecosystem in 2020. For seller, today as you know, as we disclosed we see strong profitability with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 30% in 2019 expected for the full year; that’s up from negative 9% in 2015. In a very short period of time we’ve been able to scale this ecosystem while driving strong profitability, and seeing very compelling returns as Jack was saying.
So we want to intentionally invest for future growth, in our go-to-market efforts that we outlined earlier in the call, and so for 2020 we expect margins in the seller business as a result to slightly come down and we do expect to start seeing returns on these investments that we’re making toward the end of 2020 and into 2021.
With Cash, given the strong cohort economics that we’ve seen, given the margin expansion that we’ve seen over time, over the past few years, and given the continued scaling of the ecosystem, we expect to see some margin improvement in 2020, even as we continue to invest in scaling the ecosystem. So those are some of the dynamics for how this investment model plays out for 2020. That’s very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is open. Hi, this is Allison on for George. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the GPV commentary from earlier. It looks like the year-over-year growth and the sub-125,000 GPV seller category accelerated this quarter versus 2Q. I’m wondering if there is any color you can provide there? Thank you. Thanks for the question Allison. GPV growth from larger sellers was 34% in the third quarter, and actually also in the second quarter. From a mix perspective, larger sellers were up slightly quarter-over-quarter, so 55% in terms of mix and 53% in terms of mix in the second quarter. So we continue to see real traction with larger sellers and continue to build out products as mentioned earlier in terms of vertical points of sale, in terms of hardware, and in terms of the developer platforms to address this base of customers. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Hey guys, just a quick clarification on a question. Just on the clarification, so I want to make sure I’ve got these numbers apples-to-apples right here. So your growth in 2019 ex-Caviar is forecasted now at 46%, and on that same basis we’re talking about low 30’s in 2020. So I just wanted to get a clarification on that. And then, can you just give us a sense on the $75 million of incremental sales and marketing, how much of that will be U.S. versus international? Sure, I’ll take that Jason. You’ve got that math right in terms of full year 2019. The guide at the midpoint, ex-Caviar for the full year is $2.1 billion, which is a 46% growth rate year-over-year, which is actually the same growth rate that 2018 would have been on an ex-Caviar basis.
But as you think ahead to 2020, keep in mind the exit rate that we’ve got coming out of 2019, which is a 37% rate in the fourth quarter, ex-Caviar unadjusted revenue, and 36% growth rate on gross profit at the midpoint.
In terms of the $75 million of marketing investments, U.S. versus international, you know the international markets today are about 5% of our revenues. They will be a higher percentage of our marketing investments, but the vast majority of our marketing investments still go toward our U.S. markets. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi, thanks. It’s Jamie at Susquehanna. I just wanted to ask Amrita, in your prepared remarks you had mentioned that some of the EBITDA upside in the Q3 which was a surprise to us, you said that some of it came from core and some of that came from timing of expenses. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit about that.
And I just have to ask about Eventbrite, those comments were helpful too, but if I was interpreting what you’re saying relative to the GPV versus what sounded like a less important revenue factor, was that about price or am I just oversimplifying? Thank you. Sure. On the first part of your question James, on the EBITDA beat, that’s right, it was driven by both over performance in our seller and cash ecosystems, offset by underperformance in Caviar, along with over performance related to expense timing, as well as some efficiencies.
We do expect most of those expenses to materialize in future quarters, and as we have in the past, we plan to reinvest any outperformance that we’ve had back into these ecosystem through both product and sales and marketing efforts to grow for the long-term.
With respect to Eventbrite, I didn’t quite catch your question, but I think you’re asking why there is less of a revenue impact relative to GPV and yes, the take rate on a deal like Eventbrite is much lower. So that’s why from a GPV perspective there would have been an impact, but from a revenue perspective the contribution for Eventbrite would have been de-minimis. Got it, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Given all the puts and takes in your evolving business mix and not to steal thunder from Analyst Day, but how would you frame up your kind of normalized margin profile at this point. I know that you have a completely different business than you did at our first Analyst Day meeting, so I was just wondering if you could comment on that. And then just a quick bolt-on is what’s the revenue model for the stock trading feature. How do you make money on that? Thanks. Sure, I can take that. You know at our last Investor Day, Cash App was sort of a twinkle in our eye, and obviously it has grown rapidly since then; it’s now a quarter of our revenues. And so clearly I think at this next Investor Day we’ll be sharing much more with you about Cash App in terms of product roadmap and business model and so you know I think it’s premature for us today to give you a long-term view in terms of margin profile.
So what I can say is as we share with you this quarter, you know compared to our last Investor Day, the dynamics in our Seller ecosystem, which was the majority of our business in 2017 have largely stayed the same or gotten better. At last Investor Day we talked about a 20% to 25% long-term top line growth and 35% long-term margins. And just a year and a half later now in 2019 we stand here having achieved nearly a 30% margin by year-end and having exceeded the top line growth targets, all with three to four quarter payback and positive revenue retention.
And then with Cash App, we have scaled it rapidly since the last Investor Day and as mentioned, have continued to see margin expansion from Cash App for each of the last three years with very similar dynamics in terms of cohort economics and compelling returns on our investments. Very similar dynamics in Cash App to what we see in the Seller ecosystem. So we’re excited to share with you more when we meet at Investor Day.
With respect to monetization of Investing, as we noted there is no commission fees related to our investing product today within Cash App. The majority of the costs associated with Investing will be brokerage costs and will be included in our sales and marketing line related to Cash App. We really view this product set to be an engagement driver for us as we mentioned earlier, to help build out the network, and to help bring discoverability and daily utility to the app that enables growth for other revenue streams within the app Thanks so much. And that is all the time we have for questions. At this time I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for some closing remarks. Thank you everyone for joining our call. I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call on February 26. Thanks again for participating today. This concludes today’s conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.
First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call. We have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market closed. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Additionally, as discussed in the shareholder letter, we discontinued the use of adjusted revenue last quarter, following receipt of a comment letter from and discussions with the SEC. Our statement of operations continue to disclose total net revenue, transaction-based costs and Bitcoin costs determined in accordance with GAAP, which are the key components of adjusted revenue.
We also introduced new guidance measures on GAAP gross profit as well as the sum of transaction-based costs and Bitcoin costs. There are no changes to any other GAAP or non-GAAP metrics. We have posted a spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website with our historical financials and additional details related to our income statement.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. A few comments from me and Amrita before we get to your questions.
2019 was a very good year for us. We continue to refine and build upon our ecosystem strategy, which we believe is our biggest competitive differentiator. Many companies only get an opportunity to scale one ecosystem and audience. We're in the incredible position to scale two ecosystems Seller and Cash Approximately, representing sellers, their customers and individuals wanting to access more of the financial system. And we're increasingly happy with the results.
In 2019, we launched a lot of key products into our Seller ecosystem. The Square Card, Square Online Store, Order Manager, the Invoices app and Square Assistant and Appointments and Square Terminal in the U.K., Australia and Canada. We also launched a number of new marketing campaigns around the world, our latest reaching an estimated eight million businesses and updated our U.S. based pricing to 2.6% plus $0.10. Our products and developer platform are resonating with large sellers too. As of Q4, 55% of our GPV was from larger sellers.
Cash App launched a redesign for easier navigation and discoverability, boosted partnerships and equities investing. The investing feature has seen the fastest adoption of any product launched within the cash ecosystem.
Cash App continues to exceed our expectations, consistently found in the top 15 free apps in the App Store and driving to 24 million monthly active customers as of December 2019, which is up from 15 million in December of 2018. The Cash Card is also at scale being used by over 20% of our monthly active customers. The peer-to-peer transfer’s network continues to be our best acquisition channel as each person with an account brings in more folks just by sending or receiving money. Those new to the app then go on to discover Bitcoin, the Cash Card, Boost and Investing. It's a strong reinforcing model we don't see elsewhere.
All this has given us a powerful foundation to build upon in 2020. We continue to find value in handling all the complexity, a small or large seller, or individual would face when working with the financial system. They come to and stay with Square because we're so fast, simple and comprehensive. We strongly believe investing in this model will continue to set us apart and grow the number of people we get to serve.
And with that over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. Our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 highlight the momentum in our efforts to help existing customers grow to reach new customers and to build new products and services economic empowerment for sellers and individuals.
In the fourth quarter excluding Caviar, total net revenue grew 46% and gross profit grew 42% year-over-year exceeding our November guidance. For the full year, excluding Caviar, total net revenue grew 45% to $4.57 billion and gross profit grew 46% to $1.85 billion. We believe our results demonstrate that the strategic investments we are making are bearing fruit as we've continued to gain share while growing rapidly at scale.
Turning to our Seller ecosystem. In the fourth quarter, Seller generated $938 million of total net revenue and $379 million of gross profit, which increased 26% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. Seller delivered slightly higher gross profit growth in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. This was driven by broad-based performance.
Let's examine some of the dynamics. First as Jack mentioned, we changed the price of U.S. card-present transactions in the fourth quarter to better align with industry costs and we've seen encouraging retention rates of impacted customers. Though still early, we believe this is evidence of the compelling value we provide sellers.
Second, in the back half of 2019, we began investing more in go-to-market initiatives and saw favorable results following marketing campaigns with, which we tell a broader story about Square's ecosystem across software, hardware and financial services. The ecosystem campaign drove an uplift in awareness of Square's products along with a 30% uplift in web traffic year-over-year. This in turn drove both self on-boarding and lead generation for our sales teams. While the majority of new sellers still self on-board to Square, we are increasingly serving larger sellers through our sales team.
Sales accounted for 20% of new seller GPV in 2019, up from 12% in 2015. We expect contributions from our sales team to play a growing role in 2020 as we build out the team, increase productivity through data science tools and get the message out about our product innovations that enable us to serve the needs of larger and more complex sellers.
Square Capital was another driver of growth for the Seller ecosystem. We recently updated Capital's data science model, which enabled us to serve more loans to qualified sellers while maintaining loss rates of less than 4% on average.
Finally for Seller, we believe a key part of our future growth is international. Although relatively small for us today at 52% year-over-year growth in Q4, international is compounding at roughly 2x Seller's blended growth rate and has now delivered two consecutive quarters of faster year-over-year growth.
Turning to Cash App where we have seen healthy growth in monthly active customers as well as monetization per customer driven by our team's continued innovation around product features. In the fourth quarter, Cash App delivered $183 million in revenue excluding Bitcoin, up 96% year-over-year and $141 million in gross profit, up 101% year-over-year. Cash App's strong and sustained growth has led to a mix shift in our overall company gross profit with cash accounting for 27% of total gross profit in the fourth quarter compared to just 19% a year ago. Our teams are focused on driving regular engagement with our customers.
As Jack mentioned Cash App -- up 60% year-over-year and has added more new monthly actives each year since launch with December 2019 being its strongest month for new adds. Cash App daily active customers increased at an even faster clip of 80% year-over-year as we've enhanced discoverability and navigation to our products as well as added new products like equity investing.
Cash App has not only been growing, its engaged customer base to an impressive scale, but it has also driven consistent growth in revenue per customer over the past few years. In December, Cash App generated more than $30 in annualized revenue per monthly active customer excluding Bitcoin which more than doubled from less than $15 in December of 2017.
While, this is strong monetization for a consumer app, we believe we have room to grow further by continuing to increase the attach rate on Cash Card and further cross sell new products to come.
In both our seller and Cash App ecosystems, we've achieved compelling unit economics with strong retention and payback periods. This is a result of our ability to build and integrate remarkable products, find efficient channels for customer acquisition and deepen relationships with our customers over time. 2020 is an important year for us as we continue innovating and investing to bring new customers into both our ecosystems in the U.S. and globally.
Turning to our financial guidance for 2020, we expect to achieve total net revenue of $5.90 billion to $5.96 billion and gross profit of $2.44 billion to $2.475 billion or 34% year-over-year gross profit growth at the high end of the range excluding, Caviar. These figures are ahead of the preliminary expectations we shared on our third quarter call as the business has continued to execute at high-growth rates, even as we've scaled.
We expect our 2020 transaction profit margins as a percentage of GPV to be relatively stable compared to 1.08% in 2019 as we expect any benefit from the pricing change to be largely offset by mix shift to larger sellers. We expect to generate adjusted EBITDA between $500 million and $520 million consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided on our last call.
Similar to 2019, if we deliver topline outperformance during the year, we do not intend on increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance and instead plan on reinvesting that upside back into the business where we see opportunities to benefit long-term profitable growth.
Our EBITDA guidance includes strategic investments across both ecosystems including the previously outlined sales and marketing spend for our seller ecosystem which we expect to achieve a 4-quarter payback on our overall 2020 spend and to return multiples over time based on the strong returns we see.
Additionally as previously mentioned 2020 guidance includes a larger-than-normal facilities expansion related to our Oakland office, as well as additional regional offices which will add an incremental onetime step-up of $50 million to our operating expense base. Over the medium to long term we expect to continue to drive leverage from our G&A expenses as we have historically.
Finally, we're hosting our Investor Day on March 18 in San Francisco where we will provide a deeper update on our long-term vision, market opportunity, strategy and business model for the Seller and Cash ecosystem and long-term financial outlook.
I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. App numbers. Two quick ones on Cash App; first, given the fee pressure in the retail investing industry what's your monetization strategy for the new equity investing functionality? And then second what are the biggest benefits you're seeing from the new Cash App design as you've rolled it out in the last few months? Thanks Lisa. I'll start with the second question actually. We did -- as I mentioned in my remarks one of the things, we did last year was to clarify the navigation. And the goal of this was to increase the discoverability of our other services. The Cash Card, Bitcoin, which is also grouped with investing now and just provide a much more fluid and easy-to-access way to get some of the core functionality, that worked.
We did see increased discoverability. And the reason why that's important ultimately is the peer-to-peer network has a great reinforcing model in that, it grows as people just send and receive money. But as people see new features within the app such as investing, they tend to retain longer and we tend to see a lot of benefit from that usage as well.
So we started just going down that path, there's still potential work to do around the navigation to bring even more forth, but we're really happy with those results. As we've talked about in the past on these calls around any of these features, we have a lot of levers to pull in terms of whether we see them more as acquisition channels or areas for us to drive monetization and profit.
We want to be flexible with that. So this is something as we introduce these new adjacencies that give people more access to the financial network. We can evolve or change over time. The goal right now is to provide something that not a lot of people have had access to in the past, but also learn as much as possible so that we can then make better informed decisions. Just to add to that Lisa, when we look at products like investing what we see is very engaged customers who have the opportunity to do lots of things across the ecosystem. And that engagement in turn drives broader monetization. So in investing or Bitcoin active tends to generate 2x to 3x, the annual revenue compared to other cash customers that we see. And what you think about there is the seven different revenue streams that we have, the multiple ways that we have to add value to our customers and drive that daily utility which in turn results in seven different revenue streams that we have across Cash App that we can drive people to now that we have greater discoverability and navigation as well. Perfect. Thank you. Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for the presentation. I wanted to ask on the pricing side you -- just your pricing philosophy in general. We've seen fees go up for Instant Deposit and some prices down for Register and Terminal as you called out in the letter. So has your thinking around pricing changed as part of your investments in go to market? Thanks. Thank you. I'll start with this. I think just to remind folks of our early philosophy around price. One of the key differentiators for us in the early days of the company was the simplicity and more so the consistency of our price. So we started with 2.75%. This is important to merchants, because typically when they went to accept credit cards that rate was variable based on the card that their customers were using. So adding something that – presenting something that was stable that was transparent and that was upfront was really the philosophy independent of the particular number. That remains true today. We do see price as a lever for us and we want to make sure that we're balancing the needs of our customers, but also enabling us to fuel more of our work and building. Got it. No you guys pioneered that. See you guys next month. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question comes from Brendan O'Connor with Shareware Square [ph]. Hi. This is Brendan. I'm a Square seller from a small bakery called Flour & Salt Bakery up in upstate New York. My question is does Square have plans to develop a way for sellers to fulfill delivery orders so that small town businesses can run their own delivery service without relying on the big delivery companies that don't have local operators? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brendan and thanks for being our customer and using Square. This is actually a frequent request from our sellers, because we know that managing delivery orders is really difficult and complex and takes away time from you to really focus on your customers and making more sales.
If you use Square Online Store, we have Order Manager there. So when customers purchase something from your website and select delivery the order pops up in your point of sale, but we don't currently have a fleet management service or a way for buyers to track deliveries, but it's something that we're open and considering. And we also have a number of partners in the app marketplace that you can connect with that can help with those needs too. Yeah. Unfortunately, a lot of them aren't local to us, because we are in such a small town but I look forward to seeing you guys work on something for us in the future. Got it. Thank you so much. Your next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to maybe unpack 2020 guidance a little bit just given the growth rate and I think really the phase of the consumer and Seller ecosystems are at different points. Any kind of color, you can provide and just how we should be thinking about those businesses as we go through the year? Yeah happy to take that question Josh. So as you look at our 2020 guidance what we see here really is a reflection of the strong broad-based momentum that we have across both ecosystems coming out of Q4 and now in the early part of 2020. So you're looking at gross profit growth of 34% ex caviar at the high end, which is slightly ahead of our initial expectations on our November call. So to unpack that for you a little bit across Seller and Cash with Seller we expect stable gross profit growth consistent with the back half of 2019, which was roughly in the 26% range. And as you know, we're ramping our investments throughout the year in sales and marketing. So as we ramp those investments, we'd expect to see an impact to our top line numbers towards the end of 2020 as we ramp the spend and as we add new customer cohorts throughout the year, at the end of 2020 and into 2021.
On Cash App, we have grown this ecosystem rapidly. It now represents 27% of the overall company gross profit in the fourth quarter and on an annualized revenue run rate basis ex Bitcoin is at over $700 million in Q4. And so with triple-digit gross profit growth you're at 104% gross profit growth in the fourth quarter. Naturally, you'd expect to see those growth percentages come down over time.
In 2020, we still expect cash flow to drive sustained growth on a dollar basis. And this is again based on the durability of the business model that we have here in the power of compounding over time.
With respect to your question around phasing. In Q1, we tend to see a bit of seasonality around the Seller business, especially coming out of the holidays in Q4, with cash becoming a larger percentage of our business. So that has started to counteract that a little bit because we see less of that seasonality in cash. That's a little bit of the dynamics that we're seeing play out in terms of the phasing throughout the year. Very helpful. Thanks Amrita. Thank you. Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks guys. I just want to follow-up a bit on the Cash App monetization side, which was clearly impressive at about $30 per user I think you guys said. And I mean, it looks like it's around three times that of the revenue per user of your closest competitor has called out. So just maybe help us understand again the strategy that's enabling that other than maybe just pricing nuances. What's the opportunity? And what are you seeing consumers – how are they behaving around this app? Is it becoming that neobank to them yet that's enabling that? Is it still mostly Instant Deposit and Card and what else is to come? And then maybe just when we look at the gross margin of that I think it was around 70%. It was also pretty impressive. Can you just touch on the scale possible in that business versus the investments needed? Thanks guys. Sure. I can start on that Darrin. Thanks for the question. So just to break down kind of how the cash team – this team has a lot of gumption and they have really executed at a high level over the past few years. Just to break down a little bit about how that team focuses and what they're looking at. First and foremost, it's network growth. And you saw that this quarter ending the year at 24 million monthly active customers which is up 60% year-over-year. But even more importantly than that is the daily usage that the team is looking to drive through the launch of new products through things like the tabs redesign which really creates greater navigation to the broader ecosystem of products that we offer. And daily usage was up 80% year-over-year growing faster than the overall network. So we're proud of the work there and also proud that we've achieved this growth with relatively low cost of acquisition on paid marketing, which again is a result of that core feature around peer-to-peer transfer helping to bring in more customers at a relatively low cost efficient cost of acquisition.
From a cohort economic standpoint as you called out that $30 on a per customer basis that's across all monthly active customers has more than doubled since 2017. And there's another important step in that as well which we shared last quarter which is we see positive revenue retention for each of Cash's monthly cohorts of active customers since 2015. That's a similar dynamic that we've seen to the Seller business and again shows that we're able to efficiently acquire customers keep them engaged on increasingly a daily basis and then offer them additional ways that we can add value and therefore monetize across the ecosystem. Yeah. And I just would want to point out that this is where the ecosystem model really works well for us. We don't see that with the other neobanks. We have a very strong foundation in utility in peer-to-peer, which allows us to introduce folks to various aspects of new functionality within the app itself. And that spreads through word of mouth as well.
We also benefit from some really creative and highly impactful marketing that the team does do. We've just -- the team has kind of rethought how to think -- how to bring a product and features into the market in the first place and we also benefit a lot from all the songs that are out there that have Cash App either in the name or in the lyrics. All right. Thanks guys. Thank you Your next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. So, Amrita a question for you on investments. Clearly lots of good opportunity for you to invest across omnichannel, international, sales and marketing, new products Cash App. As you sort of look into your guidance for 2020, what are the two or three big investment areas that you've planned for this year beyond sort of like increased sales and marketing spend on the Seller business as you had articulated before?
And then more broadly how do you think about balancing incremental investment dollars between Cash App which is really fast growing versus Seller business which is majority of your revenue today? Sure. Happy to take that question Harshita. We are focused on growing the two ecosystems in 2020 across not only products. We think of product innovation as driving long-term growth for us in TAM expansion and being able to serve new -- customers in new ways.
And then secondly, as you mentioned, in sales and marketing, which helps us scale those products helps us reach customers not only in the U.S. where we are distributed today, but also in a number of markets around the world.
So, we continue to be focused on investing in both of those areas; product development to make sure we're serving our customers through feature enhancements today as well as new ways to serve them in the future, as well as sales and marketing which is then helping to scale those products by reaching more customers in new ways.
With respect to how we balance investments across Seller and Cash, we think about first what the needs are independently across each business and the ways that we can best serve our customers be it sellers or individuals in each of those businesses. And then we think about ways that the rising tide can lift all boats and we can eventually create ways that benefits in one area can return results in another area as well.
So, we -- and we've luckily been able to do this historically by delivering compounding scaled growth in the Seller business, while creating an entirely new ecosystem organically with Cash App at the same time in a matter of three or four years. That's now at a more than $700 million run rate. So, we don't see it as an either/or with the two ecosystems. We believe that we can drive growth and investment dollars in both of them. Thank you. Your next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi guys. Wanted to ask about the change in pricing in instant transfer. Do you expect some churn in that channel and a resulting pickup in Cash Card? Just thinking about the impact in the P&L.
And then I have to ask the obvious question on coronavirus. Any impact you're seeing -- I doubt you're seeing anything on consumer spending in U.S., but how about international markets like Australia and Japan? Thanks. Hey Bryan. So, you're right, in early January, we announced a pricing change on seller instant transfer from 1% to 1.5%. We felt that now that sellers have the free alternative on Square Card that gives them instant access to their funds. We felt the timing was right to reconsider the pricing on instant transfer because with Square Card, not only do they have access instantly to their own funds, but it encourages sellers to keep their funds within the Square ecosystem and to use and explore our ecosystem.
Now, with respect to the P&L, this price change is already contemplated in our 2020 guidance included in that 34% gross profit growth ex-Caviar at the high end. We expect the change to be accretive in 2020 to total net revenue and gross profit growth, but it's going to be small we believe relative to the size of the Seller business. Remember, we had $1.4 billion in annual gross profit in 2019.
And then your second question was on coronavirus? Yes, just the impact. I mean any impact in U.S. consumer spending I doubt it, but curious on any impact on international markets. Sure. In short, we didn't see any material impact in our Q4 results as you can see, nor do we expect a material impact in Q1 for our results. When you look across the Seller and Cash ecosystems today, we continue to see healthy trends in performance. We have sellers in a variety of industries on our platform and we're actually under-indexed to tourism. Although, of course, we'll continue to monitor any impact to the overall consumer spend numbers that we see. Helpful. Thanks so much. Of course. Your next question comes from Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thanks guys. So, I want to touch on an important aspect of Cash App and that will be direct deposit. With the recent app redesign and then also some of the stuff that you are doing around Payroll and/or Caviar and DoorDash, is there anything you could let us know in terms of direct deposit penetration or trends or maybe plans going forward? We -- so with direct deposit, this is another area that we saw an opportunity to serve more the needs that people would typically go to a bank branch for and again like just removing as much friction as possible, so they don't have to think about the financial system in any way. This is certainly one ATM card -- the Cash Card being used at ATMs is another such example, build a way so that we can fit in people's lives every single day, instead of just being a weekly occurrence.
So, as we look at features like that we're always looking for opportunities through the app first party or through partnership. But it's a good entry point for us and for our customers so that they can see us more and more as the way to manage their access to the financial system and for us to remove a bunch of that complexity. We're still pretty early in understanding what those use cases are ultimately and where it goes, but we intend to learn as we see more and more usage around it. Hey thank you very much. Your next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Thank you. Good evening. Thanks for the question. A lot to like here. I was just hoping if we could talk a little bit about the Square Capital changes to the system there, perhaps if you could describe a little bit more in detail some of the factors that help you open up that product to more of the seller base and whether you're seeing any changes in like origination economics for Square. Thank you. Hey, Pete thanks for the question. So we recently updated our capital risk model to capture what we would call additional signals, which help us better optimize various loan attributes. Think of it like term length or repayment amount for sellers. Those signals improve our ability to monitor key themes like ability to repay and likelihood of fraudulent activity that in turn then helps us determine creditworthiness.
And this credit – this update to our risk model was a key driver of Capital's outperformance in the fourth quarter as it resulted in larger loans to our most creditworthy sellers.
And I think it's part of a broader theme here of our access to proprietary real-time data where we are able to continuously improve Capital's machine learning models. And this is what's enabled us to maintain stable loss rates below 4% on average for our core flex loan product since 2017 even as originations have roughly doubled. And in the fourth quarter we saw some of the benefits of that. Capital generated $671 million in originations on a dollar basis up 42% year-over-year with revenues up even higher because of the strong investor demand that we see here. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question tonight. How should we think about the kind of horizon of your marketing investment? Should we expect a certain point in time where we sort of lap a period of heavy investment? Or should we think of some of this as a more kind of permanent addition to the expense structure in nature? And then just as a bolt-on to that Jack you talked last quarter about combining the Seller and Cash ecosystems. I'm just wondering how your thinking along those lines has evolved since we last spoke. Ramsey I'll take the first part of your question on how we think about the horizons for our marketing investments. What we really look at more than anything here is the efficiency metrics. And so you've heard us talk about things like payback period being in that 4-quarter range. What we saw in Q4 even with the beginning of the ramp of the spend here is we believe consistent with that 4-quarter payback. And in 2020 with the incremental investments that we're making again we expect a four-quarter payback.
But the other key metric that we'd look at is ROI return on investment and that captures the overall lifetime value of a seller. As we're able to reach more and more large and complex sellers who we know take on generally more products within the Square ecosystem we have the opportunity to expand lifetime value for these customers and therefore even with increased spend on sales and marketing to see very, very compelling ROI.
So what we plan to continue to do is ramp the spend, optimize as we go and measure these results to ensure that we continue to see this ROI. And with the unit economics that we have in the seller ecosystem where we have positive revenue retention what that means is that each seller that we bring in effectively has the ability to grow on our platform and to become an annuity stream. So we believe that that's the dynamic that we'd – that our investors would want us to invest behind. And we have an incredible advantage over our peers in this industry because of the two ecosystems that we're building: one seller focused and also focusing on their customers but Cash App up as well. Pairing both of them together is quite powerful. We see this in a few ways.
One, we benefit from a lot of the internal collaboration and intersections. A lot of what we've learned from Cash App has informed some of the products and features within the Seller business and vice versa. So that gives us ability to learn very, very quickly from two ecosystems at scale.
And we do think there's a lot of opportunity in the future to connect them from a external customer-facing experience perspective. We have done this in the past. Most notably – or probably a good example of this is Payroll. So employees can actually utilize the Payroll feature to get paid via Cash App, which is excellent. We saw this in the past with carriers when we had Caviar as well. So there's a number of points between the two ecosystems that you can imagine us continuing to explore and building something around. Right now we're learning what the most impactful ones of those are starting small and then building up as we learn more from it. Perfect. Than you so much. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks, guys. I just had two on Cash App, so I'll ask them upfront. The first is on Cash Card itself. I think you said that it's only being used by about 20% of monthly actives currently. I would just be curious to know what that number maybe looked like a year ago and what kind of headroom you see in that number as you look forward. And then just second can you give us a sense of how much the Boost rewards program is currently pressuring revenue and what the prospects are for more of that to move into a merchant-funded model over time? Jason I'll take those questions. So on Cash Card you did hear the 20% stat. We're at over 20% attached rate on Cash Card. The last absolute number we gave you as of June was 3.5 million monthly actives. But as we've grown the base of Cash monthly actives more broadly since June, obviously we've also ramped Cash Card active and since June as well.
So to your question about how has attached looked over the past year that is something that has grown over time as we've been able to prove out the value to our customers and fast access to these funds and through products like Boost and as we've been able to create better discoverability and navigation around products like Cash Card.
Our Cash Card actives are transacting multiple times a week so we know it's a key part of that daily engagement, daily utility that we're driving with Cash App more broadly. It's also a key part of that revenue per customer that we outlined this quarter at $30 in December of 2019 versus $15 two years ago when Cash Card was still in its infancy.
With respect to your question on Boost. The numbers that we report for revenue already take out the Boost cost. So revenue ex Bitcoin being $183 million in the fourth quarter already nets out our Boost costs. We as a team is very active in how we manage Boost and has actually innovated on Boost quite a bit over this past year doing things like lockBoosts and expiring Boost and geo-located Boosts so creating different ways to create engagement around Boost and create timeliness around Boost which also have the added benefit of creating an expense management mechanism for us around Boost as well. So it's a growth lever for us but it's also one that we can actively manage. Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for taking my question guys. Just had a question on the ILC application. Any update you could provide there? And then within that context of another fintech going out and purchasing a bank, are you thinking any differently around sort of the build-versus-buy strategy, and maybe the need for an ILC application versus just buying, I guess, more of a traditional corporate bank, thank you -- commercial bank? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We -- no update on the ILC process and progress. We will certainly keep you informed as we have more. In terms of -- I think it's important to remember why we're doing this in the first place. This is not something our business is dependent upon, but creates a number of opportunities of efficiency.
And we would certainly look at other potential options, but this is one that feels right to potentially create more efficiencies, but again no dependency on it. So we haven't focused on other considerations. Your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks, and good evening. I just had a quick question as it pertains in aggregate to the guidance for 2020. And it's really more a function of how much flexibility do you -- have you built into that given maybe some concerns around the economy if we run into some bumps, and you guys have to throttle back or toggle a little bit on these investments that you're making. Would you still envision if you didn't make those investments that you would have this type of growth trajectory that you guys are on? And I'm just thinking in terms of your ability to throttle back on some of those expenses to the extent that we run into some more difficult times? Thanks. Thanks for the question Dan. So I'd start at a high level and just say that nothing has changed with respect to our guidance philosophy, which is to use as much as we know about the business to inform our outlook in future periods. And again, we're coming into 2020 with strong broad-based momentum across both Seller and Cash in multiple ways within each of those ecosystems. So that's really what's informing our guide.
With respect to flexibility, of course, we find ways to build in flexibility in terms of how we manage the business. And that's through weekly reviews, monthly reviews across each of the key spend areas, whether it's hiring or sales and marketing spend to ensure that we're using the levers in an optimal way and that we can pivot as needed based on what we see in the market or based on the returns and efficiencies we see across various channels. That's great. Thank you. Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is opne. Thank you. I just wanted to ask two quick follow-ups related to questions that have previously been asked. First, you talked about a bit of acceleration in your international markets particularly on Seller, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you can give some additional color as to what you're seeing in those -- which markets and kind of what you think is driving that acceleration and how we should think about contribution from that?
And my second question goes back to the ILC. And it sounds like at least for the time being you're not feeling limited. But if you had style figures or some other sort of banking charter and license do you think you could accelerate faster or further your Cash App and associated services? Thank you. Well, I'll answer the second question first. So I don't believe that would necessarily be the case. So we're in an extremely good position. I'm really happy with our progress pace and speed and our ability to work in very, very creative ways with partners, so that we don't have to be everything in order to provide a really compelling customer experience.
So in terms of global acceleration, I think a high-level driver is we're launching. We're launching a lot more of our products into the markets that we're currently in. So we launched Square Terminal in Australia, Canada and the U.K. We launched Square for Restaurants in the U.K. and Australia. And we continue to experiment with Cash in the U.K. so that we can better inform how we think about expanding the Cash App as well. But launches are meaningful. So the more we complete our ecosystem in all the markets we're in look for opportunities to go into new markets it definitely benefits us in terms of usage. And James on international, I'd add that, it's pretty broad-based in terms of the performance that we're seeing. Do want to caution it's still small today, right? So international Q4 GAAP revenue was $75 million, but it's growing rapidly. It's growing at 2x the rate of the broader Seller business at 52% year-over-year in Q4, and we've seen two straight quarters of improving growth rates there.
And another key piece of it, as Jack mentioned, we're launching new products. We're attracting new sellers and the revenue contribution from new seller cohorts, we feel is a leading indicator of growth and it is growing faster in international markets than in the U.S. with international now contributing over 10% of seller -- new seller GPV in the fourth quarter. So we're happy with the momentum that we're seeing there. Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Amrita. Thank you. Thanks. Your next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Thank you. Nice execution. Question on your omni-channel strategy. It's been over a year since you acquired Weebly. And Jack, I think, you're -- one of the things that you increase in marketing is to increase awareness of products and so you have the omni-channel strategy with the online store trying to show that your software runs the whole business. So I was just wondering on the progress of that omni-channel strategy and then with expanding customer usage of your software to run the full business maybe more like what Shopify may be doing? Yes. Thanks for the question Bob. I think first and foremost the most important thing to point out here that really sets us apart is Square Online store supports all types of businesses. We're not just focused on retail. We handle restaurants. We handle services. And it's all through the same interface that brings the entire business together, whether it's online or through apps or through marketplaces or offline transactions as well.
And the reason why I called that out is, because a lot of the newer businesses that we're seeing are crossing over from these categories. So we have retailers who also provide services and restaurants who also handle -- do retail-type things and restaurants doing more services as well.
So I think that is what is compelling about our model, but it really sets us apart from all of our peers as well. And again, that leads back to this ecosystem model that we've been building. So we are making a bunch of progress on it, but we -- it's worth noting that we're not limiting ourselves to one category of seller. And we want to make sure that we're managing for all the flexibility of how businesses and merchants and sellers evolve over time, because that will ultimately lead them to drive more sales. Just to add to that, Bob, your question about progress on fixed that we are encouraged by an early metric, is that Square Online Store is becoming an entry point into the broader seller ecosystem. And it's driving a similar amount of net new sellers to Square, as other products like point of sale.
So you can have a seller who's already a part of the Seller ecosystem and possibly has a shop and now wants to expand online and they're joining Square Online Store. But you also have net new sellers who are coming online with us through Square Online Store and are joining the Square ecosystem as a part of that. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Our last question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor. Your line is open. Hi. I was just -- and I don't want to take anything away from the Analyst Day and give you an opportunity to plug it as well. But on the Cash App side, I was wondering, could you give us a little bit of color, maybe a sneak preview on what the next functionality for that app is going to be? And then just on the margin profile of that business, any thoughts around time frame and when you might think about when it might scale? Thanks. Well, we hope to see you at Analyst Day, so we can give you all that color and not surprise anyone. But I think, generally from a high level what we talked about during the opening remarks is the model that we follow. And that is, we have a really compelling self-reinforcing model where people can grow the network just simply by sending and receiving money. And we see markers of this all the time. Just looking at the App Store on a Friday, which is payday for a lot of people within this country, sends us up the charts very quickly.
So we've traditionally looked at what are the most critical needs that we can also add as adjacencies that also reinforce the peer-to-peer aspect and that the peer-to-peer aspect allows us to do. So that's how we came up with storing money in Card and that led to ATMs and direct deposit, which all led to Bitcoin and investing.
So we kind of just look at all the opportunities out there that would fit within this ecosystem and also reinforce it and make judgments based off that. But I'm really happy not just with the breadth of what the Cash App team has been able to do, but also the quality and the creativity in their approach. It has netted out to be an immensely enjoyable experience, but also is really impactful for the people that we're serving from a very mainstream audience in this country to folks who have not had access to the financial system in the past. And I would just add on your question on margin profile, it's important to remember that three-and-a-half years ago Cash App had de minimis revenues and we really started monetizing this business in the past three to four years. And we're now looking at an ecosystem that has 24 million monthly active customers and over $700 million a year revenue run rate ex-Bitcoin.
So this team has ramped very quickly, as Jack said, by ramping its products and its customer focus. And in terms of margin, each of the years that we have been monetizing over the past three years, we've also seen margin improvements in each of those years. And we expect to just see the same in 2020. So our focus today, first and foremost, is to continue to scale this business and get it in the hands of more customers, with even more product functionality. Thank you. Thank you.

I would like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. First, we want to remind everyone of the format of our earnings call, we have published a shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website, which was available shortly after the market close. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our sellers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we’ll be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statement. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
During the call, we’ll be describing preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of April. These represent our current estimate for April performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of April and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual April results may differ from these estimates.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Additionally, as a reminder, we will we discontinue the use of adjusted revenue in the third quarter of 2019.
Following receipt of a comment letter from and discussions with the SEC, our statement of operations continues to disclose total net revenue, transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs determined in accordance with GAAP, which are the key components of adjusted revenue. There are no changes to any other GAAP or non-GAAP metrics. We have posted a spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website with our historical financials and additional details related to our income statement.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We’re going to start with a few remarks from me and Amrita, and then we’ll get to your questions. Before we begin, I want to share our gratitude for all those on the frontlines fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We will not be able to do our work without the sacrifices you make every moment to do yours. Thank you to our healthcare workers and everyone providing essential services around the world to keep us all healthy and safe. We acknowledge and we appreciate you.
We’ve seen our customers rise to the occasion too. While shelter-in-place orders have slowed foot traffic to our sellers, they found new ways to keep the doors open, retain staff and serve customers. Retailers, wine shops and QSRs launched online ordering by building websites in less than a day for delivery and curbside pickup. Larger full-service restaurants opened community markets to sell raw ingredients, produce, and food staples through online stores even Michelin Star restaurants like Chez Panisse in Berkeley.
Distilleries and tailors shifted to selling personal protective equipment like hand sanitizer and masks. Hair dressers and beauticians moved to video appointments to advise on self-styling. Over the past six weeks, we’ve also seen Cash App customers come together like never before. Folks are donating the strangers in need through social media, fundraising for charities, small businesses and churches, and tipping artists doing online performances. Artists like Luna FX and Jeffree Star asked people to post their cashtags, so they can send their fans money. Diddy hosted a 12-hour danceathon to help raise money for healthcare workers by pinning the cashtag DiddyDanceathon to his Instagram live all funds go into direct relief.
In March, we look critically at our roadmaps and decided to quickly reprioritize our work to advance some initiatives, originally slated later in the year. Within two weeks of the first shelter-in-place orders, we launched curbside pickup and delivery options in the Square Online Store and made them free for all sellers. We eliminated fees for our software products in March and April, and launched a way for sellers to pause these subscriptions to help them cut cost temporarily and quickly unpause them when they rebound. We launched a gift card portal to help buyers search for Square sellers in their neighborhoods to continue to support them.
We launched a simple resource hub with information and advice, and gave our account management customer support and sales teams’ information to enable them to better help our sellers. As the CARES Act stimulus was being drafted and finalized, teams across both our Seller and Cash App ecosystems moved fast to help sellers and individuals get access to government support as quickly as possible.
First, Square Capital secured SBA approval to offer PPP loans. We’ve built a new product that remove complexity from the PPP process by enabling sellers to quickly move through a simple application form. So far we’ve submitted $855 million in verified applications on behalf of 54,000 sellers and approximately, $520 million has been approved by the SBA to 45,000 sellers. The average loan size to businesses in all 50 states is $12,000. 50% of the applicants were sole proprietors, 40% were employers.
Cash App published straightforward FAQs to help folks understand the stimulus program and instructions on how to get their money fast, doubling our web traffic overnight. From there, we worked with our partner banks to expand direct deposit access for Cash App customers, making it easy for people to get their money deposited directly, so they could send it to family or friends or use it to purchase whatever they need with their Cash Card. In four weeks, the number of Cash App customers with direct deposit access grew from 3 million to 14 million.
Now more than ever, we see the strength and value of our ecosystem strategy. It comes down to speed and trust. Our tools have been – have proven to be simple enough that anyone current or new customers can quickly pick them up and adapt to many different challenges they may meet. And we have shown that we aren’t just here to provide tools, but help and support navigating complexity safely. This is a transformative moment, and as a business, we have made the strategic decision to invest through this challenge to come out on the other side in the position of strength.
We see significant opportunity to bring new sellers and individuals into our ecosystems, and build and launch new products to serve them both today and long-term. And while we slowed non-essential hiring, we believe this is a unique opportunity to find great people. So, we’ve prioritized critical roles to help us. We’re working on something foundational to society and we’re really proud of our agility and heart through these times.
Thanks to all of our customers, our employees and you for the trust as we continue to build and serve. And with that, over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. I hope you all are safe and healthy with your families during this time. And I echo Jack’s comments with gratitude for those on the frontlines of this pandemic. There are three key items, which I’d like to share with you today. First, on our first quarter results, we achieved strong growth in January and February prior to the significant slowdown in our Seller business in the last two weeks of March. Second, on trends in April, we saw early signs of potential stabilization and improvement in our Seller ecosystem with continued strong momentum in Cash App. Third, we believe it’s now more important than ever to invest behind our mission of economic empowerment and service of our customers.
First, I’ll look at our overall first quarter results. We achieved strong growth in January and February prior to the slowdown in Seller in the last two weeks of March. Overall, in the first quarter, gross profit was $539 million, up 36% year-over-year or 40% growth year-over-year excluding Caviar. These growth rates are about 10 points lower than what we observed through January and February prior to the impact of COVID-19.
Our Seller ecosystem gross profit grew 18% year-over-year in the first quarter. This includes the last two weeks of March, where Seller GPV decelerated sharply to a decline of 39% year-over-year. Card-present volumes were down approximately 60% year-over-year in the last two weeks of March, while card-not-present volumes were less affected. Additionally, we refunded all March software subscription fees for our sellers to support them during the COVID-19 pandemic. And beginning in mid-March, we paused new core flex loan offers for Square Capital given lower visibility in this disruptive time.
Cash App delivered impressive growth in the first quarter with gross profit up 115% year-over-year. While we saw a modest deceleration in peer-to-peer volumes in Cash Card spend from COVID-19 in March, overall growth remained strong with Cash App gross profit up 112% year-over-year in March. A key driver remained efficient new customer acquisition. In March and then again, in April, Cash App set new highs for its number of net new monthly transacting actives. For our bitcoin and stock brokerage products, the market volatility helped increase adoption and drive strong volume growth during the quarter.
Turning to profitability, net loss was $106 million and adjusted EBITDA was $9 million during the first quarter with two key factors to call out. First, the primary impact in the quarter was a significant increase in reserves for transaction in loan losses, which reflected an estimate for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on future losses related this Seller transaction processing and Square Capital. We recognized actual losses could vary based on severity and duration of the impact of COVID-19. The second lesser factor was the slowdown in high margin revenue in our Seller ecosystem in the last two weeks of March.
The macroeconomic environment we are experiencing is unlike anything we have seen. Our focus is on our customers and communities that have been meaningfully impacted. We also recognized there could be a wide range of outcomes for our financial results in the second quarter and the remainder of the year depending on the length and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, we are not providing second quarter full year revenue or earnings financial guidance at this time.
Instead, we wanted to share with you what we are seeing in real-time with an update on business trends from April, including early signs of potential stabilization and improvement in Seller GPV with continued momentum in Cash App. In our Seller ecosystem, we expect gross profit to be down approximately 35% year-over-year in April. Seller GPV was down 39% year-over-year in April. While we saw a decline of approximately 45% year-over-year from the last week of March through the first half of April as trend line stabilized at these levels, we have seen improving growth rates since mid-April. We recognize it’s still early and we continue to see daily volatility, but we’ve been encouraged by these recent trends.
We believe this improvement coincides with a few potential factors. One, existing sellers adapting as they shift to omnichannel commerce. Two, acquisition of new sellers. Three, the timing of Easter. And four, a benefit from government stimulus efforts. While GPV from in-person activity was down significantly year-over-year in April, card-not-present GPV achieved positive year-over-year growth, as we saw sellers adapt their businesses and leverage many of our omnichannel offerings.
Square Online Store was an area of strong growth in acquisition with weekly GPV up more than 5X since mid-March and with the strongest adoption by sellers in two of the hardest hit verticals; food and drink and retail. Notably, we saw over two-thirds of Square Online Store GPV come from our recently launched pickup and delivery service. Additionally, we have taken measures to support our customers and protect our companies through COVID-19, measures that will impact Seller top-line results in the second quarter, but we believe benefit us and our customers for the long-term. We waived subscription fees for our sellers in April and offered the option to pause subscription billing temporarily to allow our sellers to better manage costs.
For Square Capital, while we paused offers for new core flex loans, we intend to reopen flex loan origination where we see stability in the coming weeks and months. As you heard from Jack, we started distributing loans in the second round of PPP. While there is a tremendous amount of work happening here to support our sellers, we don’t expect capital to contribute materially to revenue and gross profit in the second quarter.
Turning to cash outperformance in April where we expect gross profit growth of over 100% year-over-year. Cash App’s strong performance was broad-based as we achieved our highest monthly totals for net new transacting active, peer-to-peer volume, Cash Card spend, new direct deposit transacting active, bitcoin and stock brokerage volumes and stored funds. After modest initial deceleration in late March, Cash App peer-to-peer volumes and Cash Card spend improved during the first half of April as we saw customers seek new used cases for sending money and shift commerce to e-commerce channels.
During the second half of April, the CARES Act stimulus programs helps drive even stronger growth across various Cash App products. In particular, we saw strong adoption of direct deposit and Cash App customers compared to March. April direct deposit volumes grew by 3X and new direct deposit transacting actives grew by 4X. This helped drive customers to store more than $1.3 billion in aggregate cash balances during the month, which roughly doubled compared to the beginning of January and was up 1.4 times month-over-month. While we are encouraged by Cash App’s results in April, we will continue to monitor how customer behavior normalizes post stimulus in this dynamic macro environment.
Turning to my final topic, our investment framework and key factors that impact profitability. First, as I mentioned earlier, we have high incremental margins in our Seller business. As a result, decreases in Seller gross profit will largely flow through to profitability. Second, transaction in loan losses in future quarters are determined by two primary inputs; actual losses on first quarter volumes, which could prove higher or lower than our first quarter results and estimates for expected losses on volumes generated in subsequent periods. Both of these inputs may vary depending on the length and severity of COVID-19 impact. As it relates to second quarter volumes, we and our sellers have taken steps to mitigate risks in this new macro environment, but this is an area we continue to watch closely.
Third, while we have reviewed our operating expenses and taken steps to pull back discretionary expenses where appropriate, we believe it is now more important than ever to invest in our mission of economic empowerment and service to both sellers and individuals. We have pulled back certain non-essential spend around Seller marketing, hiring for non-critical positions, facilities build-out, travel, company events and other discretionary expenses, leading to an expected reduction in 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses of $75 million to $125 million compared to our initial expectations for 2020 product development, sales and marketing and G&A.
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP, product development, sales and marketing and G&A in aggregate to be in line with first quarter spend. We intend to pursue originally planned Cash App investment given strong performance, and as a reminder, a large portion of Cash App’s operating expenses such as P2P costs are non-discretionary and expected to scale along with the growth of the platform.
While we are being appropriately deliberate with our investments in our Seller ecosystem, we’ve seen encouraging early signs of attractive returns on marketing that can lead us to add back investment to reach new customers. We deferred our global brand campaign and shifted our sales and marketing messages to prioritize targeted omnichannel products and multi-product awareness campaigns. We saw early signs, early results in mid-March and April that indicate the quality of new sellers improved from pre-COVID levels as recent cohorts of sellers were larger on both the volume and gross profit basis.
We believe our Seller ecosystem is significantly differentiated, especially in times like these. Our portfolio of products enables sellers to quickly move between offline and online commerce in an integrated and seamless manner, speed up money movement and communicate with buyers in a way that few other companies can offer.
For Cash App, this is a unique moment, in which new customer – consumer-driven commerce habits are taking shape. The Cash App team is focused on crafting new experiences with a demonstrated product velocity that hasn’t flowed in this time of great disruption. Jack mentioned our teams’ efforts around the stimulus, the resulting inflection on direct deposit is meaningful. Direct deposit customers have generated revenue which is multiples higher compared to customers who only use peer-to-peer.
As Cash App was added more products, we’ve expanded the addressable market opportunity as customers have increased their adoption of those products, their lifetime value has increased, which has driven improvements in Cash App’s profitability over time, and we believe it is still early days.
Finally, our strong balance sheet with $3.4 billion in liquidity at the end of the first quarter and a recently upsized revolver, affords us the opportunity to be deliberate and long-term-oriented as we invest. The work we do to serve our customers has never been more urgent or important. We believe the investments we make today to support our existing customers amplify our go-to-market approach reaching new customers and strategically and selectively hire great talent will enable us to emerge stronger as we look ahead to a recovery
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Great, thanks. Thanks so much for this data. I wanted to ask, I think you sort of touched upon, both of you did, just how you’re approaching risk management on the Seller side both for Square Capital and underwriting in general? It sounds like you are skewing a little bit bigger, which is helping on the quality as you suggested. So just anything else to add to that? And then also just to clarify, because I’m getting some questions on it. The first quarter EBITDA, how much was driven by the higher loss reserve? And I presume that should stabilize if the volumes stabilize. And looking ahead, is it fair to apply a decremental margin that look like your incremental margin when things are going well, I think that was in the 60s. All else equal, is that a good starting point to think about that all else equal? Thank you. Hey, Tien-Tsin. I can start this off. Maybe I’ll start us off with your second question around EBITDA impact for the first quarter and then we can tackle the rest of your questions. With respect to EBITDA in the first quarter, which was $9 million, there were two primary impacts. The larger of the impact was related to risk loss reserves, which we will speak to in a moment. The lesser of the impact was the top-line impact and the flow through to margin there. As you noted, high incremental margins on our Seller business, which benefits us obviously as revenues grow. And then we saw the impact in the other direction in terms of decremental margins in the last two weeks of the quarter for Q1.
Q1 ex-risk loss, EBITDA would have been up. Even with the impact of the last two weeks of March, EBITDA would have been up 30% year-over-year. The risk loss clearly is the larger impact for Q1. And let me talk through some of the puts and takes with respect to our transaction and loan losses and then we can see if there is more of your question that I’ve missed. So with respect to transaction and loan losses, we booked $109 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by the Seller transaction processing volume in the first quarter, along with our capital loans on balance sheet of just over $160 million. And the way you can look at that is for both of those two areas, the reserve that we took, which is an estimate at this point, the reserve that we took is about 4X higher than the prior quarterly run rate on a dollar basis. So think of Q4. What we took in Q1 was about 4X higher.
And to give you a sense of what we’re tracking, we watch charge backs on the Seller side related to non-delivery of goods as one indicating – leading indicator of losses. And what we’ve seen so far in charge backs is actually less than 2X normal levels. However, we know that what we see here is very much dependent on what happens in terms of the duration and severity of the COVID impacts and that we could see additional losses. Hence, we set a provision in reserve that’s 4X the typical levels.
On the capital business, similar sort of approach. $22 million provision on the capital loans on our balance sheet, which is about 4X the prior run rate on a dollar basis, but only about 2.5X from a loss rate basis. And similarly, seeing lower in terms of current repayment flows than what we actually booked in the expectation that there would be further impact from COVID.
And to your question, we have taken risk mitigating measures to manage our exposure in this very dynamic time. Some of the things that we’ve done on the Seller business are manage our exposure related to higher risk sellers, including assessing some of the industries and products that have been releasing disputes, managed our sellers, for instance, SMS reminders to help assess Square Contract Service, which is a legal framework for extended payment terms.
On the capital side, we’ve paused core flex loan originations for now. But as we see stabilization across verticals, across geos and plan to reopen our core flex loan product in the coming weeks and months. And in terms of the future outlook here in terms of risk loss, there are a number of puts and takes, obviously that I mentioned in the intro remarks, there’s the actual losses that flow through in Q1, which could be higher or lower than the reserve assumptions that we have made, there’s future GPV level, and there’s the mix of products that we serve and the mix of verticals and then there is these actions that we’re taking to mitigate our risks as we look forward. So this is an area that could be variable, but we’re very, very focused on monitoring here and taking proactive measures to manage our risk. The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller [Wolfe Research]. Your line is open. Hey, thanks guys. Glad to hear you’re all doing okay. Look, first just addressing the questions we get around the resilience of your customers. Is there any early indications you can give us into sense merchants that – the numbers that are managing through this versus perhaps not maybe the mix of merchants we should expect on the other side of this? And then really more importantly looking through 2020, you guys clearly have some of the better omnichannel technology. So can you comment on the kind of inbounds you’re getting from your merchants to help them with your tech and omnichannel? And what does that mean for market share for Square versus the industry on the other side of it? Hey there. I’ll start us off on what we’re seeing to start and then Jack can jump in on where we believe our ecosystem is differentiated. So what we’re seeing so far in terms of the diversity of our ecosystem, because you’re right, we serve a variety of verticals, we serve across a number of geographies, some with shelter-in-place measures, most with shelter-in-place measures and some that are easing both domestically and internationally, and we serve a variety of products across our ecosystem.
So, let me try to tease apart bit of what we’re seeing across all of that. At the aggregate level, what we saw in the back half of March and then through April was Seller GPV down 39% year-over-year, but it’s important to tease apart the nuances when you look on a week-by-week basis. The last week of March and the first half of April was down about 45% year-over-year. In the back half of April, we’ve seen improvement that has rebounded above that blended 39% year-over-year number. We believe it’s driven by three main factors.
First, existing sellers adapting to contactless commerce and we’ll talk through some of the products that we have that have really served our sellers in this time and enabled them to stay open and interacting with their buyers. We’ve seen new sellers join our platform in this time because of the differentiated aspects of our ecosystem. And we’ve seen the impact of both the timing of Easter and the potential impact from the government stimulus programs, which have really started taking effect in mid-April.
From a commerce type perspective, which really speaks to the breadth of our ecosystem, we have seen positive year-over-year growth in our card-not-present products as sellers have adapted to contactless commerce solutions. And now card-not-present products, which used to account for about a third of our volumes, now account for well over 50% of our GPV in April.
Some of the key outperformance to point out here include the online store, which since the launch of curbside pickup and Seller power delivery, I mentioned, our weekly GPV on the online store is about 5X what we had seen earlier in Q1. As sellers are shifting their approach to contactless options, additionally, virtual terminal and invoices both achieved positive year-over-year growth, which may be partly related to the less impact we’ve seen in the services vertical, which really makes use of that product.
From a market standpoint or a geographic standpoint, we’ve seen a variety of outcomes across international markets, Australia interestingly, which has had the most success in reducing COVID cases is our first market, was our first market to return to positive year-over-year growth in the past 10 days that we’ve seen growth rates stabilize in that positive range. And we have also seen, as I mentioned, in some of the states in the U.S. that in late April started easing shelter-in-place restrictions, early data that indicates a stronger uplift in those states versus the states with shelter-in-place measures in place. We only have a week of data so far and obviously there is a lot to look at here, a lot of considerations around health metrics and otherwise. But this is an area that we will continue to monitor.
Across the diversity of our Seller base, and as you noted, we serve sellers across every vertical, millions of businesses and widespread across the U.S. in particular. We’ve seen impacts from COVID-19 in a number of different ways. While all industries have experienced year-over-year declines in GPV, the services vertical, as I mentioned, like home and repair and professional services has been the most resilient. And we’ve seen verticals that have been hard hit like food and beverage and retail make use of those omnichannel products that I was mentioning earlier.
By seller size, so maybe my final point before Jack chimes in, by seller size all five segments were impacted. Micro sellers’ growth declines are now more comparable to larger sellers, but what you see with micros is both higher churn and higher same store sales growth. So still, nuance across the system, but serve a diversity across verticals, geographies and products. Hey, Darrin. Hope you’re well. Yes. So, we are seeing a lot of opportunity here. We are seeing sellers switch to Square from our competitors because of the omnichannel ecosystem. In terms of inbound, so the first and foremost was just how do I run my business online, and we were able to quickly help people shift. And a lot of these sellers wanted to get online and wanted to sell online, but just didn’t make the time to do so. So this was kind of a forcing function to show them all the benefits of being online. And I think what that ultimately does is they will have a lot more attention online as the offline comes back and be much stronger businesses because of it, which is awesome.
We’ve also seen some calls from very large sellers, which have increased since March. It’s been up over 30%. And they are coming to us because of the omnichannel ecosystem as well. We saw just one example. We had a chain of breweries which was struggling to adapt with the pandemic. And they came to us to install their online business with the competitor. Instead, we were able to get them up and running much, much faster. So they switched everything to us. So it’s really important to emphasize that as we come out of this, we do believe that a lot of sellers are going to get creative and they’re not just going to be in the retail category or in the restaurants category or in the services category, they’re going to merge these things, and Square is the only one out there that actually covers all the verticals with all the critical tools to actually be creative and serve your customers in new ways.
So we’re seeing larger sellers at scale. We’re seeing our current customers and we’re seeing new customers who see this omnichannel offering and want to go with us because we’re easier. And I do believe that the speed at which we’re able to move and the volume we are able to move with the PPP program for our sellers versus the rest of the financial institutions will be a net positive for us in terms of a goodwill halo, attracting a lot of sellers our way because there are very, very rich seller networks of sellers asking another seller what tools to use and why. What’s the company like. What have they done well for you in the past and what have they done poorly. So I think how we’ve handled our sellers and supported them throughout this time will be a huge win for us in terms of retaining, but also newer sellers as well. And just to add a final point to that. Some of the marketing results that we’re seeing that I mentioned earlier are showing that those new weekly seller cohorts that we’re attracting since the middle of March are larger both in aggregate across the cohort and on an individual seller-by-seller basis versus pre-COVID levels, which really shows to underscore the point Jack was making that we believe we’re a differentiated ecosystem that’s attracting not only larger sellers, but broader sizes of cohorts of sellers in this very dynamic time. All right, that’s helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Misuraca from Red White & Que. Your line is open. Hi. I’m a Square seller with Red White & Que Smokehouse here in Kearny, New Jersey. Regarding Inventory, Square Online Store shows sold out on the website once an item inventory hits zero. But for business like ours, we have a variable amount each day. As more quick service restaurants like us, Red White & Que shifts to Square Online Store during the COVID-19, we’re seeing more for a flexible inventory management system. Are there plans to build out features like this for quick service restaurants using Square Online Store? Yes. Hey Dan, this is Jack. Thanks for using Square, and hope you’re staying safe. This is something we’re actively working on. Inventory is a big focus area for us and we accelerated a bunch of our roadmap in order to support curbside pickup and delivery. And we need to make sure that we’re adding the option to organize orders by fulfillment channel out of the site on mobile without the app, modified delivery zones. So we’re getting a ton of feedback in this time on what’s working and what’s not working in regards to inventory and generally with the system as we’ve shifted to this new world, and we’re working as fast as we can on it. So, I appreciate the feedback and we’re on it. Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Good to hear you guys’ voices. My question is on related to Cash App and the transaction activity you’re seeing there. Last week Visa reported that their U.S. debit volumes were actually trending positive low-single-digits in late April due to some of the stimulus spending. Are you seeing similar trends like that on the Cash Card? And then looking forward, do you expect Cash Card volumes to remain pretty resilient because they’re tied to non-discretionary spending or how are you thinking about the employment impact there? Are a lot of the Cash App users some of the folks that unfortunately we’re seeing unemployed currently. What is your outlook in general for the transaction activity on Cash Card? Thank you. Hey, Lisa. I’ll start us off. Thanks for the question. April was a strong month, as you heard for Cash App overall. And including for Cash Card where we saw Cash Card’s highest monthly total for both orders and for volumes of spend across the Cash Card. Following the deceleration that we saw in late March, growth troughed around the end of March and spend began to rebound in early April even before the stimulus payments, which roughly came in about mid-April. Ahead of the government stimulus programs, customers explored direct deposit functionality and engaged with the app. We saw significant increase in Cash Card orders and a growth in active across the active base for Cash Card. And that was prior to the second IRS portal release on April 15.
As the stimulus payments were disbursed, we saw a material increase in volumes per card active as Cash App serves really a critical need here by helping customers access and use their funds rapidly. The uplift in weekly spend has continued in the second half of April, although still below pre-COVID levels. And we’re seeing the spending behavior on Cash Card shift toward more card-not-present and online commerce, as you can understand, given shelter-in-place measures. We’re also seeing elevated non-discretionary spend; grocers, health and wellness, retail away from bars, restaurants, entertainment, transportation that we would have seen pre-COVID. And we believe the unique aspect that we have here with the Boost program has positioned us to help individuals where we’re using our ecosystem here to help benefit our customers and actively rotating our Boost awards offered to specific merchants and categories including things like grocery, pharmacies and Dollar stores.
In terms of the broader question about unemployment, we are very watchful here and we want to see what normalized spending looks like post the stimulus efforts. So it’s probably too early for us to say, but we are very encouraged both in the growth of the base of users across Cash App and Cash Card and the depth of the engagement that we’ve seen through products like direct deposit in the last weeks and months. Super helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. Also related Cash App and a little bit of a follow-up there on direct deposit. So yes, the Cash App stats across the board were pretty impressive, especially I think the direct deposit was really a standout. The shareholder letter shows direct deposit active users up more than – it looks like more than 2X month-over-month into April and mentioned the stimulus checks being a big driver there of the direct deposit activity. But what can you tell us about these users in terms of perhaps their propensity to continue to use direct deposit with their paychecks beyond the stimulus?
And then as somewhat of a follow-up there. What are some of the things in general that Cash App either has already done or is planning to do to help continue that strong adoption of a primary account usage? I did notice that you mentioned the eligibility increased from about 3 million to 14 million in terms of direct deposit, so that sounds like a pretty good start. Yes. Thanks, Tim. I hope you’re well. We do believe direct deposit is a huge opportunity. And as we said in the opening, direct deposit customers are some of the most engaged on the platform. And they typically carry much higher balances and use more of our products like bitcoin and equities in addition to Cash Card and peer-to-peer. We saw two significant bumps recently. Customers that received their tax refunds and depositor paychecks used our ecosystem a whole lot more and we saw an increase in P2P volumes and Cash Card spend in late February and also in late March.
And then in April, obviously, the government stimulus provided us an opportunity to help folks receive their money much, much faster. And our teams did work, as we mentioned, with our partner banks to expand the 3 million direct deposit accounts we had in February to 14 million. We also made sure that the interface is very clear. So, when you click into the tab that is actually where the money is stored, you should see your direct deposit routing number right away.
So just putting it upfront so that people know that this is a tool that can be used for tax, for your stimulus, for your paycheck at your job is critical. And that does lead to people seeing Cash App ultimately as a primary account, not needing to go to a bank branch regarding to going to the App Store, signing up and they are in business. And it’s not just around peer-to-peer and storing money and using on the card, but the people, who are using that money to buy equities, using that to invest in product and also buy bitcoin has been pretty incredible.
So, this is part of the reason why we think the ecosystem strategy is so strong. We’re not just a peer-to-peer app. We’re not just a stock purchasing app. We’re not just a bitcoin app. We have everything in one. And everything that is interesting in terms of how I think about my own personal finances and spend my money is all in one simple straightforward app that we will continue to make better and add more adjacent features that complement some of these critical needs that people are telling us they have. And Tim, just to add a couple metrics to this topic; from March to April, we saw direct deposit volumes grow by 3X. From March to April, we saw new direct deposit transacting active grow by 4X. And from March to April, we saw our stored funds grow from $945 million across the base of Cash App users to over $1.3 billion.
So clearly, this is a product that’s resonated. And we believe we’re in a transformational moment right now, where new commerce standards, new banking habits, new ways of conducting financial services and commerce are taking shape. And Cash App, along with our Seller business has an opportunity to serve our customers uniquely in this moment. So, while I think it’s early for us to say what happens or what changes with the curve of direct deposit in the future, this is a key priority for us and encouraging signs that we’ve seen in the month of April here. Great. Thanks a lot, definitely noted on the metrics, the change to the interface and more features to come. So, thanks a lot. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you for taking the question, and really impressive work that you’ve done for your consumers and sellers. I wanted to ask a higher level question on Cash App. When you look at the newer customers that you’ve may be pulled in, in the last month or so, is it expanding the audience in addressable market in any ways? And obviously, I had some really good stats on the online store, any sense to give us how many sellers have actually lit up that product that would be really helpful? Thank you. Thanks, Josh. I do believe that it is expanding the audience pretty dramatically. Cash App has been something really special for us and that it has a lot of association with a pretty strong culture. It’s not seen as just a traditional financial app, it’s seen as part of the culture in many ways and we’re seeing that play out, especially now during COVID-19.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, like all the donating that’s happening on social media, the fundraising, the tipping to artists and musicians, this is all pretty new, and we’re looking at this closely and we’re taking the opportunities to form partnerships that there are some, like we announced a partnership with Spotify, which lets listeners contribute and send money to artists that post their cashtag on their artist page. And more than 25,000 artists have already linked their Cash App account with Spotify. And we saw more than 100,000 tips in the first week since the launch.
Another big area is gamers. We’re seeing a lot of activity in regards to Cash App on Twitch. In the first quarter, we launched our Twitch channel and we’ve grown our follower account to over 180,000. But what’s interesting about this is like there’s a lot of similarities between what we’re seeing around music and also gaming and how Cash App is being used in both.
So, we have reached a very mainstream influential audience. And because of the simplicity, because of how we handle the stimulus check and because of everything that you can do within the app inclusive of buying stocks and bitcoin and the Cash Card, we think we’ll benefit and draft off a lot of trust, a lot of love for what it offers and what it can do. And word of mouth is definitely our friend here. So, we consistently see the Cash App in the top 10 of the App Stores and consistently, see it rise as new people broadcast are in use of it. So, there is a very nice viral loop that is inherent in the system that continues to compound and grow favorably.
On the second question, how many sellers have used the Square Online Store; Amrita, do you want to take this? Sure. I’ll hit that one and maybe, just one final point before I do that on the cash opportunity. If you remember, Josh, we released some slides in late March related to addressable market across both our Cash App ecosystem and the Seller ecosystem. Cash App ecosystem addresses over 100 million people in the U.S. with a target age of between 15 and 39, which represents $60 billion of opportunity across just the product areas that we serve today. So, we envision a really significant runway ahead for Cash App. And Cash App in the month of April at various points was in the top five of the iOS App Store in terms of downloaded apps only behind some chat apps. So, clearly resonating, as Jack said, in this sort of cultural moment that we’re in.
Turning to your second question on Square Online Store, we can speak about Square Online Store, and then let’s level up and talk about broader our CNP offerings, our card-not-present offerings. So, Online Store, we haven’t provided a usage number in terms of active sellers, but on a weekly GPV basis up 5X since mid-March, pre-COVID effectively. And our most recent weekly GPV run rate was at $59 million or $3 billion on an annualized basis. And now the daily sign-ups that we’re seeing to Square Online Store are higher in number than what our typical sign-ups would have been for the point-of-sale app pre-COVID.
So clearly, resonating and resonating for new sellers as well as existing sellers. But again, I would think about our broader omnichannel strategy rather than just focusing on the online store. And more broadly, our card-not-present products, as I mentioned earlier, now over 50% of our volumes versus a third of our volumes prior to COVID. And that spend is not just for online store, but invoices, virtual terminal, parts of our developer platform with the e-commerce API, and this has been an area of strength for us with positive GPV growth year-over-year in the month of April. Very helpful, Jack and Amrita. Thanks so much. Thanks, Josh. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Hi. This is Cathy on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question. And I just wanted to get an update on Seller churn and whether you found specific programs or initiatives with sellers to be particularly effective? And perhaps, if you have any new products or initiatives coming maybe to complement some of the existing ones you already have? Thank you. I can maybe, start us off on this one. So, in terms of churn, it’s typically a variable figure for us given the large portion of micro-sellers that we serve, who may be seasonable – seasonal. So, given the noise that we see today and how early trends are shaping up, the main indicator I’d point you towards, would be change in gross profit or change in GPV growth, which as noted for the Seller business is in that minus 35% or minus 39% range for the month of April.
We’ve noted earlier on the call that the back half of April, we’ve seen improving trends based on existing sellers transitioning to new forms of commerce, based on new sellers coming in, based on stimulus efforts. We’ve also noted that certain areas with easing shelter in place measures we’ve seen further improvement and what we’ve seen in terms of number of unique cards and number of unique sellers in the back half of April has also improved, which to us, indicates that we have sellers, who are able to reopen their business in the back half of April. So, those are kind of the trends that we’ve seen around churn.
In terms of the key things that we can do for our sellers, I think a lot of them have been noted on this call. Sellers are looking for omnichannel solutions that enable them to interact with their buyers in new formats, whether that’s with commerce, online, invoices, et cetera. They’re also looking for cash flow and opportunities to bridge them in this really disruptive time. And the PPP program, where we helped enable over $0.5 billion in loans in the past week, has also gone a long way to supporting our sellers and speaks to the strength of the ecosystem that we were able to move quickly and get this product up and running in just a few short weeks.
Within each of these products, you see features that are working towards supporting our sellers, whether it’s pre-populating applications in the PPP program for payroll sellers or it’s the order and pickup delivery product that was launched in the span of a few short weeks as well as on the cash business, where the Sprint towards enabling government stimulus and direct deposit accounts, our teams are working very, very hard. No boondoggles happening at the company right now. Our teams are working very, very hard to enable new products, and features across supporting our sellers and individuals. Kathy, this is also one of the areas, where the ecosystem strategy makes us a lot stronger. A seller may churn out of one product, but still be using two others or three others from us. So, they’re not churning out with the whole company, and as we add more of those critical functions and tools that gets even more and more durable. So, a lot of the reason why behind the ecosystem strategy is exactly this. But like everyone else, we’re learning as quickly as possible in partnership with our sellers on what’s working during this time, what they need, how they think about rebounding as more things reopen and all those learnings will be distilled into products and features going forward.
And we’re doing that with our current customers, our small customers and even our larger customers, who are rediscovering new ways and discovering our other tools like Ben & Jerry’s is a good example of this. These are point-of-sale across 200 retail shops and needed to pivot to online. So, we showed – we demoed the Square Online Store and they’re rolling it out nationwide over the coming weeks. So, if you’re very small or very large, what we think, helps the most with retaining is making sure that people see our full suite of services and gain value out of them. Great. Thanks for the answer. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Friedman [ph] from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good to hear your voices. That Ben & Jerry’s making me hungry. I just want to ask, a part of the investment operating narrative has been about the cross-selling of Seller and Cash App. And I was just wondering in light of the current business environment, how that may have affected your thinking on the cross-selling of Cash and Seller ecosystems? You had a lot of good use cases, Jack, in your prepared remarks. So, is that something that you’re moving forward in terms of your kind of time horizon? Thank you. Yes. Great question, Jamie. So, we are moving forward. We did have to reprioritize our roadmap just to handle some of the issues that we’re presently seeing and challenges we’re seeing with our sellers and Cash App customers due to COVID. But we do believe that there is a lot of real strength that comes from connecting the two ecosystems. They’re amazing independently, but as we look for those connection points whether they’d be a boost to local sellers, what we’ve done with our payroll product and paying employees with Cash App so they could access their funds immediately.
So, there’s a number of those that we think are really interesting and potentially really impactful. So, we wanted to make sure that we’re handling the present challenge first, but we’re definitely not taking our eyes off the ball in terms of how we connect these two down the line. Thank you. Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Ramsey El Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Hey, guys. This is Ben on for Ramsey, and thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, kind of wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier questions about the change in the product roadmap. I noticed international revenue had grown pretty nicely in the quarter. And I guess, first, is that just due to a kind of a broader suite of products now being rolled out in all the countries? But more specifically, the question I’m kind of wondering is that what are the opportunities you see being pushed out? And kind of how does your roadmap specifically there change with everything going on right now? Maybe, I can kick us off with what we’ve seen from an international perspective in the first quarter and in April. From an April perspective, international GCV was down 20%, which was a deceleration versus prior COVID levels. From a first quarter perspective, GAAP international revenue was up 51%. So, strong growth for us and consistent with what we had seen in the prior couple of quarters, where we had seen outperformance as our products are resonating internationally.
In terms of breaking down some of those trends related to COVID that we’ve seen in April, as I mentioned earlier, in April, in Australia, we’re now seeing positive year-over-year growth. From a UK perspective, we’re seeing modest declines, and Japan and Canada are still down year-over-year, but seeing improvement as well. So, very consistent with the broader narrative that we’ve been sharing on this call so far from a COVID impact perspective. And obviously, our products continue to resonate there from an omnichannel perspective internationally as they do in the U.S. Yes. And just to follow-up, we’re not going to take our focus off growing outside of the United States; we’re making sure that our ecosystem is sound and comprehensive outside the United States. We have done a lot of good work over the past few quarters, but there’s a lot more to do. And we – the same needs that we see during this time in the U.S. with COVID we’re seeing globally as well and we want to make sure that the thing that sets us apart is this ecosystem and it helps us set us apart, not just in the United States, but everywhere. And we’ve learned a ton from the U.S. on how various products took off, and that helps our sequencing around these roadmaps. So, we can be more sure of the impact as we put the work into actually do the work to launch. Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Thank you, Ben. Thank you. I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you everyone for joining our call. I would like to remind everyone that we’ve been hosting our second quarter 2020 earnings call on August 5. Thanks again, for participating today. This concludes today’s conference call.

We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We'll begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause the results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results is for the month of July. These represent our current estimate for July performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of July, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual July results may differ from these estimates. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, we changed our operating segments to reflect how we review and assess our operations and began reporting on Seller and Cash App as separate segments. As such, we introduced additional disclosures in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website as well as our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, for revenue and gross profit for our Seller and Cash App operating reporting segments.
As a reminder, we discontinued the use of adjusted revenue in the third quarter of 2019 following the receipt of and comment letter from and discussions with the SEC. Our statement of operations continues to disclose total net revenue, transaction-based costs and bitcoin costs determined in accordance with GAAP, which are the key components of adjusted revenue. There are no changes to any other GAAP or non-GAAP metrics. We have posted a spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website with our historical financials and additional details related to our income statement. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us so early today. Due to the media's early release of our quarterly financials, we moved up our investor call to this morning. We're conducting an investigation into this early release in consultation with both internal and external counsel. COVID-19 continues to be at the top of our minds as economies close, reopen and close yet again. This has been extremely hard on the people we serve, our sellers, their employees and all the individuals who use Cash App. Folks right now are struggling to keep their businesses open, pay their employees, pay rent and even buy food for their families. We're doing our best to learn and build to support our customers, but this is obviously much bigger than us at Square. Parts of the world lack a coordinated strategy to get out of this crisis, and that hurts more people every single day. It's up to all of us to take whatever action we can to end this from wearing a mask to protect ourselves and our families, to using whatever platform we have to demand that our elected officials coordinate better. Just can't wait for an election day.
On top of that, the fear, pain and suffering our Black customers, employees and neighbors have felt every day for the past hundreds of years due to racist systems and policies must be acknowledged and fixed. We're seeing a bit more acknowledgment, but not nearly enough change. This also can't wait for an election day. We're taking action as an employer. We're investing in Black and racial and ethnic minority communities, and we're looking for ways to drive racial justice through our business and products. I will also be personally putting more funds into organizations driving policy change through the Start Small initiative I announced months ago. We are always open to feedback and ideas on ways we can do our part on these issues. Please let us know if you have any. And now some updates on our business before I turn to Amrita and your questions, starting with the Cash App. In June, Cash App had more than 30 million active customers transacting on our service. And in July, we expect to achieve gross profit growth of more than 200% year-over-year. We saw our customers increasingly use their Cash Card as their primary spending device. 7 million people paid with their Cash Card in June, double compared to last year. We also saw an increase in people using direct deposit for recurring paychecks, strengthened by stimulus and unemployment checks and tax refunds.
Cash App is culture and continued to show this with creative approaches to marketing. We announced we ride with Bubba Wallace, and you'll see his Cash App designed car and uniform throughout the NASCAR season. And we partnered with Hood by Air, a phenomenal streetwear brand, to create a limited edition HBA Cash Card you can purchase with proceeds going to Black and LGBTQ communities. As I mentioned earlier, our sellers have had to navigate an immense amount of uncertainty and challenges. They've used our ecosystem to reach their customers in new ways. And in the second quarter, GPV from online channels was up more than 50% year-over-year. One in three new online sellers onboarded in the second quarter were entirely new to Square, and many of these sellers adopted other parts of our ecosystem, including in-person commerce.
For example, the Coffee Tree Roasters in Pittsburgh joined Square by launching an online store, previously never having a website. This quarter, they converted their five locations to Square hardware for their in-person point-of-sale system. We're also seeing an increase in contactless payment as customers don't want to use paper cash during – due to COVID risk. In March, one in 12 of our sellers were cashless. And by the end of June, that shifted to one in four of our sellers operating cashless. We launched On-Demand Delivery functionality, which enables sellers to take control of their fulfillment process by offering delivery to their customers directly from their websites. And our sellers gained the benefit of Square's scale by retaining more of the economics compared to using a third-party delivery service.
During the quarter, we facilitated Paycheck Protection Program loans, providing a financial lifeline to more than 80,000 small businesses around the country for a total of $873 million in PPP loans. Through the program, we reached traditionally underserved sellers. The average PPP loan through Square Capital was less than $11,000 or one-tenth the average small business administration loan. And finally, we're saying goodbye to Aaron Zamost, our Head of Communications and People, who's been helping us not only with this call since our IPO, but has been helping us build Square for close to nine years. Aaron made us better every day. We love Aaron, and we thank you. Amrita? Thanks, Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover today; first, a look at our performance in the second quarter, where trends for both Cash App and Seller improved each month during the quarter; second, an update on our business in July, where Seller showed signs of stability and cash growth further improved; third, the compelling opportunity we see to invest in each of our ecosystems. Overall, in the second quarter, gross profit was $597 million, up 28% year-over-year or 32% growth, excluding Caviar. Net loss was $11 million and adjusted EBITDA was $98 million.
Let's take a look at performance of each ecosystem in the quarter. For Cash App, we saw strong growth with gross profit of $281 million, increasing 167% year-over-year as our teams continue to focus on network growth and driving engagement. As Jack mentioned, we saw an uplift in customer acquisition with more than 30 million monthly transacting active customers in June. In the second quarter, these customers were transacting more than 15 times per month on average or every other day, which is up nearly 50% from a year ago. We saw customers join Cash App for our ecosystem of products and features.
In the second quarter, new cohorts of Cash App customers had higher attach rates to products beyond peer-to-peer payments, such as Cash Card, Boost, direct deposit and bitcoin investing. This adoption has driven higher lifetime value. Customers who use two or more products generated two to three times the revenue of customers who only use peer-to-peer. For our Seller ecosystem, gross profit was $317 million, down 9% year-over-year. Seller GPV trends improved sequentially each month from April through June. Three factors to call out here. First, we've invested in building out our omnichannel capabilities over the past two years and have seen sellers utilize our broader ecosystem, particularly in these dynamic times. Our online strategy includes a variety of channels that serve sellers of all types and sizes, connecting them with buyers through web and mobile. In the second quarter, GPV from online channels was up more than 50% year-over-year and made up more than 25% of our Seller GPV, up from 14% of Seller GPV a year ago.
Second, while card-present volumes were down 38% year-over-year in the quarter, we saw significant improvement in card-present volumes sequentially each month as certain states relaxed shelter-in-place restrictions.
Third, our contactless hardware has empowered our sellers to adapt to social distancing measures and has been an important differentiator for our ecosystem. Beginning in mid-May, we offered promotional pricing on our hardware and saw a significant uplift in unit sales per Square Register and Square Terminal through the end of the quarter. These products continue to serve as an important acquisition tool, bringing in new sellers to Square. Adjusted EBITDA of $98 million was primarily driven by a stronger recovery than anticipated in our Seller business and outperformance in our Cash App business. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter also benefited from the release of transaction loss provisions or reserves for risk loss, primarily related to transactions in our Seller business during the first quarter, which trended more favorably than our provisions had assumed.
As a reminder, our overall company profitability margin profile is driven in part by the mix of our business. The Seller business has high-margin revenue streams, and changes in growth can have an outsized impact on profitability, whereas Cash App is still early in its profitability ramp as we began monetizing Cash App only four years ago. We recognize there can be a wide range of outcomes for our financial results during the remainder of the year, depending on regional restrictions of business reopenings and government stimulus efforts. Therefore, we are not providing third quarter or full year financial guidance at this time. Instead, similar to last quarter, we wanted to share with you what we are seeing in real time.
In July, we saw impressive growth in Cash App and signs of stability in our Seller ecosystem. Cash App, we saw gross profit growth, as Jack said, of more than 200% year-over-year in July, showing continued momentum from the second quarter. The strength in our Cash App business in July was broad-based, including growth in our network with our highest monthly increase in net new transacting actives and an increase in new product adoption.
We also saw an uplift in monetization with our highest monthly volume per active customer across peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card and bitcoin investing. While we're encouraged by these results, we recognize government stimulus programs contributed to the uplift in growth and spend per customer. If stimulus programs are either reduced or not renewed, or if we see an impact to customer -- consumer spending, we would not expect Cash App's growth to sustain at these levels. There is a lot that is unknown here, and growth could normalize. As a reminder, pre-COVID, we saw Cash App gross profit growth of more than 100% year-over-year in the first quarter.
In July, we expect our Seller ecosystem to achieve gross profit growth of more than 5% on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the main drivers, Seller GPV was up 5% year-over-year in July, which was a modest improvement compared to results in June. In the U.S., we saw a step-up around the 4th of July. But excluding this holiday, GPV was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis and trends were relatively stable from June to July. In our international markets, we saw strong GPV growth of 40% year-over-year, which improved moderately compared to June. Regional trends have continued to vary depending on the extent for shelter-in-place restrictions, and we expect variability, given the ongoing uncertainty. Seller subscription and services gross profit was down year-over-year in July, primarily driven by Square Capital's pause of core flex loans. While Square Capital revenue was immaterial in July, in the past few days, we reopened core flex loans under stricter eligibility criteria. Given we have insight into real-time data, we are closely watching trend, and we believe we are taking a conservative approach to relaunching this product.
Seller subscription and services-based revenue from our other products achieved positive growth year-over-year in July. We allowed sellers to pause their subscriptions starting in May. And at the end of July, less than 10% of our sellers with subscriptions had elected to pause. Finally, we believe now is a compelling opportunity to invest in both of our ecosystems. Compared to the second quarter, we're investing an incremental $100 million in the third quarter across non-GAAP operating expenses for product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The significant majority of this investment will be on sales and marketing.
As we have continued to be encouraged by recent acquisition trends and see a compelling opportunity to acquire new customers, we intend to closely track performance to be dynamic with our spend, including increasing spend if we see strong results. Across both ecosystems, we have historically seen strong returns on our acquisition spend of at least three times within 3 years of acquiring a cohort. For Cash App, we'll look at new and creative marketing strategies to reach more customers and further engaging existing customers as we continue to rapidly scale the network. For Seller, incremental investment will primarily focus on brand and ecosystem awareness marketing campaigns and adding to our sales and account management teams. In the second quarter, we saw strong trends in our acquisition as new Seller cohorts generated higher gross profit in their first five weeks post onboarding compared to new Seller cohorts in the prior year period.
We're making a deliberate decision to invest given the recent momentum we've seen. This is a unique moment to reach new customers with our differentiated products, and we believe this approach will drive long-term, sustainable growth for Square.
I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Thanks. Hope you can hear me. Thanks for the remarks and July update. I wanted to ask on the sustainability of Cash App. I heard the 200% growth in July and the 100% obviously was running at before. So I know the sustainability question is really hard to answer, given stimulus and the uncertainty there, but anything else to help maybe unpack the thinking if stimulus isn't extended? What might happen? Then the 30 million users, how sticky do you think that number is? You acquired them. How do you expect to retain them and monetize that given the various scenarios that are out there? Thank you. Tien-Tsin, thank you so much for the question. Let me start off here by saying, as you noted, we drove impressive growth in the second quarter, gross profit up 167% year-over-year on Cash App. Each month since March, we saw improvement in gross profit growth and expect over 200% year-over-year gross profit growth in July.
There's three key drivers I'd call out on Cash App's growth. Stimulus likely benefited all three of these drivers. Let's unpack that a little bit. First, as you noted, customer acquisition, which remains a top priority for Cash App, and we continued to rapidly expand our network here. In June, we had over 30 million monthly active, which is up approximately 25% just in the past six months, and this was followed in July by our highest month of net new actives added. And we're continuing to keep those customers engaged by my second point, which is product adoption. We've increased adoption across our seven Cash App products in the second quarter, cross-selling at low incremental costs. And we're driving -- we're focused here on driving daily utility for our customers. In the second quarter, as we noted, Cash App monthly active had an average of over 15 transactions per month essentially every other day here, which was up 50%, nearly 50% from a year ago.
Third, the driver was increased volumes per active customers across key products in the second quarter, and you saw the strong monetization flow through. Revenue on a per customer basis neared $45 on an annualized basis in the second quarter of 2020, excluding bitcoin, which is up three times since 2017. So as you noted, stimulus is a factor that likely benefited all three of the drivers. Cash App was well positioned to help our customers' access -- to make use of these government stimulus funds and unemployment benefits in the second quarter. Obviously, these are wide-ranging programs with extensive reach. 165 million individuals qualified for CARES Act stimulus payments and nearly 18 million were unemployed as of June.
From the stimulus, we've seen increased inflows into our ecosystem: a portion from direct deposit, which is still early, but a more meaningful uplift from customers simply having additional funds in their wallet. As customers are pulling more funds into Cash App, that drives further engagement and network effects, and they're able to send money to others through peer-to-peer, spend their funds through Cash Card; invest in stocks and more, which we saw with new customer cohorts doing that at a higher rate in the second quarter. This resembles -- what we saw here resemble the uplift from inflows, we've seen in the February, March time frame historically around tax refund. There is a lot, as you noted, that's unknown around stimulus going forward and the impact to our business.
Cash App growth could normalize in the back half of the year. The variability we may see here is one of the reasons we're not providing guidance, on the second half of the year. And instead, we're focusing on understanding and tracking our trends in real time. Got you. It sounds really interesting and pretty impressive. So thanks for your update. Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC. Thanks and good morning. And I agree very impressive results here. I had a question about, really the Cash App and Cash Card attachment rates. Given that this is clearly one of the major drivers of the monetization strategy, at least today. So it looks like it's running still in the low 20s. I'm wondering how we should be thinking about, that expectation and opportunity longer term? And maybe specifically, what are some of the key factors and attributes that you're doing in order to drive that rate higher? Thanks. Maybe I'll start off on the attachment rates. And then Jack can cover on the product strategy. From an attachment perspective, as you've seen where our customers are increasingly using Cash Card, as an everyday spending tool. At the end of June, we had over 7 million monthly active Cash Card customers, which doubled year-over-year from 3.5 million, which we had shared with you last June. And we're continuing to increase that attach rate over time. Today, we sit at about one in four customers, Cash App customers, who have a Cash Card, with Cash Card actives growing faster than our overall network. The majority of these 7 million monthly active Cash Card customers are spending on their Cash Card an average of five times per week.
So again, that focuses on daily utility here. And our customers are increasingly using Cash Card as a primary spending tool, as the average spend per customer has also increased over time. As you also saw, we've been able -- Cash Card has been resilient, in the second quarter. We've been able to drive strong growth here, with spend up nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter, compared to -- for the industry, U.S. cards have been down about 8%, across several card issuers quarter-over-quarter. We believe, it's still early and want to continue driving adoption here with both new and existing customers. Hi. Dan, this is Jack. So first and foremost, like the basis of everything we do around Cash App starts with the utility of peer-to-peer. And then, we're looking for the most critical financial services that people haven't had access to in the past, as a way to build out our ecosystem.
So a big part of our strategy is making sure that we have very credible, easy inflows into the service, such as direct deposit, which people are hooking their payroll to, they're hooking their tax refunds, stimulus check, unemployment checks to. And then using the peer-to-peer, where they send money to friends or family or request money, which gets us an entirely new customer as well.
So there's an incredibly efficient network effect, built in the Cash App. And then what make it stick, to also answer some of the previous question is, all the other services within the app itself. So the fact that I have a Cash Card and I can now purchase cards as well, one by Hood by Air for $20.
And yesterday, we launched a glow card, which glows in the dark for $5, which allows people to customize. I can buy equities, through our investing products. I can buy bitcoin. And I can utilize all this in my day-to-day.
So we continue to look, as we look forward to the roadmap, for those critical financial elements, that people haven't had easy access to in the past. And we believe we can bring to them with the Cash App. But it all begins with the peer-to-peer aspect and the viral nature of the service itself. Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Fulgham with Evans Meats. Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. You were able to start using the online Square store in a matter of hours at the start of the pandemic. And after that, we were able to seamlessly start using Square hardware for on-premise sales. We found it to be easy, straightforward and just a super transition. Now I'm wondering if you plan to take that same approach and emphasize ease of use with any of your planned new features and updates, areas like reporting. Hey, Josh, first of all, thank you for being our customer. I appreciate you and appreciate all the challenges that you and others are going through this time. There's a lot of uncertainty. We want to make sure that every aspect of our service from the payment itself to inventory to reporting is remarkable, and remarkable for us is something that ultimately gives time back to you and making sure that as we think about any new feature, we look for making it intuitive, we make it fast and easy. Because ultimately, like if we're doing that, we're giving time back to you, the owner or your employees and you can use that time to focus on your customer, which will grow your business and also grow ours. So we think we have really good alignment there. And if there's anything in particular that you feel is weak or a gap, please let our account managers know, our sales team, customer support, and we'll get on it. But thank you so much. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking the question. My question -- so around the Cash App, but also on an SMB angle. So Cash App is clearly the leading consumer digital bank or neobank in the U.S., but there seems to be an opportunity that isn't really discussed as much around neobanks or digital banks for small businesses. It seems like it could potentially have better LTV and monetization dynamics relative to consumer neobanks. And when I think about all the components that could be there for an SMB digital bank, Square already has accounts, Square Card for business, credit offerings through Square Capital. But if it was sort of tied all together with a digital wallet, it would start to look like an SMB neobank. You could potentially layer in payroll and other things like AP automation, and I wanted to just explore this a little bit to see if it's something that could be a longer-term potential opportunity for Square. Thanks, Tim. Are you looking for a role as a product manager as well? Yes, please. It's a great idea. It's a great idea. And I completely agree that we have a huge opportunity here. We've taken -- if you look at our Seller ecosystem, you'll see a number of parts that are connected together. And I think we have a lot of the parameters in place to do exactly what you said. Square Card is a great opportunity for us and gives our sellers the ability to actually store money with us and spend that money without having to go to a bank branch to open their business, which is phenomenal for them. Square Capital allows us to offer loans and instant deposit. All these tools connected in the right way will mirror, I believe, what we have been able to do with the Cash App, but also for sellers. And that is, ultimately, our intention is to save more and more of our customers' trips to a traditional bank branch so they can just get running in business and building that up. And Tim, to your point on, yes, Cash App sort of economics relative to neobanks and other sort of digital banks out there. What we've seen with Cash App so far is strong unit economics, a strong business model. What -- some of the things that we feel differentiate the business model we've got around Cash App is strong network effects, which leads to efficient acquisition. These network effects obviously come from the peer-to-peer aspect of the service, where Cash App can acquire new customers for a fraction of the cost of other banks or a financial services company, and that's really enabled us to scale this network of active customers rapidly and efficiently now at 30 million monthly active and growing.
And then also from a unit economic standpoint, Cash App has historically had a payback of less than 12 months on these new monthly cohorts, similar to Seller. And in less than three years, returns from these cohorts have been over 3 times on our acquisition spend. And it's because of that suite of products that we have around financial services and centered around peer-to-peer that we can efficiently cross-sell, as noted, driving ARPU up on a per customer basis 3 times since 2017 to nearly $45 on an annualized basis in 2Q. And so those monthly actives become more valuable actually over time as they adopt more products within the Cash App ecosystem. So we're excited of the potential here as Cash App continues to grow and expand, and we see the opportunity to drive higher lifetime value, higher engagement by growing the base by cross-selling our existing products and eventually launching new products over time as well. Great. Thanks a lot. Your next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. All right. Thanks, guys. Nice job. Spend from the online channels being up over 50%, making up 25% of the GPV, obviously, helped quite a bit, especially, during the pandemic. But if we break that down a bit, just wondering what you see as a differentiation around the Online Store and I think perhaps just other online offerings enabling uses for on-demand delivery or like buy online, pick up in store. Can you just give us a little more color where you plan to invest further online? And just really where this can go long term? What's the product set differentiation around CNP? And where you see it headed, guys? Thanks a lot. Yes. Thank you, Darrin. If you look at any one part of online commerce and you compare it or a version of it to others, I don't think you see a lot of differences. But if you take them in concert with each other, that's where our strength is. So we -- our strategy of building an ecosystem of tools that work out of the box immediately and continue to unfold as a seller gets more and more sophisticated with their business and with their approach to customers is what sets us apart from everything else. So there's various aspects that have been important, especially during this time with COVID for sellers.
Square Online Checkout has been notable, so the businesses can transition online without building a complete website. Our Online Store has served very well as an acquisition tool for us. As I said in my opening remarks, 1 in 3 of our new Online Store sellers onboarded in the second quarter were new entirely to the Square ecosystem, and that's increased in July.
And then tools like On-Demand Delivery, giving our sellers access to third-party delivery apps, but also making sure that they can keep more of their sales has been important. We had a good example here, a little kebab shop and chain in Texas and California, started using On-Demand Delivery. And they -- what drew them was being able to provide customers with flexibilities on fees and delivery minimums, which helped them remain competitive at a cost they could afford.
So it's not any one part that really sets our strategy apart. It's the cohesiveness. It's the flexibility that sellers have to shift even the economics around so that they can really serve their customers and build the business that they want, especially in a time of uncertainty. And Darrin, I would just add that these trends that we're noting on online channels, up 50% year-over-year to 25% of Seller GPV, this is really a continuation of hard work that the team has been doing for some time now. These trends are actually fairly consistent with pre-COVID. For the past six quarters, our online channel GPV has sustained similar levels of growth of over 50%. But obviously, during this time, we're seeing unique use cases and that increasing importance of adapting quickly and serving -- our sellers serving their buyers where they are.
And then the last one I'd share is that, just to Jack's point about Square Online Store being increasingly an acquisition tool. We've also seen these online channels be a front door to Square, where new sellers who joined our platform through Square Online Store in the second quarter were using more of our ecosystem. And as much as half of their GPV actually came from in-person transactions as well, showing that obviously, these sellers are working hard to sell through multiple channels, both online and in person, which underscores the points around omnichannel. Right. That makes sense guys. Thank you. Your next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Following up on Darrin's question, I wanted to drill in a bit on the recovery in Seller GPV, which was pretty amazing from, I think it was running down 40% or so in April when businesses were closed and then now up growing 5% in July. That recovery far exceeds the economic recovery, which I believe, means you must have a lot of new sellers joining Square during this trying time. Can you drill into that a little bit and just dimension, quantify the uptick you're seeing in new sellers, how sustainable you think that growth rate is and maybe provide a little bit more color on what's different or new about these types of sellers and maybe other sources of new GPV you're seeing come in, if it's not just from new sellers joining the ecosystem. Thank you. Hey, Lisa, thanks for the question. So in the second quarter, GPV was down 15% year-over-year. Those year-over-year trends improved each month from April to July, whereas we noted, Seller GPV was up 5% year-over-year. There's kind of a couple of key drivers I'd point out and I'll come to customer acquisition by the end of it, so first key driver, obviously, COVID restrictions starting to ease in the second quarter. And as that happened, we saw related improvement in GPV. We obviously had variability in regions related to re-openings and retrenchments. Specifically in July, that modest improvement we saw from June was largely due, for us, to international growth as US volumes trended at similar rates since June, especially when you exclude the bump that we saw around the 4th of July holiday. So in the U.S., states that have had prolonged restrictions have been more affected in terms of GPV, in particular, states like California and New York are still well below those pre-COVID levels. On an international basis, Seller GPV grew by 40% year-over-year in July, which is an improvement from June, with particular strength in a couple of markets, Australia and the sharp recovery that we saw in the UK.
Second point I'd make here is around retention. As Seller GPV trends improved, we also saw improving trends around retention of our existing sellers. So the overall Seller GPV dollar-based retention in July was down approximately 10% to 15% year-over-year. This is a significant improvement, while still down year-over-year, a significant improvement from being down 50% in late April. So this GPV retention looks at the cohorts of our existing sellers from July of last year and the year-over-year change in the GPV generated by those sellers in July of this year, including churn, but excluding acquisition, which I'll come to in a moment. Across verticals, we saw better retention in services, in food and drink and in retail, while beauty and health and fitness were more impacted. And then when you look at GPV retention by seller size, in the second quarter, micro sellers were generally less impacted than larger sellers. So finally, new customer acquisition, as you heard, this is an area where we saw growth in terms of new cohort size in aggregate and on a per seller basis in the second quarter. And we want to lean in here, as you heard, behind the strong ROIs of over 3x over 3 years. We're encouraged by some of these trend lines, obviously, but recognize that we could continue to see variability in the trends depending on easing or retrenchment of restrictions and depending on stimulus, whether the PPP or consumer-driven stimulus. So we'll remain watchful of our up-to-date trend. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Pretty fantastic recovery, so thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the update on monthly active users on Cash App. So you added 6 million users between December and now. Can you give some more color on the evolving demographics of these Cash App users? Are they skewed towards unbanked and underbanked or digital native? And also, I know you gave an update for the user TAM per Square Cash App at your Investor Day update in March, but the world has changed in the last three months. So in light of the traction you've seen, what in your view could evolve to be Cash App's total addressable user base? Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, we do believe Cash App has reached a mainstream scale, and that's with over 30 million monthly active customers in June. And these are monthly active customers, not overall accounts. In terms of demographics, we continue to see strong growth from folks under 35, and we're also seeing a rising share of new customers over the age of 35 as well. In terms of geography, Cash App continues to have a strong presence in the South, but has also seen growing traction in the Midwest and both on the East and West Coast. As we look forward, we want to continue to reach more folks through innovative and inventive marketing, which we continue to excel around.
And one of our top priorities, as a Cash App team, is to expand outside the United States and the UK and to be a global service. So that's really important to us and something that we're going to learn a lot about this year and will help inform our next moves. But happy to say that Cash App continues to see mainstream adoption, and we're definitely broadening the base of people that we can actually reach. And Harshita to draw back to some of the TAM numbers, you were referencing back in March. What we had said back then was we believe Cash App's ecosystem addresses over 100 million people in the US with a target age between 15 and 39. And that, that represented a $60 billion opportunity in the products we serve today. Since then, obviously, you're hearing from us that we've had traction in age groups above 35. And obviously, we made a small acquisition internationally as well, Verse in Europe, still very early days there. But we see opportunities to grow this addressable market through expanding our service to serve everyone and outside of the US as well as in the US and eventually over time, expanding the addressable market through product launches over time as well. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question is from Josh Beck with KBCM. Thank you for taking the question and all the update. So I wanted to ask about Boost. It just seems like with the scale that you're establishing with Cash App that you could be getting more perhaps of the attention of the advertisers that might want to look at that platform. So would love an update there. And then with direct deposit, it seems like it had a really nice uptick tied to the stimulus payments. Any sense of maybe the follow-through and seeing it in a more traditional employment direct deposit use case as well? Yeah. Thank you, Josh, for the question. So in terms of Boost, we do believe there's a real platform there, and we're really excited about its potential. And we're learning as quickly as we can as to how to construct the right Boost for the right customers. But we do think there's a ton of opportunity there. So you're right.
And we're taking all of our learnings and building it into the service itself. But, this is definitely a bright star and something that as we add more capabilities like locations, it gets even more and more attractive to businesses looking to shine more attention on their services and products. In terms of direct deposit, as I said in an earlier answer, direct deposit is a priority for the Cash App team. We see that direct deposit customers are some of the most engaged on the Cash App and typically carrying much higher balances and using more products across the ecosystem.
The Cash Card customers who use direct deposits spend two to three times more than any other card actives. We've done a lot of work recently to improve the awareness, customer awareness of direct deposits. So we brought it up in the interface, maybe a lot easier to plug into your payroll system or your tax refund system or for your stimulus check or unemployment check. And this continues to be an incredible inflow for us and I think represents just the validation that Cash App is becoming more and more part of the fabric of individuals' lives and that they're paid – they're using their card to spend everywhere, including online and, of course, going back to peer-to-peer, bitcoin and in investing. So it really is a great entry point for the ecosystem and something we continue to want to strengthen and build up. Josh, I would just add on direct deposit. At the end of the first quarter, we mentioned that we had over 14 million customers with direct deposit accounts, which has obviously grown since then, meaning that they had account routing numbers.
Obviously, the number of actives receiving direct deposits each month is well below this. But what we've seen in second quarter, was continued strength in direct deposit adoption and steady growth in those paycheck deposits, to your question, in April to May to June. And we're really focused on increasing that penetration of paycheck deposits as we look to the back half of the year. We know these customers pull more funds into Cash App, store higher balances, adopt more products, they spend more, all of which, obviously, drives monetization and lifetime value. We see that strong correlation with funds pulled into Cash App and with revenue. And we saw also in the second quarter that stored funds in Cash App were over $1.7 billion, up 86% quarter-over-quarter here. So, obviously, continuing to make steady progress and focused on the back half of the year doing that as well. Very helpful. Thank you, both. Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Hey. Thanks guys. Good morning. I know that one of your peers mentioned that they estimated about 40% of the year-over-year increase in their card volumes in the quarter was attributable to stimulus. Does that number resonate at all with you guys? I know it's difficult to precisely measure the uplift, but just wanted to run that by you. And then I was also just curious on the Cash App gross profit growth in July. Obviously, fantastic, north of 200%. But how did that compare with the month of June? Thank you. On the last part of your question first, Jason, we saw growth through each month, month-over-month, and we saw improvements each month in that year-over-year growth rate for cash. So July was an improvement from what we saw in June in terms of that year-over-year growth rate for Cash App. But again, as you noted, stimulus is a key part of why we believe we saw increased inflows in our ecosystem, from April through July, a portion from direct deposit, which we just talked about and a more meaningful uplift just in terms of customers simply having additional funds in their wallet. We recognize that stimulus probably had impact on both ecosystems here in terms of customers having additional funds in their wallet as buyers. We don't have a specific number to share in terms of how much of that uplift was driven. We do believe that there's, as I mentioned on the Seller ecosystem, we saw that GPV dollar-based retention down 10% to 15% in July, compared to down 50% in April, and we saw that strong improvement through the second quarter. And with Cash App as well, we've seen improvements throughout the quarter, which we're going to try to capitalize on longer term. But obviously, watchful here, as there's a lot that's unknown as stimulus is potentially reduced or ended. Okay. Thanks Amrita. Thank you. Your next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Hi, guys. Good morning and congrats on the results. I just want to ask about the investments, how you guys are thinking about it? And the return on those investments, it sounds like it's going to be an incremental $100 million. And just trying to think about the EBITDA, how that's going to look, the cadence in the third and the fourth quarter? Thanks so much. Sure. Thanks for the question, Bryan. It's a unique time for us, as we said, to invest here. We believe both the Seller and Cash App businesses are well positioned to help our customers, both during COVID and beyond. And so we see an opportunity to invest in the back half. As we noted in Q3, we'll see a step-up we expect of at least $100 million compared to Q2. In Q4, we expect non-GAAP OpEx, excluding risk loss, to be relatively flat to slightly down versus the step-up in Q3. The significant majority of this $100 million step-up in Q3 will be sales and marketing investments across both ecosystems.
For Cash App, we've got a focus on our paid marketing channels. And given the strong growth that we've seen here, we intend on reinvesting the majority of the outperformance that we've seen in the back half of the year with that focus on paid marketing channels. Again, the viral acquisition on peer-to-peer network effects has helped us sustain a relatively low and stable acquisition cost at a fraction of what many others in the financial services space have to pay. And so we see an opportunity now to further enhance those network effects with paid marketing. And that strong engagement and monetization that you see with our Cash App customers can help grow customer lifetime value over time, which leads to strong ROI on that acquisition spend.
From a Seller perspective, we believe our omnichannel ecosystem, as you've heard so much today, is well positioned to acquire new sellers. And as you heard in the second quarter, despite the turbulent landscape that we've got, we achieved positive growth in gross profit from these sellers. And these Seller go-to-market investments contemplated in the back half of the year really just bring us back to what we'd originally planned to do for 2020, entering the year with a focus on awareness marketing campaigns as well as building out our sales and account management teams. With respect to EBITDA, obviously, with these investments, you could see some quarter-to-quarter variation in profitability. But we remain as ever focused on the long-term here, and we see a unique opportunity to invest. Okay. Great. Sounds good. Thanks so much for taking the question. Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on the direct deposit side and the opportunity there. I can appreciate you're coming at it from sort of the consumer perspective and certainly, a user can take their bank account routing number, make it available to an employer for paycheck deposit. I'm curious. Is there an opportunity to pursue another angle and going from the employer perspective to sort of partnering with employers or for that matter, platforms that have users or contractors and making Cash App available that way? And then Amrita, just quickly as it relates to the $873 million of PPP loans, how should we think of that financial impact for 2Q and kind of going forward? Okay. George, thanks for the question and the idea as well. I do think there's an opportunity. We have definitely tested this on our seller side with our payroll product, where employees can actually opt in to get paid via the Cash App. And the goal here is that we have more and more employees, especially a lot of part-time workers who might be working multiple jobs or multiple shifts going from seller to seller, driving the seller to use the payroll product so that we can actually – they can actually get paid in Cash App, which allows them to get access to their money much faster than a traditional payroll provider. So we do think there's more opportunity there, certainly in our ecosystem and beyond and certainly going to look for it. And George, on closing out on your PPP question, PPP for us is just – it's a powerful example of how Square can play a meaningful role in disbursing stimulus funds, as our sellers and their communities have been facing economic uncertainties. So as you noted, second quarter, $873 million of loans across 80,000 sellers. This is fairly significant scale for us, representing almost 40% or four and a half months of our capital loan volume from 2019 that we got done in about six weeks.
Regarding the mechanics of the economics, we used a bank partner to originate these PPP loans. The agencies we receive are capped at 1%, and the economics beyond that are based on whether we bring the loans on our balance sheet or sell the loans in the secondary market. In either of those categories, we earn lower revenue on these PPP loans than we would have on the typical core flex loan as the overall fees were capped by the SBA. For the loans we sold to investors, we shared in the economics and recognized most of the revenue upfront in the second quarter.
And for loans that we held on balance sheet, that $466 million, we retained a greater portion of the economics and recognize revenue over the life of a loan. There'll be a modest sort of quarterly contribution from those loans as we look forward. Great. Thank you. Thanks. I'd now like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. I would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our third quarter 2020 earnings call on November 5th. Thanks again for participating today.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. If you’re experiencing any technical difficulties accessing our third quarter 2020 shareholder letter, it is also available on the SEC’s website. We’ll begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of October. These represent our current estimate for October performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of October, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by auditors. As a result, actual October results may differ from these estimates.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason, and thank you all for joining us today. We know this is a busy time for everyone, especially with the U.S. election this week. So we’ll keep our opening comments focused so we can get to your questions.
As a company, we’re continuing to take action to further our purpose of economic empowerment and commitment to financial inclusion. Since last quarter, we announced two strategic investments that aligned with our purpose. The first was $100 million investment in support of minority and underserved communities, and towards our commitment to ending racial injustice. The second was a $50 million investment into Bitcoin, which we believe will be the native currency of the internet and help people around the world better participate and thrive in the economy.
A few updates on our two ecosystems, Seller and Cash App, before I turn it over to Amrita and your questions. Let’s start with Seller. We’re focused on providing sellers with fast and flexible access to their funds, which has proven to be especially important this year. Square Card, our business debit card, which we launched last year, provides sellers with a way to immediately access and spend earned funds without setting up a bank account. Adoption of Square Card has increased each quarter since launch. And in the third quarter, sellers spent more than $250 million on their cards.
We also work to provide employees easier access to funds. In the third quarter, we launched two new features for Square Payroll, Instant Payments and On-Demand Pay. Instant Payments allows Square Payroll merchants to pay employees using earned funds next business day with direct deposit or instantly when employees use Cash App. On-Demand Pay gives employees a way to get their compensation faster by transferring up to $200 of earned wages per pay period into their Cash App accounts. This strengthens the integration between our Seller and Cash App ecosystems, and it was a great example of what we can do when we connect the two ecosystems together.
We continue to believe our ecosystem is a key differentiator for sellers and see an opportunity to educate businesses who are looking to adapt. During the quarter we also ran our largest brand awareness campaign to-date with a focus on how our offerings can help sellers globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to reach more than 50 million people in the U.S. through our campaigns in the second half of 2020.
Now moving on to Cash App. For Cash App, we’ve continued to find ways to make financial services more relatable and accessible for individuals. We’ve seen strong adoption across the Cash App ecosystem, including our stock brokerage product, which has seen the fastest adoption of any product to-date. Since launching it less than a year ago, more than 2.5 million customers have bought stocks using Cash App and billions of dollars have been traded by the end of the third quarter.
With the stock products, we’re focused on expanding access to investing for more customers, many of whom likely have never purchased stocks before. This quarter we launched Auto-Invest, which allows for dollar-cost averaging from recurring daily or weekly purchase of Bitcoin or stocks. We also added the ability for customers to find stocks based on industry and performance, and to get relevant news about their stocks right in the app.
In closing, we have scaled not one but two ecosystems focused on expanding access to financial services for sellers and individuals. We intend to continue looking for opportunities within each ecosystem and to expand into new adjacencies beyond seller. We’re investing for the long-term and we’re energized by what’s possible.
And with that, over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are three topics I’d like to cover today. First, a look at our performance in the third quarter, where Cash App delivered strong growth and Seller achieved positive gross profit growth and showed stability on GPV. Second, an update on our business in October and what this could mean for growth going forward. Third, a look at where we intend to invest in the fourth quarter of 2020 and in 2021 across both ecosystems given the compelling opportunities ahead of us.
In the third quarter, gross profit was $794 million, up 59% year-over-year or 63% growth excluding Caviar. Net income was $37 million and adjusted EBITDA was $181 million. Cash App delivered incredible gross profit growth of 212% year-over-year. The $385 million in gross profit Cash App generated was more than triple of what it did in the third quarter of 2019. Cash App’s results highlight our ecosystem’s ability to help customers manage their finances.
Looking at the three main drivers; first, we continue to see strong acquisition of new customers to our platform each month with our highest number of new customers added in a quarter. Second, we continue to efficiently cross sell our broader ecosystem, increasing adoption of higher-value products such as Cash Card, Bitcoin and direct deposit. We found that customers who adopted two or more products and spend three to four times more gross profit compared to those who only use peer-to-peer payments and this adoption allow our customers to find growing daily utility in Cash App.
In the third quarter daily transacting actives nearly doubled year-over-year and represented nearly a quarter of Cash App monthly transacting actives. Third, we saw volume per active peak in July, as we benefited from increased inflows in the Cash App. This is a dynamic we’ve observed in the past related to seasonal past refunds, as well as direct deposits of recurring paychecks and fall to an even greater extent through July where the introduction of government stimulus funds. As expected influence stepped down from July, although remained relatively steady in August and September as we continue to benefit from greater inflows into customers’ accounts compared to pre-COVID level.
For our Seller ecosystem, gross profit was $409 million up 12% year-over-year, excluding 4th of July and Labor Day, seller GPV growth was relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis from July to August, followed by a modest improvement in September. Three factors to call out here in the third quarter, across key strategic areas for our Seller business. First, omnichannels remains a priority. Now online capabilities compliment our broader ecosystem. We saw continued strong GPV growth from our online channels up more than 50% year-over-year again in this quarter. Second, we saw stronger growth from our international markets in the third quarter, seller GPV in our markets outside the U.S. grew 46% year-over-year in the third quarter and represented 11% of total seller GPV up from 6% two years ago. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by easing of restrictions in various regions, as well as our strong acquisition of resellers.
Third, we remain focused on broadening our sales and marketing strategy for our Seller ecosystem. Overall across our increased go to market investments, we drove strong acquisitions similar to last quarter. We track acquisition looking at the first five weeks of gross profits from a new cohort and our seller cohorts in the third quarter generated greater gross profit compared to those who joined our platform a year ago.
Adjusted EBITDA of $181 million in the third quarter was primarily driven by top line growth and also benefited from a $40 million release of transaction loss provisions related to our Seller business. As actual loss rates trended more favorably than we had previously estimated.
Next, we wanted to share with you what trends we are seeing in real-time and implications on growth going forward for each ecosystem. In October, we expect Cash App gross profit growth of more than 160% year-over-year. We continue to grow the network through strong new customer acquisition, drive adoption of our products and healthy engagement and daily utility. As expected, we saw a reduction in transaction volume per active customer in October, driven by moderating inflows and stored funds, albeit still well above pre-COVID levels.
Looking ahead while the team has continued to execute, there remains a wide-range of outcomes related to government in flows and how consumer behavior normalizes in 2021, which could lead to Cash App gross profits decelerating during the remainder of this year and into 2021. Given Cash App incredible growth year-to-date in 2020, we will have particularly challenging comparisons in the second and third quarter of next year.
Turning to the Seller, in October we expect our Seller ecosystem to achieve year-over-year gross profit growth slightly ahead of the 12% growth Seller reported in the third quarter. Seller GPV was up 8% year-over-year in October, which modestly improved compared to the third quarter, which was up 4%. In our international markets we saw GPV growth of 50% year-over-year in October. However, two of our largest markets the UK and Canada recently implemented more targeted shelter-in-place measures, which could affect growth in the fourth quarter.
Card-not-present transactions were up 23% year-over-year in October, relatively consistent with what we saw during the third quarter, while card-present transactions were up 1% year-over-year an improvement from the third quarter. Regional trends on card-present transactions have varied depending on the extent of shelter-in-place restrictions. We expect to continue to observe variability related to the1 macro environment, pace of recovery and stricter shelter-in-place restrictions through the winter months, which could impact our performance.
Our Seller gross profit has grown faster than GPV this year, in part due to higher transaction margins, which benefited from a greater mix of debit card-not-present transactions and higher average transaction sizes. We recognize these dynamics driving transaction margins in 2020 could normalize in 2021.
Finally, we intend on investing for the long-term across both ecosystems in the fourth quarter and in 2021. And we’ll share a preliminary view of where we see the greatest opportunities. In the fourth quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss by at least $30 million compared to the third quarter. As we continue to invest in go-to market and hiring, particularly for engineers driving product development. As we plan for 2021, we again are making the deliberate decision to invest in both ecosystems. As we believe we are in the midst of a transformative opportunity to reach new customers and expand each of our ecosystems.
Next year, we expect to invest in incremental $800 million to $850 million in non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss, which represents growth of approximately 40% year-over-year. We expect the overall impact to our profitability in next year to depend on top-line growth trends in 2021, which will be determined in part by a variety of macro factors where we see a wide range of potential outcomes.
So what is in our control, let’s look at where we are investing in each ecosystem. For Cash App, we plan to focus on investing in sales and marketing to drive acquisition of customers and new demographics and to engage former customers. We also plan to invest in product development by continue adding value to our customers and support operations as the business scales.
For Seller, we plan to invest in sales and marketing to drive new seller acquisition and hiring among engineers to further out product roadmap as we grow up markets to serve larger sellers and as we look towards global expansion. We expect our blended company margin to be affected by the mix shift to Cash App.
As a reminder, Cash App represented nearly 50% of our business in the third quarter up from 25% a year ago. For the full year 2020, we expect Cash App to deliver more than 10 points of margin expansion and reach profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. So far this year Cash App has demonstrated strong unit economics and the ability to scale efficiently. However, as we look at the needs of our customers, the size of the addressable market and our team’s ability to move quickly, we see compelling opportunities to invest further. While Cash App has significantly improved its profitability, it is still a much hinder business and earlier in scaling its margin profiles than Seller.
In summary, we’re excited about the opportunity ahead of us to serve a wider set of needs for both new and existing customers across our ecosystems and intend to invest given a significant opportunity ahead of us to deliver a long-term profitable growth.
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thank you so much. Really a strong gross profit growth here. Just thinking about the drivers, I was wondering if maybe you can comment on customer acquisition versus higher customer engagement, not only in the quarter, but just looking ahead for both ecosystems. Amrita, I just heard you talking about sales and marketing stepping up, that makes sense, but I’m just curious how you’re balancing this customer acquisition versus engagement equation. Thanks. Sure. Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. Let me start by telling you where we are in the third quarter and in October on both business units in terms of these drivers, and then we can talk about where we’re continuing to invest into 2021. So first on the Seller business; in the third quarter, GPV was up 4%. Monthly growth is relatively stable throughout, improved in September and October, and then with a modest improvement to that 8% in October.
Some of the key drivers there. So first, obviously, COVID restrictions helping many of our businesses as they ease throughout the quarter, and we saw that impact our GPV, but we do want to be mindful on continued variability related restrictions. Second, retention. So you mentioned engagement. We kind of look on the Seller business at GPV retention for existing sellers, where we compare how sellers did in the prior year – from the prior year or doing this year.
But what we saw was that our GPV retention for existing sellers was down approximately 10% to 15% year-over-year in the third quarter and October. And it’s held relatively stable since July. We’re seeing improving retention in verticals, where restrictions were eases during the third quarter and October, such as beauty, professional services and health and fitness. And clearly we believe a primary driver of retention trends has been state-by-state restrictions, any impact on sellers’ ability to slowly reopen. When we saw certain states expanding reopenings in September and October to additional verticals, we saw corresponding improvements in GPV retention in those states.
And the third key driver was new customer acquisition. As you noted, we’ve seen encouraging trends in the Seller business in the second and third quarter, as we’ve seen growth in terms of new cohort sizes and aggregate gross profit, and we’ve been able to attract larger sellers over the past two quarters. You saw larger sellers increase to 61% of the share of total seller GPV in this last quarter, up 5 points year-over-year. And we want to lean in here behind the strong ROI historically over 3x on sales and marketing investments over three years, as well as new business formation, which is up strongly quarter-over-quarter.
Let me move next then to Cash App to telling you sort of the key drivers, some of which we talked about in the prepared remarks and clearly acquisition is a part of that. So Cash App saw very strong growth in the quarter, up 212%. The three key main drivers share that growth; first, new customer acquisition, as well as win-back. We’ve already attracted a lot of customers and bringing them back to the platform can oftentimes be more efficient. And with the network effects that we have, we have the ability to lean in and scale more quickly, particularly as we’ve seen values go up, we can invest differentially into this network.
Second, product adoption and engagement. We’ve seen continued strong attach on Cash Card, which is still at about one in four related to our monthly actives. And so we think there’s further room for growth here, as well as on new products like stock brokerage, which has 2.5 million customers now, and is our fastest product to ramp. And then third key driver of Cash App growth is strong volume per active, which as I mentioned, we saw peak in July before slowing down as we expected related to the falloff of government inflows.
Now as we look at 2021 based on all of that, where do we want to invest, you definitely heard from us that we want to lean in further to grow the networks of both of these businesses while continuing to work with existing customers, bringing them more value through additional products. We will, as I mentioned, be investing. We expect to invest in an incremental $800 million to $850 million in non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss, which is growth of about 40%. The way we expect that to break down that incremental spend is about half of it to go towards go-to-market investments, sales and marketing to both bring back lost customers as well as to focus on new customer growth across both ecosystems, that includes growing a sales team for Seller and leaning in further to our network effects on Cash App.
About a quarter of that stepped up investment, we will go towards product development, continuing to refine our existing products, as well as building new products into both ecosystems with a global focus. And then the final quarter, it goes towards G&A, including support and operations infrastructure to scale our businesses and particularly building in automation, AI and ML capabilities so that we can scale these sustainably going forward. Got it. Thanks for the complete answer. Good growth. Thank you. Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, guys. All right. I wanted to ask about Cash for Business. Very exciting. You broke out some new numbers this quarter, 10% of GPV. We love that because it’s a little two-sided network. Can you elaborate a little bit on where you’re gaining this traction with Cash for Business? And is it net new business or replacing some of your micro sellers?
And then also just a little bit more color on the economics, I know the take rates there are around that 2.75%. But is the funding mix here actually more attractive because it’s funding out of stored balances as well, any additional color there? Thank you. Hey, Lisa, thanks for the question. So the way to think about Cash for Business in terms of like, what we’re seeing in Seller adoption is, it’s very similar to the patterns we saw early on in the company’s history with the free reader. So we saw sellers, sole proprietors, smaller sellers, pick it up and use it in a variety of ways. What’s different about Cash for Business, of course is, it’s all digital and allows those sellers to manage their business through peer-to-peer transactions to their cash type. And it also provides them higher weekly limits and relevant tax reporting forms.
We did see a new pattern emerge during COVID-19 because it allows for contactless transactions with their buyers and with their customers. But we see proprietors like beauty, online retail, we’ve seen local businesses use it to collect donations. We think there’s a lot of opportunity here and we do believe that it’s quite powerful that the customers using Cash for Business transacting much more frequently across our ecosystem compared to other customers in Q3. So it, again, just strengthens the Cash App ecosystem and more broadly as some of those sellers graduate, they can also use the tools offered by the Seller business as well. And Lisa, just to weigh in on your question with respect to economics. So Cash App business GPV, which has composed primarily attached for business volumes as well as a small piece from peer-to-peer funded by credit card, Cash App business GPV was $2.9 billion, as you noted, about 9% of Square’s total reported GPV. And we see transaction revenue here of about $81 million. Both of those metrics were up more than 300% year-over-year in the quarter.
We monetize Cash for Business at 2.75% of volumes and these Cash App volumes did provide a benefit to our transaction margins as well, given the funding mix as you noted. We’re doing more work to understand our customer needs here, as Jack mentioned, and we recognize some of this uplifting growth may be related to COVID-specific trends that we will – that could potentially normalize and we’ll continue to monitor. Wonderful. Thank you. Thanks, Lisa. Your next question is from a Square Seller, Jared Sorensen. Please go ahead. Thank you. Yes. My business is about selling large gourmet cookies and my business name is Texas Cookie Shop. Currently when a customer comes in to the store, they can buy cookies either like one at a time or in boxes of six or a dozen. When I do sell a half dozen or a dozen, the POS will automatically add the volume discount. However, the website that I have does not. So I wanted to know is it on the roadmap to revive the shopping cart with similar automatic volume pricing options. Yes. Thank you, Jared. Thank you for being a customer as well. We do plan to enhance those on Square Online store to provide similar automatic pricing options as you mentioned in Square Point of Sale. The prerequisite functionality to support the feature is in development. So we’re going to work as fast as we can to get it out to you. And definitely appreciate any feedback on remaining gaps that might help you serve your customers better. Yes, that’d be perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. And your next question is from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the question. All right. My question is a follow-up on the update you gave on the Square Card earlier this afternoon. It’s a topic that’s also somewhat related to my question last quarter, around the SMB digital banking opportunity for Square. So you noted the volume has ramped up to $250 million this quarter, and that math suggests it’s in the ballpark give or take about 1% of seller volume. So it seems like a long runway ahead, and I was hoping you could give maybe some added thoughts on some of the things that either you have been doing or can do to address this opportunity. It does seem like a long runway for a product that really seems to be a win-win for the sellers and for Square. We agree completely. And the way to think about the Square Card is kind of in that vein of a use case of getting people, whether they’d be individuals or sellers, faster access to their funds. It just matters so much. And that’s what Square Card represents is sellers get to utilize their money much faster. Since launch we’ve seen adoption in growing with more sellers using it each quarter. We saw sellers using a card upon joining Square. And in the third quarter, 50% of the Square Card sellers ordered their cards within the first month of onboarding, which is pretty incredible. And we’re seeing sellers use the card for everyday expenses like gas stations and discount retailers, their own inventory.
So we’re watching very closely the patterns in terms of how people are using it, where we can improve it, what we can build on top of the card or adjacent to the card. But there’s a vein in this use case of cash flow management of enabling faster access to funds is very rich for us. And they’ll come in many manifestations, and Square Card, it’s just one of the latest and definitely excited about their performance recently. And from a revenue perspective, Square Card’s relatively small today. We expect it to ramp over multiple years, both for new merchants and increased monetization from the existing base as we add those new features to help sellers manage their balance. Similar to the dynamic we’ve seen on the Cash App ecosystem, the card enables people to keep their funds and sellers to keep their funds within our ecosystem, which leads to higher customer lifetime value. So it’s something we’re encouraged to keep building out. Yes, that makes a ton of sense. Thank you so much both of you for the answers there. A brief follow-up, we don’t have to spend too much time on this, but you did mention the retention ratio is kind of similar to July and for the Seller business at down 10% to 15%. And when I just look at the positive volume growth, it just implies to that gap there, it really implies a pretty big new cohort that comes on, and you’ve characterized a little bit talking about how they’re generally larger sellers, higher gross profit. I know it’s hard to say because most of these sellers are self-onboarding, but if you could give any context that you might have around what these sellers might’ve been doing before, given their size, I’m assuming that they were probably already accepting payments in some way. Look, when you look at the opportunity ahead of us, we’ve sized our TAM and materials earlier this year, we think the vast majority of the market, especially in larger seller market is being addressed today on legacy platforms, legacy infrastructure and platforms that we believe aren’t as flexible as ours can be with integrated payments, financial services, hardware software. And we did see growth in our larger seller cohorts. If you look at larger seller GPV, it’s about 13% growth year-over-year relative to the entire base at 4% growth year-over-year. And we do believe that’s related to stronger acquisition of larger seller cohorts as we mentioned onboarding in both the third quarter and second quarter. So we believe that our unique platform has a real opportunity to address these larger, more complex seller needs through multiple different products that we can offer. Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks. Nice job on the quarter. I wanted to just to hone in on beyond just obviously Cash for Business being a big driver of volume right now. We saw some pretty material growth in the online side or really just card-not-present again, up, I think it was 24% versus 16% last quarter. If you could just talk a little more on the strategy there, and maybe just the other big driver being international, which again, you guys talked about I think it was 46%. Maybe just if you don’t mind honing in a little more on the strategic initiatives on both those sides, how big can it get as a percentage of mix in the next couple of years? Maybe I can kick us off. It sounds like you’re looking for some more color around online and international, and we’ve seen strong traction in both areas as you noted. And then in the third quarter, we saw continued strength in GPV from our online channel, which grew over 50% year-over-year consistent with the growth we’ve seen on average over the past year and a half. And then when you combine the two, when you look at online channel growth outside of the U.S., and our international markets, that was even stronger at over 60% in the third quarter, driven by strong adoption of e-commerce API, invoices, Square Online, the variety of online products, so we provide the compliment that broader ecosystem.
And as you look at Square Online as a front door now for us, we’re also seeing encouraging trends there, where one and two new signups to Square Online are new to Square more broadly in October. I think last quarter we had told you one and three, and so we’ve seen some improvement in that as well, where we can help our customers from an omnichannel perspective, including these online products and features. And just on the international side, global growth remains a top priority for both ecosystems. But just looking at Seller for a minute, since the beginning of our expansion and through the end of 2020, we will have had 85 product launches in the four markets we serve across hardware, software and our financial service offerings. And just for example, we recently launched Square for Retail in the UK and Australia, and Square Online in Japan. So we want to continue to make sure that our product offerings that we have in the U.S., are rolled out to the rest of our markets as well, and of course always evaluating additional markets for potential expansion as well.
And Cash App in terms of global growth, it is also a priority for us, a top priority for us. We launched in the UK, we also launched cross broader payments between the U.S. and UK. And we think there’s a lot of potential here. We acquired a company called Verse in Spain, which allows – gives us an opportunity to learn from the peer-to-peer growth in European markets. So right now we continue to add all these aspects that help us learn and to really make sure that we’re expanding around the world in a smart way. Okay. I mean, it does look like there’s inflection in international. That’s great to see, guys. Thank you. Thank you so much. Your next question is from the line of Rayna Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Good evening, Jack and Amrita. Thanks for taking my question. Can you discuss your recent thoughts on capital allocation and specifically your appetite for acquisitions? Maybe what types of acquisitions interests you the most today and which businesses would be most additive to Square? Thank you. Well, I’ll take the first part. I mean, we definitely have an appetite for acquisitions both in terms of products and also great teams. We’ve shown some examples of like the categories that we’re looking at. We certainly want to continue to add more force behind some of the trends that we’re seeing within our space, such as artificial intelligence, and also cryptocurrency and specifically Bitcoin. We’ve certainly looked at multiple products that we can learn from and as we add to the company we have much more from core competing offering. So we are constantly looking for great teams or great products that complement our adjacent to our key ecosystems in Seller and Cash App. And we want to make sure that, we’re pretty open not just with the acquisitions in U.S. but also abroad. Because great companies are being more and more found all over the world. And Rayna, I will just jump in the capital allocation piece of it. Obviously the key piece of that is, where we’re investing internally and ensuring that we maintain discipline and we are going after the biggest opportunity.
So I had mentioned earlier that step up as investments next year $800 million to $850 million, we expect majority of that to go towards our ecosystem, about 60% directed to Cash App and about 40% directed to Seller, while also leaving some room to test and learn around the other new strategic investment areas. Within Seller, we expect to grow our sales and marketing investments by 40% to 45% year-over-year in 2021 across brand and the awareness marketing to drive top of funnel demand, doubling the size of our sales headcount next year and our account management teams to address larger seller needs and where we’ve seen efficient returns even during COVID this year.
And that increasingly global focus that we’ve mentioned to pulling these campaigns across international markets from a product development standpoint within Seller. And we want to build out this engineering data science design teams who can expand that ecosystem and amongst other things focus on some of the products that each larger sellers like our vertical specific features and develop our APIs as well as bringing those products more globally.
And then finally on Cash App, the step up of investment there, we talked about acquisition and win-back, we’ve already started deploying this year an increased investment around paid marketing, and we’ve seen strong returns on that with payback at less than a year. And again, with low customer acquisition costs and growing our lifetime value, we see strong returns on these investments.
From a support perspective, Cash App has rapidly scaled this year, and customers are increasingly using Cash App for broader services beyond peer-to-peer. So we intend on scaling our support and other operations infrastructure for the business in 2021. We expect the magnitude of this step up to be one-time in nature, and we envision operating leverage in this area in the future because of the investments in things like AI and machine learning to drive automation and efficiency.
And then finally product development on Cash App, the team has delivered strong product velocity over the years with a mix of major new launches as well as adding a feature development and we expect to continue to do that in the near future. Very helpful. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Amrita thanks for the color on the potential for tougher comps in second quarter and I know it’s challenging. And stripping out the impact of stimulus that you’ve seen, but I guess looking at growth in customer funds, at least sequentially, I think it was up 78% in the quarter. Should we think of that as at least on the Cash App side is an underlying growth rate for the existing base, I’m trying to exclude the big rapid spending and the new customer acquisition that you had set for it. Do you see that as a good level that investors should think about going forward, at least for the next quarter or two? Hey, Pete, thanks for the question. Maybe we can talk about the number, I think you were talking about stored funds which were up for Cash App, which were up 78% quarter-over-quarter, correct me if you’re wrong that’s the number. That’s correct. Yes. Okay. Yes. Look stored funds for us is one indicator of the use of the Cash App platform. And obviously it’s a factor of inflows into the platform and outflows from the platform. The more we can keep our customer, we can deliver value to our customer base through a variety of products, including Cash Card, investing, et cetera. The more we have the ability to give people a reason to store their funds within Cash App. We do recognize as you noted the impact of stimulus, which drove us to sort of peak levels in terms of stored funds. We were in about $2 billion in stored funds in July, before seeing a decrease in October at about $1.75 billion in stored funds down about 10% from July to October.
And we think that, that’s likely related to influence related to these sorts of government funds. And that’s why we noted on the call that in the absence of further government funds, we can see normalization around. And we’re already seeing normalization around that one driver of volumes per active, and could expect to see further deceleration there for the remainder of Q4 and into 2021.
And, again would think about the Cash App business on a two-year basis here to help normalize for some of the acceleration we saw in this year, Cash App has delivered over 170% gross profit growth year-to-date on a year-over-year basis this year. And so we may see those trends normalize over time and would look at things from the 2019 to 2021 basis to normalize for some of that growth. That’s helpful. And just as a quick follow-up. I know there was a big discretionary spend this last quarter, new acquisition growth. How are you seeing adoption of Cash Card? I know that typically a quick add up for a new Cash App user initially, are you seeing similar take up levels when you’re signing on a new Cash App user converting to Cash Card? Yes, I think we noted in our quarter – in the earnings call last quarter, that we had seen faster product adoption amongst new customers, those new cohorts of customers, as we noted in our 2Q call on Cash App and not included for things like Cash Card. As of the end of June, we had over 7 million monthly actives on Cash Card and the majority of them spending over five times per week in June. And we’ve seen strong engagement since – we obviously saw that play out in the quarter for us as well. And we think that there’s more to do here.
Cash Card has achieved strong adoption at nearly one in four of our monthly actives using Cash Card on a monthly basis in June. And we think that there’s even more that we can do in terms of surfacing Cash Card and the Boost product and related features to our customers in an even greater way as we move forward. Thank you, really helpful. Thank you. Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about whether you have any initiatives or plans in place to build out a broader kind of B2B product set, I guess especially in Seller. It seems like that type of a thing like AP, AR automation, supplier payments, would fit like a glove in terms of what you’re already offering your customers. Just curious what your view is on the B2B opportunity for Square. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think there is a lot of opportunity. And we certainly were kind of pulling at this thread when we launched the Square Card by incentivizing Square Merchants to shop with other Square Merchants. So there is something there that we’re excited about and there is a pattern in a use case that we want to watch more closely, but we have nothing to talk about today.
Right now we continue to focus on like the most critical aspects to run the business to better serve customers and also a lot around customer relationship management. But as we continue to make that more robust, there are certainly adjacencies that are very interesting in something that we’ll look deeply at. Terrific. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Hi, it’s James with Susquehanna. I noticed, Amrita you released some reserves, if you could describe where you are in that journey, it was a bigger conversation, obviously earlier in the year. Any update there would be helpful. Thank you. Sure. Happy to help with that. Overall in the third quarter, transaction and loan loss expenses were $15 million down 54% year-over-year with that decline primarily driven by the $49 release of an existing provision for the Seller business related to the first half of the year, which more than offset the increase in provisions related to the third quarter.
And when you look on a year-to-date basis for Seller, in 2020 transaction losses as a percentage of GPV is trending at about 1.7x, what we would have seen in terms of a quarterly average in 2019. This is above the 3x that we had estimated back in the second quarter, and that reflects our current provision level for risk loss on these cohorts year-to-date. To break that down across the various cohorts first quarter and then second and third quarters. For the first quarter our transaction risk loss trends have now matured.
Transaction losses represented an increase of about 1.2 times year-over-year on a dollar basis. And for the second and third quarters, we’re now positioned at about two times greater on a year-over-year basis on a dollar basis, given the ongoing uncertainty for those more recent cohorts. Let me know if that answered your question, Jamie.
Obviously future provisions, we are going to depend on a bunch of puts and takes that we’re going to continue to monitor related to broader macro environment. That’s great. Thank you very much. Thanks. Your next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KBCM. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the question. Yes. I found the commentary around really needs new cohorts that you’re bringing in on the Seller side are actually seems to be contributing more than the similar cohorts a year ago. It certainly seems like the number of products that Cash App users are adopting is up. So just would like to hear a little bit about maybe how that influences the LTV to CAC equation and really how that is influencing your investment philosophy as we move forward. Sure. Maybe starting just on what we’re seeing so far with the stepped up investments in go to market for the Seller business. We increased our investments meaningfully in the third quarter, as we had told you in last earnings call, excluding Cash App other sales and marketing expenses which is primarily reflective of the pace of seller investments were up 63% year-over-year on GAAP basis.
What we were doing was we launched an awareness marketing campaign across a range of new channels, including TV, radio, podcasts, et cetera and we expect to reach through those channels, 50 million people in the second half of this year. These campaigns really tell a broader story on the ecosystem and it specifically speaks to larger sellers in terms of the range of products that we have to meet their needs. These campaigns do have longer payback periods than performance marketing, but we’ve also seen that they drive top of funnel interests which allows us to scale performance marketing. And we see further opportunity to do that in 2021 as well.
And then similarly sales and account management teams have generated efficient paybacks in 2020. We’re doubling the size, as I mentioned, the sales team in 2021. And that’s helped us reach more and more larger sellers, which now account for 61% of seller GPV. When we think about reaching these larger sellers, who can take on more products with us that certainly has an impact on lifetime value, which is why we want to measure these investments against ROI. And look at that sort of longer-term duration of a partnership with the seller and how we can deliver value to them and see increased value from those sellers, which enables us to lean-in even further to that.
From a Cash App perspective where we’ve been investing, it’s been about a year now since our first paid ads for Cash App, we launched them for the first time in December of 2019. And with our ARPU and lifetime values up, 3x over the past three years. We are seeing significant room to scale marketing spend still at very strong ROI. We ramped paid marketing for Cash App in the third quarter and into October with low customer acquisition costs across a variety of new channels. And we are seeing compelling payback so far on that acquisition spend at less than a year. Of course, a key piece of that is related to the ability to drive stronger value into the ecosystem and therefore stronger ARPU and lifetime value of these customers, which becomes a flywheel. It enables us to invest more both into the product and into the go to market. Really helpful. Thanks Amrita. Welcome. Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you see as the role of QR code, in retail generally, but maybe in restaurants in particular whether that’s a capability Square is going to progressively support at any point? Yes. So on the Seller side, we had self-serve ordering capabilities by QR code and that integrates with the restaurant’s kitchen and payment systems. We also have QR codes built into to the Cash App and are seeing really strong adoption in usage there. Generally I think it’s just a function of the speed of the ORS and how easy the OS makes this adoption. Obviously, other markets have adopted it very strongly, but we have all the functionality in place and as people get more and more comfortable using it, especially in the U.S. I imagine we’ll see more, but I do think it is a broader function of how fast it is versus other technologies, certainly competing with NFC as well, which is pretty fast. But we want to make sure that a Seller and an individual using Cash App has every available tool to them so they can meet their customers wherever that happened to be. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. And the final question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi guys, congrats on the results. I just wanted to ask or just follow-up, and ask about further penetrating insight of Cash Card and direct deposit. What are some of the things you can do to help drive that penetration even higher? I know Cash Card is at 25% today, but it feels like there’s some room to push that higher. I think you mentioned maybe Boost and some other things, and maybe that’s part of the spent next year to get that adoption up. Thanks so much. Maybe I can start-off on this one. I think there’s a couple of different ways that we can approach driving Cash Card. And you mentioned direct deposit, you mentioned Boost, we view these products as working together as an ecosystem. And it’s part of our work to surface these products in a straightforward and frictionless way to our customers. With respect to direct deposit, we have seen steady month-over-month growth in the number of customers depositing their recurring paychecks, which continued into the third quarter.
We know that direct deposit customers typically pull more funds, they have pulled more funds in the Cash App, they store higher balances, they have adopted more products including Cash Card, where they typically spend multiples more than other Cash Card actives do. All of which has driven monetization of lifetime value for that direct deposit customer. So we do see strong correlation of these products driving usage into other products in this example direct deposit and the Cash Card. So we continue to focus on developing the features around both products and the broader ecosystem together. Great. Thank you. And I’d now like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you everyone for joining our call. And would like to remind everyone that we will be hosting our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call on February 23, 2021. Thanks again for participating today.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause the results to differ. Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
During this call, we'll provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the months of January-February. These represents our gross profit, gross results for January and current estimate for February performance. These numbers are not final as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of February, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by auditors.
As a result, actual January and February results may differ from these estimates. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I'd like to turn over to Jack. Thanks, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2020 was a tough year for many. Our focus was to help our customers through it all which required us to adapt and evolve quickly. I believe this is an important attribute for any organization and I'm proud we continued to demonstrate that. We also took the opportunity to act more broadly by announcing our plans for our operations to be carbon net zero by 2030, and launched our bitcoin clean energy and net investment initiative, a $10 million commitment to support companies that will help drive adoption and efficiency of renewables within the bitcoin ecosystem.
We plan to reinvest any gains back into the funds and are exploring opening it up for participation by like-minded companies. We'll share more details on our environmental and social initiatives next month in our 2020 corporate social responsibility report. In addition today, we announced $170 million purchase of bitcoin on top of the $50 million we bought in the fourth quarter. Why are we doing this? We believe the internet needs a native currency, and we believe bitcoin is it.
We believe it has highest the probability of empowering more people in the economy in a fair way. We're doing a lot to ensure this from a product, open source development and open patent perspective and by us owning bitcoin, our incentives are aligned with skin in the game. And now for some updates on our business. Cash App continue to see strong adoption both from new and existing customers. In December, Cash App had more than $36 million monthly active customers, up 50% compared to last year.
We saw customers increase their usage of products beyond peer-to-peer transactions, including use of our Visa Cash Card, Cash Boost and bitcoin. Boost is our instant rewards program within our Cash Card that enables customers to receive unique discounts based on their location and other attributes. In the fourth quarter, active Boost customers spent double that of other Visa Cash Card customers. We also recently launched a special Boost, which a customer locks up to receiving their first paycheck in the Cash App and a bitcoin boost, giving people a way to earn bitcoin on all Cash Card purchases.
As more of the world has discovered the value of bitcoin, Cash App continued its focus to make bitcoin more accessible and more useful. One example of this is enabling people to change the default denomination unit from BTC to Satoshis, which is 100 millionth of a bitcoin also known as SATs to help people realize you don't have to own a full bitcoin and can stack SATs instead. In the fourth quarter, bitcoin coin volumes per customer increased more than 2.5x compared to the same period last year, mostly driven by buying activity of both existing and new customers. In 2020, more than 3 million customers bought or sold bitcoin in Cash App. And in January 2021 alone, more than 1 million customers bought bitcoin for the first time.
Our Seller ecosystem continued to grow of market and attract larger sellers as we saw mid-market sellers use 2.5 of our products on average in 2020. Nearly all mid-market sellers use our team management product to schedule staff and view real-time performance and sales analytics for their workforces. And in 2020, approximately half of our mid-market GPV came from sellers with integrations into our developer platform, which enables the data driven way to process payments using custom software, building e-commerce experiences and connect with existing business systems.
Our sales team has played an important role in our growth of market. In the fourth quarter, 40% of mid-market seller GPV came from sellers who had been engaged by our sales team. The team also focuses on educating existing sellers about our broader ecosystem. We use machine learning to identify sellers most likely to adopt more products and which of our solutions are likely to be most relevant. This help drive a 15% increase in product adoption among existing mid-market sellers in 2020. We plan to continue this work and intend to double our sales team in 2021.
So what’s our focus for the year ahead? For Cash App, we’re going to focus on increasing the transaction limits across the ecosystem, expand our deposit capabilities and increase the quality of our customer service, all in order to strengthen our foundation and reach new customers. We’re also going to double down on our commitment to bitcoin and continue to look for new ways to connect our product lines within the Cash App. For the seller business, we will continue focus on growing our omnichannel capabilities, expand globally and increase our financial service offerings to sellers of all sizes.
And with that, over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are three topics I’d like to cover today. First, a look at our performance in 2020 and in the fourth quarter where we delivered strong gross profit growth. Second, an update on our business through mid-February and what this could mean for growth going forward. Third, a look at our cohort economics for Cash App and Seller, which give us confidence to invest for the long-term. Despite 2020 being a year of extreme uncertainty, our results in the fourth quarter and full year speaks to our ability to both help new customers adapt during a dynamic environment and reach new customers. In 2020, gross profit was $2.73 billion, up 45% year-over-year, or 48% excluding Caviar.
It was a year of strong growth where we improved our gross profit growth rate over 2019 and also diversified our ecosystems. Seller generated $1.51 billion of gross profit in 2020, an increase of 8% compared to 2019. Our online channels delivered more than 50% GPV growth year-over-year and became a growing portion of our mix. Cash App delivered incredible growth in 2020, up more than 2.5 times year-over-year to $1.23 billion in gross profit and now represents nearly half of the company’s gross profit. We have continued to diversify Cash App business model with scale. In 2019, Cash App had only one revenue stream with $100 million in gross profit and in 2020 we had four with approximately $100 million or more each of which grew at over 100% year-over-year.
2020 was also a year that we invested in our business and in our customers with compelling returns. We invested in our customers in a variety of ways including by accelerating critical product launches, allowing sellers to pause software subscriptions, helping sellers and individuals, access government funds and providing useful rewards for Cash App customers through Boost at a time they needed it most. We also invested in our business by continuing to build out our teams to drive product innovation and by deploying go-to-market initiatives to expand our reach.
Let’s now turn to the fourth quarter, where gross profit was $804 million, up 52% year-over-year or 54% growth excluding Caviar. Looking at some of the drivers for the quarter, first, we’re seeing growing engagement and monetization with Cash App. In the fourth quarter, Cash App generated $377 million in gross profit, an increase of 162% year-over-year. Cash App benefits from the compounding effects of growing our customer base while also increasing engagement and monetization per customer. We saw these dynamics drive growth in the fourth quarter as we scaled our network to more than 36 million monthly transacting customers, an increase of 50% year-over-year. At the same time, we increased gross profit per monthly transacting active customer by 70% year-over-year to $41 in the fourth quarter.
By expanding the breadth of our product ecosystem, refining features and continuing to build on our foundation, we’ve driven greater engagement across our ecosystem. In 2020 and the fourth quarter, we increased adoption across all of our products beyond peer-to-peer for Cash App. Newer customers are coming to Cash App for our ecosystem as they have increasingly adopted multiple products such as Cash Card and bitcoin within their first month after on-boarding.
Moving to Seller, where our omnichannel offerings are driving growth, gross profit in the fourth quarter was $427 million, up 13% year-over-year with Seller GPV up 6% year-over-year. To help sellers adapt during the pandemic, we have continued to build-out our omnichannel capabilities and these offerings have gained meaningful traction. Omnichannel and online sellers represented more than half of Seller GPV in the fourth quarter, which is up from one-third two years ago.
Our mid-market category, which consists of Seller with more than $0.5 million in annual GPV, is where we see our largest market opportunity for the Seller business and a focus area for our acquisition efforts. We saw strength here in the fourth quarter, despite the impact of the pandemic. Gross profit from our mid-market sellers grew 27% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 times the gross profit growth of our overall Seller business.
Looking at profitability, adjusted EBITDA was $185 million in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by gross profit growth and also benefited from the release of $43 million in transaction loss provisions related to our Seller business as actual loss rates trended more favorably than we had previously estimated.
Next, we wanted to share early trends in our Cash App and Seller businesses during the first quarter and what this could mean for growth going forward. In January, Cash App delivered gross profit growth of 164% year-over-year, a two-point improvement from the fourth quarter. We achieved strong acquisition of customers and drove increased product adoption with our highest monthly total of new transacting active customers for bitcoin, stock brokerage and Cash Card.
January growth benefited from government fund disbursements, which began during the last few days of December and led to an increase in fund pulled in to Cash App. These fund trends during the first three weeks of February; we estimate Cash App gross profit growth to be approximately 130% year-over-year. Growth in February decelerated compared to January or the impact from government funded disbursements normalized partly offset by continued strength in acquisition and peer to peer network volumes.
We are watchful of broader macro trends and any new policies, which could influence the pace of growth. As a reminder, we will start lapping particularly challenging growth comparisons in the second and third quarter of this year. In January, our Seller ecosystem achieved 15% gross profit growth, a 2 point improvement from the fourth quarter and GPV grew 5% year-over-year. Through the first three weeks of February, Seller GPV was up 2% year-over-year, a 3 point deceleration from January, but excluding the temporary impact of recent weather across regions in the US, we estimate seller GPV growth would have been comparable to January and we have seen an improvement in certain regions where restrictions have eased.
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to observe variability related to the macro environment and regional shelter-in-place restriction, which could impact our performance. We will also begin to lap the initial impact of the pandemic on the Seller business in late March. Seller gross profit grew faster than GPV in 2020, in part due to higher transaction margins, which benefited from a greater mix of debit card-not-present transaction, higher average transaction sizes and from our card present price change implemented in November 2019. We expect to lap these mix changes for transaction margins and for transaction margins to normalize towards the end of the first quarter, so GPV may grow faster than transaction profit as in person transactions resume in future quarters.
Finally, in 2021, we are investing for long-term profitable growth. Given the opportunity ahead of us, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss by 41% year-over-year or an incremental $800 million to $900 million compared to 2020 levels. We intend on continuing to invest where we see attractive returns, even in the face of their ability and macro trends.
And as a result, adjusted EBITDA margins may vary depending on top line growth. Both our Cash App and Seller ecosystems had delivered strong cohort economics, including acquisition, retention, paybacks, and returns on investment. Cash App has proved out and scaled a strong business model. We have acquired new transacting active customers for less than $5 on average in paid marketing through 2020.
For existing customers, we've increased their engagement over time with gross profit retention of more than 130% for each of the last three years. As a result, we've achieved strong returns on investment of 6 times or greater over a three-year period with 2020 cohorts pacing ahead of even this and we intend to ramp up investments into new marketing channels and strategies in 2021.
We have also been encouraged by Sellers’ cohort economics. We saw strong customer acquisition in 2020 on-boarding our largest cohort as new sellers on a gross profit basis, which is pacing at an estimated five-quarter payback. In the midst of the pandemic in 2020 gross profit retention stabilized down approximately 10% year-over-year in the second half of the year. Our more recently acquired Seller cohorts have seen a stronger rebound in gross profit than older cohorts, which is partly driven by stronger acquisition of larger sellers in recent years.
Prior to the pandemic, Seller had achieved positive gross profit retention and returns on investment of 3 times over three years as Sellers stayed with Square and grew their businesses with us. Looking ahead to a recovery, we plan to continue investing behind these strong returns to reach new sellers and drive growth.
In summary, we remain committed to our purpose of economic empowerment by continuing to serve our existing customers and reaching those in new markets. We’re focused on driving long-term profitable growth and are eager to invest behind the compelling returns for both our Cash App and Seller ecosystems.
I’ll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Thanks so much. Nice to speak to you all. Just a lot of good information here. I have a big picture, maybe a simple question on priorities. If you’re investing a lot, it seems to make sense here. Are you prioritizing user acquisition first followed by improving engagement or product development across both ecosystems, given what you’re talking about here with low CAC and big ROI? I can definitely make the argument for you guys to spend more. So just your thoughts on acquisition versus engagement here in 2021? Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. We have historically shown an ability to do both. When you think about our TAM expansion over the years from our last Investor Day in 2017 to our more recently disclosed TAM opportunity of $160 billion, we’ve grown TAM by $100 billion, $40 billion on the Seller business with new product launches, new geographic expansions and $60 billion on the Cash App ecosystem. And we see an opportunity for further TAM expansion, investments in new products and in new markets and all of that is while also growing the base of our customers.
Cash App grew by 50% in terms of monthly transacting customers at the end of this year to $36 million and we on-boarded our largest cohort of Square sellers during 2020 with each quarter growth on a year-over-year basis for our cohorts that we’ve added. So we see an opportunity in both areas and we’ve shown again a track record of focus on both expansions of opportunity as well as going deeper in our existing markets.
Maybe I’ll explain a little bit about what we’re seeing in terms of cohort economics that lead us to continue to want to invest in both areas. So as you mentioned, we’re planning to invest $800 million to $900 million in terms of incremental investments in 2021, that’s roughly 50% of that step-up will go towards sales and marketing and about a quarter of it will go towards R&D across both ecosystems.
The final piece will go towards G&A, which continues to build on the foundation for the company. But as we think about that sales and marketing growth, what’s giving us the desire and confidence to lean in here are the cohort economics, which are really compelling as you think about the combination of both efficient acquisition and engagement on the existing products that we have let alone engagement on the products that we could be building in the future, we are building for the future.
With Cash App, we’ve seen a 6x ROI over three years on the back of efficient acquisition at less than $5 per customer, again calling upon our network effects – very strong network effects that where we’ve seen strong volumes in peer-to-peer and that continues to be a strong front door for us. But then also very strong gross profit retention at over 130% for each in the last three years as we’ve maintained the vast majority of our customers and they’ve grown on our platform.
For the Seller business similarly, we’ve seen cohort economics pacing at five-quarter payback, 3x return on ROI over three years and historically prior to the pandemic, positive gross profit retention. So we see an opportunity in terms of the cohort economics that we’re driving to continue to lean in.
And finally, we do see an opportunity to drive further engagement with our existing products. When we think about as we mentioned within the Seller ecosystem continued increasing next to our mid-market sellers, larger sellers who tend to adopt more products, 2.5 products today, so we see an opportunity for uplift. When our sales team uses AI and ML technology, they see a 15% uplift in product adoption.
And similarly for Cash App, we’ve seen in the first months that our Cash App customers on-board into our ecosystems, an increasing proclivity to adopt new products like stocks, like Bitcoin, like Cash Card, but there is so much more opportunity here, as we think about increasing product adoption for our current customer set to go even deeper to provide daily utility to those customers. So we’re really focused on both and have showed a track record here driving both acquisition engagement along with broader TAM expansion. For sure. Appreciate the thoughts and metrics. Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. All right. Hey, thanks guys, and congrats on a good year, a tough – obviously tough environment for everybody. But when we look at omni-channel and online being greater than 50% of total Seller GPV, clearly online and card not present experiences are resonating, and we saw 12% GPV growth overall, including cash or business, and obviously held by that mid-market for larger business client.
I think it was up 27% there. Can you just touch on what's resonating with both consumers on the merchant side and Square's offerings enabling this, because the move from what – previously being much more card-present center to where you are now, 50% omni has been pretty dramatic? And when we think about all of that, where do you see that going in terms of sustainability and investments you can make in that to keep that level of really sustainable 50% plus potentially. Thanks, guys. Hey Darrin, thanks for that question. So omni-channel is a really big part of our strategy, because it's not just focused on serving e-commerce or offline, it's looking for opportunities in every single way that a business might attract customers. That's through marketplaces, it's through API. I think the most attractive thing is really its flexibility. We are now seeing a lot more of our mid-market sellers and larger sellers, utilize our APIs and platforms so that they can build a custom solution and really make sure that they're crafting the experience that they want.
We think there's a continued great opportunity here. That is going to be a big part of our focus on our roadmap for some time as we add new capabilities to the platform, as we add new methods and new channels for people to sell in. The second part that I think differentiates us is we're not just focused on one vertical. We are flexible enough to handle any vertical.
And as I talked about on previous calls a lot of what we're seeing today is creativity with Sellers. They're mixing and mashing up different verticals to have typically restaurant type businesses who are doing more retail things and vice versa and services are doing more retail. And we don't really take a point of view on what category you should be. We're going to make sure that we're just there to help you make the sale no matter what you're trying to sell on whatever channel you're trying to sell it with.
So obviously, we saw a lot of this momentum with COVID, as people opened their eyes towards the rest of our platform, and we quickly reprioritize a lot of our efforts to make sure that we could support that growth and that we could enable more of it. But I don't think that behavior is necessarily going away. I think in before COVID, there were a lot of merchants who were hesitant to try new things or the thing that was working they wanted to stick with. But it was a forcing function that people allowed themselves to open their eyes to more and they found a lot more efficiency and they found a lot more sales because of it. So we're going to continue watching and learning, but we think this is a pretty stable path for us. And Darrin just to add – yes, just to add to your point about investments and sustainability, we've seen over 50% growth from our some GPV from our online channels for about two years now, now in 2020, we saw an acceleration in that Square Online growth compared to 2019. And we're going to continue to push there in terms of our product development and feature richness.
When you think about mid-market as well to your point, that's our larger sellers now are 60% of seller GPV in the fourth quarter up from 52%, two years ago and with gross profit from mid-market outpacing the blended seller average by 2 times, and with our cohorts now coming in indexing to larger, we see an opportunity to continue to invest against the larger ecosystem. When we think about addressable market for larger sellers where at less than 1% penetrated in that opportunity, and there's three areas of investment to help us unlock that. First is marketing, which has talked about awareness marketing around the broader ecosystem are coupled with product specific campaigns, targeting the products that resonate with larger sellers, whether it's vertical points of sale, online, restaurants, et cetera.
Second is a sales team. We'll be doubling the size of our sales team in 2021. So that we can continue to increase our outbound research – outreach to larger sellers. And then third, product, as Jack mentioned, our developer platform is really key for serving more complex seller needs, our vertical software additionally, these are some of the areas that we'll be increasingly investing in to drive further opportunity here. That's really helpful. Thanks, Amrita. Thanks, guys. Now question from Cash App customer – I'm sorry if I mispronounced it, Ignacio Diaz Garza. Hello, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Ignacio Diaz Garza, and I'm a Cash App and I'm a Founder of a surfing platform called OANDA. I use Cash App to invest in stocks and Bitcoin, send money to friends, as well as spending using the Cash Card. My question is this Cash App plan to provide more education for customers and its investing product. For example, adding more end up financials, analyst ratings, and research reports regarding the stock. Yes. Thank you for being a customer. We do plan on adding more educational resources. We think a big part of what we did both with Bitcoin and also with our stocks product is making sure that people had the information available to them to make informed decisions. And we’ve done this recently by putting news articles right in the app. So you’ll be able to see all the latest Bitcoin news or all the latest news on any particular stock that you visit. And we created two instructional books for both Bitcoin and for stocks. And we think there’s a lot of opportunity to do even more within the product. And also as we look at improving our customer service, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there’s going to be more opportunity to do things there as well. So we think education is a big part of what we need to do and it’s definitively on the road down. Perfect. Thank you so much. Your next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good stats here on Cash App. I believe a year ago, the gross profit mix within Cash App was roughly 60% instant deposit if I’m remembering right, 30% Cash Card and about 10% in Bitcoin and other miscellaneous fees. But obviously a lot has happened in the last year. And I know you called out the high adoption rates of some of the other products over the course of the last year. Can you give some updates on what the current GP mix looks like for Cash App and how you see that evolving? Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question, Lisa. So, let me sort of step back and talk about the strong unit economics and the growth of the business model over time. I spoke a little bit earlier already to efficient acquisition driven through network effects for growing our customer base, while also growing the per customer engagement and monetization through strong retention within Cash App, retention at over 130% and ARPU, gross profit per customer growing 70% year-over-year to $41 in the fourth quarter. When you think about how we’ve been able to do that, it’s the growth and the breadth of the platform for Cash App with now four revenue streams driving more than a $100 million each approximately, $100 million to more than $100 million each in gross profit in 2020 versus only one back in 2019.
And that includes as you mentioned, some of the instant deposit Cash Card, Cash for Business and Bitcoin now. But we still think we’re in the early days as customers have used multiple products on the platform, they’ve generated 3 to 4 times greater gross profit historically. And this has led to our growing gross profit per customer and with so earlier here Cash Card has our strongest adoption to date and still remains at roughly one in four in terms of adoption from the mostly active base into the bottom of the active base and the monthly Cash Card usage. And Bitcoin is at about one in 10. So we see a real opportunity to drive adoption – further adoption into our existing base of products and with our existing base of customers and then layer on top of that, the opportunity to grow the customer base and grow the products over time.
One of the really interesting ways that I think Cash App has to drive that sort of differential product adoption is the Boost aspect of Cash Card. Boost has been an interesting lever for us. It’s been a powerful tool to drive engagement and adoption, not only with Cash Card, but also to graduate our customers to a broader ecosystem of products, so that we can diversify their experience, provide greater daily utility and ultimately build multiple revenue streams within our app.
Within – as you think about Boost as a tool within Cash Card, it’s differentiated and that it provides, it expands access really to instant rewards, no credit profile or fee required. And those rewards can be personalized to the customer in real time. And so it has been an acquisition tool for us, and it’s also been an engagement driver Boost active spend 2x more on their Cash Card than other cards active. But what we’ve started experimenting with in the fourth quarter is how Boost is a differentiated tool graduate customers’ to broader ecosystem of products.
In the fourth quarter as Bitcoin demand was growing, we launched a Bitcoin Boost where Cash Card customers could get rewards in Bitcoin. And what we saw there was that half the customers boosted were new to Bitcoin and nearly a third of those who are new to Bitcoin, went on to purchase their – make their first Bitcoin purchase in the following month. Similarly, we drove a Boost with paycheck deposits, where we launched a unique Boost for new direct deposit customers. And we’ve experimented Boost for a given time or merchants that will broadcast over social media. And so those have given awareness within the Cash App ecosystem of the broader product that, which I think is a key lever that we have moving forward and how we can influence product adoption and ultimately growth of multiple revenue streams within in Cash App. Terrific. Thank you. Your next question is some line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I wanted to touch on Credit Karma. Maybe you could give some added context around the e-tax filing opportunity for Cash App, whether it be retention, reactivation, new users and also how this could be something that we really should look for in Q4 for years to come. And then also a little bit more on the potential to turn some of these users into direct deposits, starting with your cash refund and then obviously, hopefully payroll down the road. Yes. We saw a pretty obvious opportunity in acquiring Credit Karma. As we’ve talked about on these calls, our roadmap consists of making sure that we’re focused on the most critical needs for our customers and accessing the economy and providing them really simple tools to empower them. Tax is obviously a big part of that and anything we can do to make it easier for people to manage and file their taxes is something we’re signing up for. More than 2 million individuals filed their taxes using Credit Karma tax last year. And a lot of these solutions are pretty complicated and time consuming. And as we’ve done with all of our products within Cash App and throughout the Seller ecosystem, we want to take a very strong point of view that they should be simple to work really hard to simplify them as much as we can.
And as to your other question, we think any of these critical solutions to problems people are having generally accessing the financial system will lead to using other products in our ecosystem. This is our whole strategy. People might come in because they received money from a friend using the peer-to-peer aspect, and then may discover the ability to buy stocks or buy Bitcoin, then discover that they can get a card and they can get their paycheck deposited to it and now they can file the taxes with it. So each one of these things, we believe positively reinforces the other. And we have people who are hiring us for to serve multiple jobs instead of being dependent and overly dependent upon just one, which would be a single point of failure for us. So we think there’s a lot of opportunity here and we’re starting with Cash App, there’s probably more we can do on the Seller side as well. But it’s a really strong start and one we’re pretty excited about. Great. Thanks a lot. That was bit of [indiscernible] it sounds like you kind of touched on, I was wondering if there was anything you could mention in terms of maybe there’s an opportunity to leverage the Credit Karma tax filing assets into the Seller ecosystems, but it sounds like maybe that’s down the road. Yes. That’s the other benefit of our ecosystem charging. And the fact that we have two, that a lot of what we build for Cash App might be able to find this way easily into Seller and vice versa. And we’ve demonstrated that in the past. So we expect a lot more of those internal efficiencies and eventual future sharing as time goes on. Great. Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. So you disclosed Cash App users at $36 million, up 60% year-over-year. Now as you look your user base today and do competitive benchmarking, how much overlap do you see between Cash App users and users of other platform? And also how does the customer acquisition and engagement in Cash App different versus your competitors? Thank you. Yes. So I – back to the previous answer, like I think our greatest strength, both in Cash App and Seller is the fact that we are creating ecosystem of tools and solutions for people. We’re not focused on just being peer-to-peer or just being a stock investment, or just being Bitcoin purchase, but finding the simplest and easiest and most accessible path for each, we believe is going to be the strongest approach. And of course, there’s probably some overlap in many of those, but our thesis and what we’re driving towards is when you find everything in one place and it’s super easy, and you can do things because of the connections that you can’t do on other platforms, because they’re all in one app, they’re all in one service that ultimately is the winning service and the winning pick.
So we imagine there’s a lot we can do, and we’ve shown this – we’ve shown some of these things like the Boost program that tie to direct deposit that other services just aren’t able to do. So in terms of acquisition, we don’t have to be focused on just one thing, we need to show that like, someone coming in for peer-to-peer, it’s the easiest way to send money ever. And once they come in for that that it’s very simple for them to discover everything else that we offer. So we’re really looking internally and inward at how we make all of these features more accessible and bring them to the surface for people so that they can activate them right away and start using them and not have to go to multiple apps to do the things they want to do every single day. And the same is true, as I said for Cash App, but the same is true for the Seller business as well. Thank you very much. Your next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KBCM. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on Boost. It certainly seems like it’s expanded beyond a rewards program and you’re finding lots of other use cases to drive new product adoption. The other thing that seems to be happening is you’re acquiring a lot of scale with respect to, and they use with respect to spending pattern, spending category. So I’m curious, have you had or progressed much on the advertiser discussions in terms of maybe wanting to help fund some of those rewards? Or should we really think about it as it’s really in a heavy engagement in multi-product adoption phase and monetization perhaps via advertising contribution is something that’s further down the road. Hey, Josh. Yes, you’re pointing to – sorry, Amrita. You’re pointing to the potential, but our focus right now is, we think there’s a lot of experiments that we can run that will indicate like, the ultimate directions that we should go with the Boost program. I’m really excited about the location aspect. Being able to understand where someone is and specifically like what local sellers around them and offer them a reward that they’re actually going to value and actually going to use and do so instantly is a really, really powerful idea.
And we can expand that even more by opening up down the line, but this is another area where it shows the strength of having these two ecosystems, both on the seller side and also on the individual side. But we're still in the phase of making sure that we're building a product that people value that is extremely easy. You don't even have to think about it in order to use it and continuing to looking for opportunities to broaden it. But right now focus on making sure all the capabilities and the attributes are there and it's just getting stronger and stronger every day. And I would just add Josh that we have the ability to be dynamic and how we should spend with respect to boost the way we built the program is a flexible dynamic and potentially personalized program. And so we've been able to manage our costs here in returns more efficiently, and frankly, on a week-by-week basis. About less than 5% of cash card transactions were boosted in the fourth quarter. So we sort of see boosters is punching above its weight, frankly in terms of its ability to impact the broader ecosystem given the relatively only one in 20 transactions are actually boosted. It really shows cash cards utility extend beyond boost.
And of course we're working on expanding our merchant relationships. We've seen boosts ability to drive a lift and acquisition at a compelling and low customer acquisition costs for various partners. So we'll continue to be working with them. On cash cards spend more broadly, we've seen average spend per customer increase in the first fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis with continued mix of spending very diverse across food, grocery, gas, utilities, retail during COVID. So there are multiple ways that we can use the card program coupled with the boost program to drive unique returns to our customers and increasingly potential for merchants as well. Okay. It sounds like lots of levers there. So appreciate the context from both of you. Have a great day. Thanks. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Thank you. And thanks for taking my question. So Jack, in the past you talked about kind of the Holy Grail being connecting to two ecosystems, and you came up with the cash-by Cash App [indiscernible] recently. And we think this is maybe an attempt to think about how to connect to ecosystems and then down the road, maybe even offer like an alternative checkout thinking. Talk about kind of the long-term strategic... The team did an amazing job with the cash-by Cash App. So we wanted to cash is definitely rich culture and we want to make sure that we're emphasizing that as much as we can. We have a really cool customer base and they love the Cash App and we wanted to ensure that people could express that in various ways, and that's why we relaunched the apparel line, but it also gave us an opportunity to demonstrate both the power of having something like Square online store in our company and also what it means to be able to pay with the Cash App directly.
And this is obviously early but you can imagine where it might go. As we make it even faster, we make it even easier. And I think it draws both on the Cash App ecosystem and as acquisition opportunities there and also for the seller ecosystem. As we've talked about on this call, I think there's a lot of opportunities between the two ecosystems and we are going to explore the most important ones. We've done a lot of internal connections between the two ecosystems and now we're focused on more of the customer facing thing connections. And the solo business have an opportunity to strengthen each other, and... Thanks again. Amazing results. Appreciate it. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of George Mihalos [Cowen and Co.] Congrats on very strong results again. Just wanted to ask the strength that you're seeing in the mid-market sellers, how vertical specific is that? Or is it sort of broad based? I know you have a number of very vertical specific solutions out there that are designed to resonate with somewhat larger merchants and it also the 40% of sales coming in from your salesforce efforts. What was that number maybe year ago? Thank you. Yes, maybe I can start a thought here. Thanks for the question, George. What we're seeing with mid-market sellers is fairly broad-based strengths particularly during COVID, if we think about the pairing of strengths in our omni-channel efforts, as well as strength moving up market we've been able to progress in our ability to serve restaurants. You can think about just even more recently, the couple of products that we've launched, where that helps many restaurants adapt quickly in the changing environment, kitchen display system, on demand and Seller power delivery – hope sellers adapt, restaurants adapt and help us a lot going up market with restaurants.
When we think about verticals that have found success relative speaking success in this environment, we have seen the strongest year-over-year growth in verticals like health and fitness, home and repair, and retail verticals in the fourth quarter as well as those verticals have helped – have continued to find ways to adapt in this challenging environment. And as we think about the sales team, again looking given the – 40% sort of engagement of our mid-market sales coming via the sales team has grown over time. As we've enabled greater efficiency for our sales team through AI and ML technologies.
And as mid-market seller has taken on more products on our ecosystem. We see, as I mentioned earlier, mid-market sellers taking on 2.5 products on average in our ecosystem. And we think given the variety of the breadth of products that we provide across hardware, software, payments, and financial services, that there's an even greater opportunity to offer those additional products to larger sellers over time to be able to meet their more complex needs. Thank you for the color. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC. Thanks, good evening. And there's a lot to digest here. So I appreciate all the information. The question I have is maybe for Amrita, can you just talk a little bit about the cadence of this investment, that you guys have outlined to understanding you highlighted $110 million or so in the first quarter kind of suggest that maybe it's a little more back in load and I just feel like given all this opportunity, that is facing the company, it might be bigger.
And then I think if I'm not mistaken, you also took up behind that range, maybe $50 million. So I'm just wondering what was the incremental opportunity that you saw that you wanted to see decline. Thank you. Sure. Yes. So the overall investment step up that we envisioned for 2021 is $800 million and $900 million, previously we had said $800 million to $850 million. This is really just about completing our annual plan process or budgeting process and seeing opportunities to lean in given the strong with folks we've driven from a cohort economic and payback in our life perspective that we were talking about earlier. So we see this as really just a refinement of the earlier numbers we shared with you and a reflection of the opportunity ahead.
In terms of how those investments spread across the business and then how they spread across the year, as you think about the ecosystems, we plan to invest directly about 60% of that step up into Cash App and 40% into Seller. And in terms of areas of spend about half of the step up going into sales and marketing, and about a quarter each in the product development and G&A as we build upon the foundation and expand our product breadth.
In terms of timing as mentioned, Q1 is an important quarter for us to lean into investments from a sales and marketing perspective, especially as you think about the Seller ecosystem, where many sellers are thinking about, who they're going to hire for their various needs coming out of the holiday period. And so that is an area that we want to invest, but if you think about the broader $800 million to $900 million, of course, there's a component that – progression that you see as well from quarter-to-quarter. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. And our last question is from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Hey, thanks. Just a two-parter on Bitcoin. First off the revenue there, I think it was only up around 7% or 8% quarter-over-quarter, even though obviously the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed and obviously been a lot of retail trading. So I was curious if there were any don't worry call outs there. And then just wanted to get your guys' perspective on pros and cons of Bitcoin versus the types of central banks in the world. Thank you. And in terms of Bitcoin quarter-over-quarter growth, we've continued to see strong adoption with 3 million customers across Bitcoin throughout the year for Cash App and in January, so 1 million new to Bitcoin in the month. So increasing awareness that, that building through time, and I think you'll see that reflected in the results as well with Bitcoin gross profit, which is how we sort of anchor to the economic impact to our business Bitcoin gross profit growing meaningfully on a year-over-year basis and also on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
And as we think about the opportunity year-over-year basis in Cash App and continues to be a strong front door for us as you see product adoption increasing for customers in their first be here, but you're right, it's still early days, only about 1 in 10 customers on Cash App are using the Bitcoin product and we see an opportunity to grow that over time. Yes, our thesis around Bitcoin is really quite simple. We believe the internet. We'll have a native currency. The internet has broken through so many barriers all around the world for every industry. And we do think money and currency are a big part of that future. And it doesn't take a lot to imagine, but certainly, that will exist and that it will be Bitcoin. And the reason why is it is completely open. It is driven by consensus. It is something that anyone can see and no particular third-party can actually control.
And that really speaks to the principles of the internet. And as more people participate, not only in investments, but also through products and through development, it gets even more trusted and more solid and more secure and something that more people can utilize. And that's our goal is to help people understand what Bitcoin is, what it can be used for it and make it a whole lot more useful and accessible for anything that they want to do on the internet. All right. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone for joining our call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants. We would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of April. These represent our current estimate for April performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of April, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual April results may differ from these estimates. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason. Thank you all for joining us. We continue to focus on helping our customers through COVID-19 as many states in the US and countries we serve reopen. With that focus in mind, this quarter, we again participated in the Paycheck Protection Program, enabling us to facilitate more than $1.4 billion in loans to date, $531 million in the first quarter to small businesses across the US, the vast majority of which were sellers with less than five employees.
Square Financial Services, our newly opened bank, will eventually allow us to expand access to banking services to many more small businesses. We also made government disbursements available to individuals through Cash App, enabling access to these funds up to two days early. We saw customer spending across the platform on critical needs such as rent, car payments, food and utility bills.
Now a few updates on our business before I turn to Amrita and your questions. We launched Square Messages this quarter, a new feature in our seller ecosystem that will efficiently connect sellers with their buyers through text or email. Square Messages is accessible from seller's online Square dashboard and consolidates communications with buyers from Square Feedback, Square Receipts and Square Appointments in one place. Now buyers can simply text or e-mail to sellers regarding their latest purchases or upcoming appointments, and sellers can respond while keeping their attention on the business.
Consumers and sellers have both expressed interest in being able to message each other directly and we believe this will help deepen the relationship and ultimately grow sales. Our omnichannel offers have enabled us to attract and retain larger sellers, too. Larger sellers come to Square for the breadth of our ecosystem, including our vertical point-of-sale products. Sellers who use Square for Restaurants or Square for Retail have adopted more than three of our products, on average, and generated greater than 5x to gross profit compared to the average seller in the first quarter.
Within Cash App this quarter, we launched Bitcoin peer-to-peer functionality. Customers can now send Bitcoin to friends and family for free within the app, which has attracted new customers to Bitcoin. This gives even more opportunities to build new network effects across the entire cash ecosystem. We've also found purposeful opportunities to connect seller and cash. This quarter, we incorporated Square Loyalty in the Cash App to drive customer discovery, engagement and retention, while also deepening the connection between buyers and sellers.
The integration allows for a richer customer experience with Square buyers to view and manage rewards using Cash App that enables cash up to reach and engage tens of millions of buyers using Square loyalty. These sorts of integrations are only possible because we have scaled ecosystems for both sellers and individuals, and we're excited about the opportunity for future connections.
Lastly, we closed the transaction to acquire a majority ownership stake in title and JZ has joined Square's Board of Directors. We believe there's a compelling intersection between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers. We're going to start small and focus on the most critical needs of artists in growing their fan bases. We're really enthusiastic to finally be able to start this work.
And with that, over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover today. First, a look at our performance in this first quarter of 2021; second, an update on our business through April and how we're thinking about growth comparisons going forward; third, I'll look at our investment approach for the rest of 2021, given our strong start to the year.
In the first quarter, our ecosystems delivered impressive growth, as gross profit was $964 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. Net income was $39 million and adjusted EBITDA was $236 million. Each of our Seller and Cash App ecosystems exhibited strengths in the quarter.
Seller generated gross profit of $468 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year. We saw relatively stable gross profit growth in January and February before trends improved in March behind regional reopenings, government disbursements and lapping of the early pandemic last year.
A few factors driving sellers' strong performance. First, we continue to make meaningful progress with mid-market sellers, which now account for 30% of our seller GPV mix, up four points from a year ago. In the first quarter, mid-market Seller GPV grew 43% year-over-year, more than twice the growth of total Seller GPV. We experienced a notable recovery in GPV from existing seller cohorts and GPV growth also benefited from strong acquisition of larger sellers during the pandemic.
Second, our markets outside the US delivered strong growth, with gross profit up nearly 80% year-over-year in the first quarter and with our largest market, Australia, doubling year-over-year. We see an opportunity to drive greater scale as we launch more of our software and financial services offerings globally and expand to new markets. Third, volumes from our online channels remained strong with up more than 50% year-over-year even as card present volume returned to positive growth. Cash App generated gross profit of $495 million, up 171% year-over-year.
Looking at some of the drivers. First, we saw increased engagement across our ecosystem with customers transacting more on each Cash App product year-over-year. Monthly actives in the first quarter transacted an average of 18 times per month across the ecosystem, with March reaching an all-time high for transactions per customer.
Cash Card is a strong example of a product that has driven engagement, both for spend on the card itself, as well as in the broader ecosystem. We reached more than 10 million monthly actives in March of which 7 million transacted in a given week on average. Cash Card has also been an entry point into other products on our platform as Card Act has adopted nearly twice the number of products as non-card active in the first quarter.
Second, we wanted to touch on the importance of inflows or the amount of money pulled into Cash App. We facilitate inflows in a variety of ways and they have been a primary driver of Cash App gross profit. Ultimately, inflows are correlated to consumer spending power. When the spending power of our customers increases, they have pulled more funds into Cash App to use across our ecosystem. We saw this in March, when inflows in the Cash App increased 55% month-over-month. Cash App's top priority this year is strengthening its foundation, making it easier for customers to bring funds into the ecosystem.
Moving to first quarter profitability. Adjusted EBITDA of $236 million was primarily driven by strong topline growth late in the quarter for both Seller and Cash App as well as the $29 million release of existing transaction loss provisions related to our solar business in the fourth quarter of 2020, as we've seen loss rates come in more favorably than expected.
Next, we wanted to share with you trends for both ecosystems in April. We expect gross profit for our Seller ecosystem to grow by more than 135% year-over-year and Cash App by approximately 130% year-over-year in April. We expect year-over-year gross profit growth rate to moderate from April through the remainder of the second quarter, as growth comparisons get tougher in May and June.
Given the variability in monthly trends on a year-over-year basis, we suggest using two-year compound annual growth rates or CAGRs from 2019 to 2021 to better reflect underlying growth trends. For Seller, we've seen a more consistent growth rate on a two-year basis as Seller's gross profit CAGR was more than 25% in April, which was a slight improvement compared to the first quarter.
For Cash App, the two-year gross profit CAGR was down slightly from 142% in the first quarter to approximately 130% in April. We believe our customers had greater spending power from government funds, which drove an uplift in inflows in March and we have since seen a normalization with inflows down 16% in April compared to March. During these periods of elevated inflows, customers have found greater utility in our ecosystem and adopted more products, which we believe will ultimately drive more inflows into Cash App longer term.
Turning lastly to where we're focusing our investments in 2021. On the back of our strong momentum, profitability and encouraging early returns on investment, we intend on increasing our investments to grow our business during the remainder of 2021. We now expect to invest $1 billion to $1.1 billion in non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss in 2021, which is an increase of $200 million compared with the prior range and represents growth of 50% year-over-year at the midpoint. We intend on distributing this investment across our Seller and Cash App ecosystems as well as title, which is not included in our prior guidance.
In summary, with a strong start to 2021, we remain focused on disciplined investing to drive long-term growth. We see meaningful opportunities to continue expanding reach of our ecosystems and reaching new customers around the world.
I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q& A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Hi, thanks you so much for the impressive acceleration here. I wanted to ask if there's a way to maybe unpack that acceleration. I know reopenings probably played a role, stimulus probably played a role and maybe you're seeing some early returns on your stepped-up investments, Amrita, like you just mentioned there. So is it possible to maybe unpack it that way? And I think it might help us think about the go forward as well. Thanks. Sure. Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. Taking a step back, both ecosystems are benefiting from strong tailwinds, coming out of the pandemic between reopenings, stimulus, secular shifts and from our own stepped-up investments. If you unpack it between sort of the three levers that you called out, reopening, government fund stimulus and our investments, you see all three playing out in the growth rates in Q1 and in April.
With reopenings, I think you can see that most clearly in the seller retention figures that we called out. We've been really encouraged here with the improvements that we've seen in recent months. When you look at GPV retention, existing cohorts of sellers have rebounded to around pre-pandemic levels. We're looking at that sort of two-year retention trend to normalize for the impact of COVID looking from '19 to '21. And in March and April of this year, GPV from our existing cohorts was nearly back to their 2019 levels.
Remember, this is a notable improvement from last year when the world was sort of discombobulated and our GPV retention was down about 40%. It improved to down 10% in the back half of last year, and we're now seeing back to very close to where they were in 2019, and on a gross profit basis, actually seeing positive retention for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019.
So what we're seeing there, again, is very much due to both, strength in reopenings as well as strength in the new cohorts that we're bringing on. Our most recent cohorts from 2019 and 2018 are showing better retention compared to older cohorts, we think, partly attributable to the greater mix of larger and more omnichannel sellers.
And in fact, to your point about investments in Q1, our newly acquired 2020 cohorts continue to show strong gross profit contributions, pacing ahead of prior cohorts on a dollar basis, contributing the most gross profit of -- among any annual cohort in Q1. We think that's a strong early indicator for healthy retention in this cohort.
From a stimulus perspective, you can certainly see that play out with respect to the inflows dynamic that we talked about in Cash App, where we saw 55% inflows step up month-over-month from February to March. With a smaller step-down in April, 16% step-down, still at an elevated level, but beginning to normalize as we see those stimulus funds run through our customers' account.
And then from an investment perspective, again, some of the investments that we've made into our business, we see playing out now in Q1, where in our Seller business, our new cohort of customers in Q1 plus strong growth on a year-over-year basis, trending to the similar payback we've seen historically in last year around five quarters.
And with Cash App, the investments that we're making here are a combination of bringing customers in as well as engaging our current customers. And those engagement trends, as we called out earlier are very strong within the Cash App ecosystem, our strongest level of transactions per month at 18 times per customer in the quarter, up 40% on a per customer basis, is really an indication of the investments that we make to make our customers aware of the broader product ecosystem. And it's because of these early returns that we want to continue to lean in on the investments throughout the remainder of the year. Got it. Good stuff. Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Good afternoon. So this quarter, you highlighted the integration of Square Loyalty into Cash App, which is one of the first explicit connections between the two ecosystems, I think, you've made. Can you just talk a bit about what other types of integration you're looking at making between the two ecosystems and sort of how you're thinking about the goals there, meaning focused on user growth, engagement growth, more monetization, improving underlying funding mix? Any additional color there would be helpful. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question. So, we think one of our superpowers is the fact that not only do we have an ecosystem on the Seller side that serves multiple verticals at once, but we also have the buyer side in Cash App. And our goal over time is to realize more of these connections. There's a lot of connections that you probably don't hear of, which are all internal. So everything that we build on the seller side, we can utilize internally on the Cash App side and vice versa. And that's allowed us to move much faster with both ecosystems because fundamentally, we have shared infrastructure.
So we have the external side, and we also have the external customer-facing connections, loyalty -- Square Loyalty and Cash App is a great example of that. We -- as you look at our ecosystem, as you look at how Cash Card is used, as you look at Boost, you can imagine many other connections around that. We think Square Loyalty and Cash App is a really big one because we have so many customers visiting Square Sellers, utilizing the loyalty programs and then integrating them into the Cash App and making sure that people understand that we have Cash App to offer. This allows us to build on those network effects that we develop in Cash App itself.
So ultimately, we're looking for the right connections that make sense from a customer perspective. And as we see more and more Cash Card uses at Square Sellers and we want to drive more, we have a lot of that control. And just have to make decisions around it as we learn what's best and what's most critical. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities here. There's a ton.
And as we add a new ecosystem in title, you can imagine even more, you can imagine even more connections between all three ecosystems because what makes that acquisition so compelling for us. So, this is a big part of our thesis around building these ecosystems in the first place. We'd be good with just one, but having multiple that can actually interconnect all under the same purpose is quite powerful and I think very, very unique. Terrific. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from Kamala Allison, owner of Fybr Bamboo. Hi. Thanks for having me. I'm Kamala Allison, owner of Fybr in Santa Cruz, California. We use a number of Square products to help run our brick-and-mortar and online shops. And my question is, as a small mom-and-pop retailer, my business has benefited greatly from a variety of Square solutions, including Square Register and Square Online. And as Square continues to position itself as a champion for small businesses, I'm wondering what the company's vision is for helping businesses like mine move up market and compete against larger retailers? Yes. Great question and thank you for trusting us and using us. This is exactly the reason we started. We found so many small sellers, micro-sellers, people who are considering opening a business in the first place. What they lacked were simple tools. We started with the simplest tool, is just enabling people to accept credit cards in the first place, which 12 years ago was not easy as a small business. And as [Indiscernible] more and more plastic, it became really critical not just to accept credit cards, but actually to not miss a sale.
So our goal here is to build a system that scales with the business. We don't want to be upper bounds on your business. And I think one of the proof points in this is we do have larger sellers. We do have larger retailers using Square. And a lot of those have actually grown with us. They didn't start large. They've grown as they've used us and as we've learned from them on how to make the tools better. So there's everything that we do in our tools is meant to scale to whatever your ambition is. And some, it's smaller, some might be much larger multi-location, multi-country, we can handle all of that.
Square Capital is a big part of this. We look deeply at what a small business needs, and we didn't give them too much and certainly didn't give them less than what they needed and doing a transparent and fair way was really important and making it easier, especially during last year when PPP came out. We have more than 80,000 sellers access $1.4 billion in PPP funding.
So every tool we make is designed in order to help a Seller make more sales and compete on a level playing field. And wherever you feel we're missing or we have a gap, please let us know and we'll move to very fast. But we're definitely here for businesses like yours and helping you grow if that's your ambition. Awesome. Well, I appreciate everything you're doing. Thank you. Thank you. And your next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Thanks guy. Great job through all this. But if we just look into the Seller growth, especially as we bring [Indiscernible] Cash App has been a big driver of last year, it looks like Seller just on easier comps. But more importantly, the underlying growth trends we're seeing in some of your newer or more growthier areas picking up steam like international. And then, when we look even beyond international at e-com and omni and what that could be for you guys going forward beyond pandemic. Can you just touch on the trends you're seeing in both those areas? And then how those into the growth profile of this business, maybe even later this year and into next year and beyond? Amrita, you want to go ahead. Yes. Hi Darrin thanks for the question. So I’ll lead off here with a couple of key points that can help orient you on how we're doing and what we're seeing so far and some of the key drivers of growth that you called out between international, omnichannel and e-commerce and growth with some of the mid-market sellers where we're seeing real traction.
With international, some of what we're seeing, particularly in the past few months and through the first quarter, is really encouraging. And that's coming on the back of closing the product parity gap that we've had between those international markets and the US And what that's leading to now is outsized growth with gross profit in the first quarter up nearly 80% year-over-year, now about 8% in seller gross profit in total.
Even with the pace of periodic lockdowns in certain markets in Q1, that growth was driven by continued mix of the acquisition of mid-market sellers as well as broader recovery and in-person activity towards the end of the quarter with reopenings, and we've seen that continue into April and again, some of the key markets that we see there between Australia and UK, in particular, where we've seen really strong growth as well as stepped-up investments. And we're now seeing the investments that we make in go-to-market in these international markets trending relatively in line with the payback, the very efficient payback that we see in the US now.
I think a lot of that again comes back to having a greater product set and greater product parity in the international markets now more than ever, and we'll continue to scale those across software, the financial services offerings and our sales and marketing spend. That's why we want to lean in.
From an omnichannel perspective as well, we've continued to see growth even with the return to positive growth on card-present volumes in the first quarter. We continue to see these omnichannel volumes, the online volumes and card-not-present with online volume growth at over 50% again in the first quarter, consistent with the average growth over the past couple of years. We see the increased importance here of our ability to address -- enable our Sellers to address their buyers through multiple channels.
And then from a mid-market perspective, we're also continuing to see this traction that we think will continue to be a source of growth for us. In this quarter, the growth from that 30% of our Seller GPV that comes from mid-market, those sellers were growing at more than 2x the rate of the overall Seller business. They grew 43% in the first quarter. And that's why we want to continue to lean in across the investments we're making in product, where that's where you see the vertical software and the developer platform really address the more complex needs that larger sellers have, as well as the investments we're making in marketing and sales. Intention is to double the sales team this year to increase our outbound outreach to reach even more larger sellers and to continue our investments in marketing across awareness, marketing and product-specific campaigns that we know are targeted to larger sellers. That's really helpful. Just good to see the runway you guys have. Thanks again. Thanks, Darrin. Our next question is from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Thanks a lot. I'd like to dig into the Cash App inflows topic. You were talking about that a little bit during the prepared remarks. Specifically payroll direct deposit, clearly one of the more important drivers there. Maybe you could talk about some of the tactics you've been taking to increase that penetration, but of course it going beyond that. There are many other ways to drive inflows, whether it be debit cards, bank transfer, peer-to-peer trading, maybe you could talk a little bit about those as well and how they're helping to drive those inflows. Yes. I'll kick us off. So direct deposit remains a top priority for the Cash App team this year, and we've seen pretty meaningful traction from deposits to impact tax refund season. So a lot of our work recently has been making direct deposit much more visible and the experience more frictionless as we on it so we can help with those inflows.
One of our top priorities in 2021 is making sure our foundation can serve all the use cases in the ecosystem. So we're investing a lot in the infrastructure, automation support, compliance to allow greater funds into our ecosystem. This is a really big one and allowing customers money into Cash App in new ways. Several funding methods with Cash App does an offer to customers today, and we're going to continue to evaluate. Credit Karma was also a big mix in this as we get to focus on those inflows from a tax perspective as well. And let me just add a couple of… [indiscernible] on the Credit Karma point. A quick follow-up which is very related to this. Given the strengthening… Our next question is from Pete Christiansen from Citi. Thank you. Good evening. Nice acceleration. Jack, I'm hoping we could dig a little bit more into Square's investment rationale for acquiring title. How should investors think about, I guess, synergy realization with the brand? And how do you envision what the early integration efforts might look like with Square's existing ecosystems? Thank you. Yes, great question. And I know a bunch of you out there had questions around this. We're super excited about this work because we get to broaden how we build our tools for an entirely new set of audience, and that said, is artists and musicians. If you look at the space, obviously, there's a ton of competition in streaming but there's not a really great effort around artist tools. And what -- the thesis we had going into this deal was that we want to make sure that like everything that we learn from helping a seller with very simple tools in order to participate in the economy, we can bring to an artist because we saw a ton of parallels between what a new emerging artist has to go through, the long tail of artists and what a small business has to go through. They're very similar.
And we're going to start with the most critical needs, and we have a good 100-day road map and you all should be seeing some updates within those 100 days. We're going to focus on those simple critical artist tools in a way that we know and really provide a platform for artists to turn to first when they want to release their work. And we are focused on a more emergent. We are focused on a more long tail because that is the pattern and the flow that has worked for us with the seller base.
But as you see in our business, we have handled some of the largest sellers in the world, and we expect to be able to provide the same sort of tools and experiences for the largest artists in the world as well. And fortunately, we have some of the largest artists in the world within this deal and also on our Board, who have been through the entire industry, understands what an artist needs, understand what the new emergent artists needs and how to really build a service that they love and really is giving back to them and to their career. So that was the thesis behind the deal. We're going to move super fast and we're really excited about doing the work. And I imagine with some of the releases that we will be putting out over the next year, that you will see the same parallels that we see. Thank you. And we have a question from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yes, I was just -- it was a quick follow-up there. So Jack, you were mentioning about the progress in payroll direct deposit and all the many other ways to have inflows come into the Cash App ecosystem. The brief follow-up was just that, is it fair to assume that, given all of the strength in those inflows that the Cash App marketing spend for this year could be a little bit more heavily skewed towards discretionary or what we call offensive customer acquisition spend relative to the nondiscretionary funding and some of the other portions of the cost? Hey, Tim, just to pick up on your question since I know it kind of got cut off before. I wanted to also lean in on your prior question, which was around direct deposit and putting that in context of inflows. With direct deposit, we've seen encouraging recent progress, as Jack was speaking through, with March being our highest number of overall drug deposit actives and our first-time actives was growth driven by government fund inflows, paycheck deposits and tax refunds.
Although we do believe that they're still very early in this ramp, and we've clearly benefited from government disbursements in the month of March. As you noted, it does give us an opportunity as we see these higher inflows, whether they're from direct deposit customers or from other inflow sources, which by the way, were much higher, six times higher than direct deposit sources in the month of March.
As we see those elevated levels of inflows and as we see more engaged customers, we generally see higher product adoption, engagement and lifetime value. And that then unlocks the opportunity for us to invest in the business in more deliberate ways, to the second part of your question. And so we do see an opportunity here to continue to, to lean into the growth and step up that we see in the Cash App business overall.
But I do want to just make sure that we clarify in inflows, is there multiple ways to inflow money into Cash App, right? You have peer-to-peer transfer. You have cash from your bank account added automatically or one-time at a time or through direct deposit. And it's through the broader growth of inflows that we see an opportunity to continue to invest and see higher ARPUs over time. Great. Well, thank you so much for taking that and the follow-up. And thank you for looking me back in. And our next question is from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about crypto. You've been involved in Bitcoin from very early on. We are now seeing -- they are suggesting a majority of millennials and now interested crypto, significantly more versus a year ago. Are you looking to expand into crypto beyond, it's going buy and sell? And on a somewhat related note, what do you also think about CBBCs and squares potential goal to play there? Thank you. Yes. So, just a reminder on some context on why decline and why we believe this is the right path for us. We see Bitcoin as the Internet's potential to have a native currency. And we want to further that as much as we can. And a lot of our work really lines up to that. We started with buying and selling of Bitcoin in Cash App, but what we've done since, including open source development via Square Crypto, COPA, which is open source foundation for crypto patents to protect the community.
And a lot of our related work around government lobbying as well or CTI, is all around making sure that can realize a native currency, because it is so fundamental to businesses on the Internet and so fundamental to our business generally. So our focus, first and foremost, is on enabling, and this is going to be a long-term focus, on enabling Bitcoin to be the net currency. It removes a bunch of friction for our business, and we believe fully that it creates more opportunities for economic empowerment around the world. And you should see more of activity from us over the year towards this goal. So we do think that Bitcoin is the important one to focus on, and it's what we are focused on. And I would add, Harshita, when you look at some of the product innovations that we have for our Cash App customers with respect to Bitcoin, there are things that we can uniquely do that we think really differentiates for us. It's the intersection of multiple products with each other, whether it was the Bitcoin Boost that you saw last quarter or it's now peer-to-peer Bitcoin, where you have the ability to – friends can send each other Bitcoin all through Cash App very seamlessly. These are things that Cash App can uniquely do to serve our customers. And we think that's part of the reason that we've been able to drive awareness more broadly with Bitcoin with our strongest acquisition of new Bitcoin actives in the first quarter and growth in volumes per customer, which we also saw in the first quarter, those are the compounding benefits that get us to the growth that we've seen here now with $75 million in gross profit in the first quarter, up 11x year-over-year. Okay. Thank you. Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Tidal. So understanding and appreciating that the tools for artists that you're working on, can you comment on plans or thinking around using Tidal to drive engagement for consumer users of the Cash App in like exclusive content or integration into Cash App. And I guess just kind of a bolt-on is what's your view on acquiring or developing other non-financial services assets to kind of deepen the consumer relationship? Is this just the first step in a new direction or is this kind of a one-off? Yes. So I forgot to mention in my answer just the – another big reason we looked at Tidal in the first place is because we see such an intersection between when our customer base in Cash App and general culture and music and what we find in Tidal, obviously. So we think there's a ton of connection points between Cash App and Tidal.
We're super excited to explore those. Hopefully, you'll see some of those manifest this year. We think – we do believe that we have an opportunity here to drive engagement around a lot of tools that you might find in our seller base and a lot of experience you would find in Cash App.
And you can imagine some of the more obvious ones that you see artists currently struggling with, but we can make it very, very easy. It's not just about streaming revenue. There's a lot to the broader ecosystem where artists get paid, inclusive of merchandise and ticketing and all these other things.
So there's a lot of potential. We just want to make sure that we're doing the most critical things first, and we want to make sure that we're known as the place for artists to create first and foremost, and then really pair that with an incredible listening experience and fan experience to bring the fans closer, and Cash App is in an incredible way for us to do that because of the surface area, and just the people that we're serving with the Cash App. So it made sense on so many dimensions to us internally. And we're excited to show off these connections as we go forward this year. Good. Thank you. And our next question is from Josh Beck with KBCM. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Seller business. It seems Square for Restaurants and Square for Retail maybe is inflecting. I know that about half of the new Sellers are adopting those products or half of them are new to Square. So are you seeing maybe like an accelerated displacement of legacy systems? Do you feel like you're perhaps getting better awareness for new business formation? Maybe just help us unpack a little bit the momentum that you seem to be having there. I think it's a bit of all those things that you mentioned. We're certainly displacing our agency systems because people want to upgrade. And we saw a lot of that in 2020 due to COVID, where the legacy systems would not allow for online sales.
And while you have a business who does the majority of their transactions off-line, last year, they were forced to go online. And we just made it super easy for them to do that. And as things reopen, go back and have a good mix now, now that they open their eyes towards what's possible with online.
We found in the past that a lot of sellers tend to be a little bit slow to adopt newer technologies because what they have is working. And we just want to take that fear away and make sure that they -- with a few button presses can get right into it and go, and we certainly benefited from that.
We've definitely seen businesses cross vertical as well. We've mentioned on this call before, but we see restaurants become retailers and retailers serve food, and we'll see more of that as more reopen services, service businesses become retailers as well and vice versa. So we -- because we cover all verticals, we can allow for that blending where the seller does not have to think about it at all. They can just focus on what they're trying to build and the customer base.
And then I would say like the fact that we do have a much broader ecosystem than most, we're not just a point-of-sale. We lend people money as well. We have CRM and loyalty built in. We have integrations to Cash App, and the more of those that we make easy, the less the seller has to do it themselves.
If you visit a large seller or a small seller, the amount of systems they have to hook together in order to just do their business is insane. So we take all that work. We put it into one website, one app, and people can just immediately focus on their customers internal attention to growing the business. And that's real. So taking all that friction away from folks so that they can focus on meaningful continues to be a competitive advantage for us. And Josh, what we are seeing here is rapid growth with the restaurant retail product. In Q1, annualized gross profit from the sellers who used those products was $140 million, which doubled on a year-over-year basis. Remember, in Q1, where we still had a portion of the quarter were many sellers were only partially able to be in business. But half of that came from these restaurant retail products and half, to Jack's point, came from other products across the ecosystem.
We know that these products attract sellers with more complex needs and we can serve them in other ways over time. But we still think it's early here, and that's why we want to scale these products further, and that's part of the reason we want to continue to invest in marketing and sales to increase the awareness about our capabilities here. That makes sense. Really nice momentum. Thank you, both. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the impressive growth of Cash App in April. Cash App gross profit, I think, was up 130% despite, if I remember correctly, it was a tough comp from last year that it picked up on. So, just trying to think about the growth rate of that business as we go forward and potentially Cash App gross profit per user as we go through 2021. Thanks much. Sure. Happy to help out. So you're right, with April, we saw strong growth both on a year-over-year basis and on a two-year CAGR basis, Cash App grew approximately 130% due to strong underlying trends, frankly, that we're seeing in our business, many of which we've talked about between engagement up approximately 40% year-over-year, with March reaching all-time highs in terms of transactions per customer as well as in terms of spending power. This comes back to close. This comes back to our customers' ability to bring money into Cash App and use it in the ways to benefit them, with growing utility on our platform.
We did see, obviously, an impact from government disbursements in March here, where we saw a significant increase in both our customer spending power and the inflows in the Cash App, where inflows were up 55% month-over-month in March and then moderated a bit in April with inflows down on a month-over-month basis, about 16%, but still at that elevated level in April as well as March.
When we look forward, we do know that our customers' spending power is going to continue to be influenced by things like the macro landscape as well as obviously, government fund programs. The current stimulus bill and most recent programs have different elements than the prior ones last year, so it may look different on a month-over-month basis than what we saw last year as an example.
The recent program has roughly half the amount of unemployment insurance benefits as last year. But we do have new elements to this program around the child tax credit and unemployment tax credit. So, we don't fully know what the impact of those elements will be to our customers' spending power and therefore, to our inflows, but we would expect to see some moderation, given the tougher comps, as you pointed out on a year-over-year basis.
Again, the pace and the magnitude of that normalization is going to depend on how our customers use their funds ultimately. And again, it's part of the reason that we're suggesting that you look at the two-year CAGRs going forward to normalize for some of that year-over-year changes as we go throughout the year.
And then, of course, longer term, what we're focused on with Cash App is being able to reach more customers and drive engagement, which ultimately, over time, we think drives inflows into the ecosystem. Great. Congrats on results. Thanks. The next question is from Rayna Kumar with Evercore ISI. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Over the last few months, you've added a number of new Boost rewards, particularly Bitcoin Boost. I'm curious to better understand how some of these new Boots rewards have had an impact on your engagement and gross profit per user. They're pretty incredible. So Boost just helped us reach new Cash Card customers and increase the utility of it. First, it's very rare for a card like that to have something not instantaneous, but more importantly, controllable. Anyone can go to the app and just choose whatever fits, whatever they're about to do.
So if you're about to go in a restaurant, you might see a Bitcoin Boost or 20% off. If you're in a bus getting a lift, you might see that Boost for the pet store to buy some dog food, you might see that. So it's -- we want to make it super, super flexible, and that's where I think the magic lies in it.
And various Boosts have different expirations and different aspects to them. So there's a discovery aspect to it as well, to see what is new and what new Boost comes up. And this all goes back to what we continue to build within the Cash App.
This is an increase to the Boost, Cash Card, investing, Bitcoin. All these things provide more network effects for us. So people may come in because they received a payment from their family member or their friends, they download the app.
They can see that we sell Bitcoin. They can buy Bitcoin. They can buy some of the Bitcoin for their friends who doesn't have the app yet, get it and then they see the - we have investing and so on and so forth.
So we want to build a suite of services that are relevant to the audience we're trying to serve and are also critical to them and do it in one place where they don't have to really go anywhere else, just like our Seller ecosystem. They don't have to look anything else up. They don't have to download any other apps.
They can do all the things that people want to do in this day, in this present moment from one app, and we'll continue to add more and more of those features. But Boost is -- we still consider it to be fairly early in terms of the capabilities that we're going to enable. And it has a pretty exciting runway ahead of it. Very helpful. Thank you. And your next question is from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Hey, great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. So can you guys talk a little bit about the new products that are coming out? I know that there's been a lending product that was in beta. Can we get a sense of sort of the timing for those and whether or not we should expect them? Thank you very much. I'm sorry. What was the first part of your... The lending product. Sorry, Jack [Indiscernible] The one with the -- with Cash App? Yeah, exactly. The payday lending, low APR product. Yes, yes, yes. So we have a lot of experience, obviously, in lending, and this is one of the benefits like everything that we do within Seller, we learn a lot from and we -- if it makes sense, we can translate it to Cash App. We do see a pretty incredible opportunity around lending to individuals. We are currently experimenting with that with a small group of customers and small amounts.
Again, like one of the things that worked for Square capital is, if sellers went to a bank, they would we offered a minimum of $25,000 or $20,000 and it's just not -- that's way too much. They needed $5,000 to buy a new salon chair. So we really focused on like the actual needs. And through that, we saw massive growth within Square Capital. And we're doing that – we have the same approach with lending in Cash App, like what are the actual needs and how is it best served within the Cash App. So through this beta, that's the question we're trying to answer. We started with a small nominal amount, and as we get feedback and as we understand payback rates and how it's working, we'll make further decisions and roll it out to more people. But right now, we're still running mode and as we get more of those, we'll make it more concrete and deliver to 100%. Got it. And Dan could maybe just answer the sort of higher-level question of road map for Cash App. I would also encourage you to think about what's unique about Cash App and what we feel really differentiates both of our ecosystems is the intersections of multiple products at once from a consumer standpoint. And it's those connections between various products that can sometimes drive differentiation, unique value and, in Cash App's case network effects. So the intersections of peer-to-peer with decline drive network effects for both. The intersection of boost with direct deposit drives awareness, and I think that those sorts of intersections are key areas for exploration for Cash App going forward, even independently of new product launches. And similarly, as Jack was speaking about earlier in the call, some of the foundational improvements that we're making the Cash App will enable us to reach broader demographics of customers going forward. So there are multiple growth vectors that can play out here that involve product improvements that may not be necessarily related to specific product launches. So those are, of course, in the works as well. Excellent. Thank you. Amazing stuff. And that's all the time we have today for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call in 2021, and we will see you on the next earning call. Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today's conference call.

Welcome to the Square Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Jason Lee, Head of Investor Relations. Jason? Hi, everyone. Apologies for the delay. We were just experiencing technical difficulties with the conference line. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call during which we will discuss Square's planned acquisition of Afterpay. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. Also joining us on the call is Nick Molnar, Co-CEO and Co-founder of Afterpay. We will begin this call with some remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. 
We would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC in the investor deck and press release about our planned acquisition on our IR website for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. 
During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of July. These represent our current estimate for July performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of July, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual July results may differ from these estimates. We may also discuss financial metrics for Afterpay, which are available in Afterpay's public filings. 
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. 
Finally, we are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary on the transaction. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and the call are available through the Investor Relations section on our website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly after the conclusion of the call.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. Thanks, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we discuss our plans to acquire Afterpay, which we announced yesterday, I'd like to first share 2 highlights from the quarter. Continuing our commitment to expand access to financial tools and services, in July, we launched Square Banking for our U.S. sellers. This new suite of products will help business owners better manage their cash flow and get more out of their money. Square Banking now includes 3 core products, 2 deposit accounts, Square savings and Square checking, joining Square's existing lending products now called Square Loans. By offering central banking tools that integrate seamlessly with seller solutions like payments and Square Payroll, sellers now have a unified view of their payments, balances, expenses and financing options. 
We also announced the launch of a new business at Square. Its name is CBD, which will focus on building an open developer platform with the goal of making it easy to create noncustodial, permissionless and decentralized financial services. Our primary focus is on Bitcoin, driven by our belief that Bitcoin has massive potential to level the playing field for all. We're going to make our development process completely transparent to the public. We plan to share updates publicly in real time as we have them. 
Now on to yesterday's acquisition announcement. Today is an important day for Square, for Afterpay and for what we can do together to better serve our customers. Through this transaction, we will be uniting 2 companies with a shared focus on economic empowerment and financial inclusion and taking the important opportunity to connect our 2 largest business units, Seller and Cash App. By integrating Afterpay into Seller and Cash App, we plan to combine complementary businesses while also accelerating even stronger connections and driving more commerce across both ecosystems.
Increasingly, we're seeing strong demand for Buy Now Pay Later for both merchants and consumers, and rapid adoption amongst both, especially among younger consumers. This new financial service gives more control to individuals and merchants and is one of -- and is one we want to make part of our combined ecosystem. It's a simple idea to enable our sellers customers to pay for purchases later interest free without having to use traditional credit sources while helping drive more omnichannel sales to the seller. 
Afterpay has built this out as a seller tool and combined that with a flexible, responsible payment method for consumers that also includes merchant discovery. As of June 30, Afterpay served more than 16 million consumers and nearly 100,000 merchants globally with huge opportunity for growth in both sides and growth in one helps the other, just like the rest of our ecosystem today.
Beyond the compatibility of our businesses, we've been drawn from the start to Afterpay's founder-led entrepreneurial team. Afterpay's Co-Founder and Co-CEOs, Nick and Ant, have built an authentic, thoughtful and visionary team focused on economic empowerment. It's been incredible to witness how effortlessly our conversations flowed around shared ideas and vision. 
Every conversation has raised the bar on what we can all do together, and our strong collaboration will well serve our integration process. I'm thrilled that upon closing, Nick and Ant will join Square and help lead Afterpay's respective merchant and consumer efforts as part of Square's Seller and Cash App teams, and I'm excited to see what we can build together.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Nick to tell you more about Afterpay. Thank you very much, Jack. Hi, everyone. It's an absolute pleasure to be here today back in the U.S. and just in time to come announce the next phase of our incredible journey. I'm here today because of my Co-Founder and Co-CEO, Anthony Eisen, who only a few years ago, sat down with me over some veggie mutton on toast around his kitchen table to discuss how we could improve the financial well-being of the next generation, to empower them to spend responsibly without having to revolve in debt, interest payments or service fees. I'm thankful every day that Ant and my past crossed in that way and our families have had the privilege to go on this journey together. 
It's been an incredible six-odd or so years since, ending our fiscal year 2021 nearly doubling our business year-on-year, building a loyal base of Afterpayers who love the product and a network of more than 100,000 merchants who see increased retail opportunity through our partnership and notwithstanding the recent challenges in the global economy. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved so far, and know that yesterday's announcement, there is so much more to come. 
We've been long admirers of the Square team and in many ways have lived parallel journeys as entrepreneurs focused on creating financial empowerment for consumers and businesses alike. As we've gotten to know each other better, the scale and shape of our businesses, the synergies in our products and our shared purpose, it's abundantly clear that we're at the start of an amazing partnership. And I know our team across the globe will share my excitement and enthusiasm of the opportunity to come. 
We started Afterpay having met by chance as neighbors in Sydney. Both Ant and I were passionate about developing an alternative to traditional finance and credit products. Having seen firsthand the impact of the global financial crisis and knowing that many millennial and Gen Z consumers were looking out for an alternative to traditional credit, we saw a way to empower consumers to responsibly buy what they wanted with their own money and to drive incremental value to merchants. 
Since then, Afterpay has become a leader in the global Buy Now Pay Later space. We have flipped the traditional credit model on its head to drive significant value to both merchants and consumers.
Our product and approach is simple to sign up within minutes, make your first purchase via in-store, online or app and repay in 4 equal installments. When you sign up to Afterpay, we don't conduct a credit check or ask you to jump through any hoops. Our model is based on trust. You start with a lower spending limit that increases over time and reflects good repayment behavior. 
Afterpay consumers share a deep loyalty and affinity with our product and brand. They are -- they have to pay their purchases frequently across many retailers and verticals. It's this frequency with which our consumers use Afterpay that truly differentiates us and shows the power of our products and platform. On average, our top 10% of consumers globally used Afterpay more than 30 times in the U.S. and 50 times in Australia in financial year 2021. 
And for merchants, whether they're large enterprise or small to medium-sized businesses, we truly partner to help grow their business. We have driven higher average order values, greater basket sizes and the additional new and repeat customers often who within 24 or 48 hours of going live. 
Above the value of our core payment proposition, in FY '21, Afterpay drove over 1 million leads on average per day and after the key marketing customer acquisition channel for our global retailers in attracting this highly valuable next-generation consumer. As Ant and I have gotten to know the Square team better, what's become clear is how aligned we are not just in our business, but the way we think, live and breathe our mission. In almost every conversation, we've been focused on creating a better way for people to spend, save and do business with the intent of building greater financial well-being. And the brilliant thing is that both of our companies share this commitment. By bringing together our platform with Square, we know we can leverage our combined strength to continue to connect both sides of the economic equation so that everyone shares in great outcomes.
As we look forward, there are a number of ways in which our businesses can achieve shared and even greater success. Our businesses are highly complementary across segments, products, channels and geographies. This combination will further expand our combined opportunity across small, medium and enterprise businesses, consumer banking and financial services, wider retail categories and both online and in-person commerce. Both Square and Afterpay resonates strongly with the millennials and Gen Z consumers, and we're excited at the opportunity for the Afterpay product to be offered to a growing base of more than 70 million annual active Cash App customers whose lifestyles, preferences and views are shared and very familiar with us.
These consumers will increase the reach for our retail partners and the marketing value we can drive to their businesses. Likewise, our merchant bases are very complementary to the millions of sellers that use Square to run and grow their businesses today. We believe we can introduce a number of upmarket and global sellers to the Square business. And as merchants and consumers increasingly look for seamless in-store and online experiences, I am confident that together we can really maximize the strength of our omnichannel offerings, complementary technology and expertise.
Yesterday's announcement marks the start of an incredible opportunity to unlock the next phase of growth in our business. The compelling transaction provides our shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the future growth of an innovative company aligned with our vision. 
Importantly, our Australian Afterpay shareholders will still be able to maintain exposure to the growth and value creation of the combined company through owning Square shares or CDIs. I know both Ant and I are incredibly excited to join the Square team upon completion of the transaction and help lead Afterpay's respective merchant and consumer efforts as part of the Square Seller and Cash App efforts.
Thank you to the Square team for picking up a conversation with 2 Aussie entrepreneurs and seeing the strength of our combined opportunity. I can't wait to see where we take this. And now over to Amrita. Thanks, Nick. We believe this is a transformative opportunity for our combined companies. And there are 3 topics I'd like to cover regarding the proposed Afterpay acquisition: First, the strength of the Afterpay business; second, the complementary aspects of our merchants and consumer ecosystems; and third, the propound growth opportunity we see together. 
Afterpay has distinguished itself as a category leader in Buy Now Pay Later with a product that is well positioned for secular shifts among merchants and consumers. First, greater consumer and merchant adoption has enabled Afterpay to deliver remarkable growth with revenue up approximately 4x over the last 2 years. We see a number of levers to help drive continued growth for Afterpay, first, in terms of ongoing secular growth of Buy Now Pay Later in e-commerce; and second, in terms of Afterpay's future growth adjacencies.
Second, Afterpay's business has strong cohort economics, providing a durable foundation for growth across its merchants and consumer base. Afterpay has delivered positive GMV retention and increased purchase frequency over time with strong paybacks and returns on acquisition spend. These fundamentals mirror the dynamics in our Cash App and Seller ecosystem around growing engagement and strong returns.
Next, we're excited by our compelling cross-sell opportunities. By integrating Afterpay directly into our Cash App and Seller ecosystem, we can expand each brand's customer base, strengthen each other's products and build connections. On the consumer side, the addition of Afterpay embeds commerce more directly into Cash App. Afterpay's merchant base will have access to 4x more consumers, and Cash App will have access to 16 million Afterpay consumers who represent a complementary demographic base. On the merchant side, we'll introduce Square Sellers to Afterpay's Buy Now Pay Later offering, which expands Afterpay more deeply in the new verticals and in-person commerce.
Turning to the financial impact from the deal. We're excited about the meaningful growth opportunity Afterpay will add.  With year-over-year gross profit growth of 96% in the last 12 months ended June 30, we expect Afterpay to be accretive to gross profit growth in the first year after closing. Afterpay is a younger business and earlier in ramping its profitability, so we expect a modest decrease to adjusted EBITDA margins in the first year after closing. Historically, our investments behind strong cohort economics have driven compounding profitable growth. We similarly intend to invest behind Afterpay's strong return to unlock the significant synergies we see ahead.
Under the terms of the agreement, Square will acquire Afterpay for approximately USD 29 billion where Afterpay shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.375 shares of Square Class A common stock for each ordinary share of Afterpay they own. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by shareholders of both companies. And of course, the stock-based consideration of this transaction not only strongly aligns management's incentives but also enables shareholders of both Square and Afterpay to participate in future upside opportunity.
We believe the combination of Square and Afterpay will benefit our customers in the long-term profitable growth of our company.
I'll now provide a brief overview of Square's financial results in the second quarter before we take your questions. In the second quarter, our ecosystems delivered gross profit of $1.14 billion, an increase of 91% year-over-year, which was our strongest quarterly gross profit growth as a public company. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate, or CAGR basis, which helps normalize for the impact of the pandemic on 2020 results, this was an increase of 57%, a slight improvement from the first quarter. Net income was $204 million and adjusted EBITDA was $360 million.
Taking a look at performance for each ecosystem. Cash App generated gross profit of $546 million, an increase of 94% year-over-year or 128% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Growth in the quarter benefited from Cash App growing and engaged base of customers. We ended the quarter with $40 million monthly transacting actives in June with nearly 2/3 of our monthly actives being weekly actives, an engagement figure we've seen increase over time. We also saw a significant increase in annualized gross profit per monthly actives, which was $55 in the second quarter, up 2.5x from 2 years ago and up 1/3 from 2 quarters ago, primarily driven by growth in inflows. 
Now to our Seller business, which generated gross profit of $585 million, an increase of 85% year-over-year or 30% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Even as we saw regional reopenings and a strong recovery in card-present volumes during the quarter, GPV from online channels has continued to remain strong, growing nearly 50% in the second quarter. We also continue to make progress driving growth with larger sellers. In the second quarter, mid-market GPV doubled from the same period in 2019, representing more than 1/3 of total seller GPV. 
Next, we wanted to share trends for both ecosystems in July. For Cash App, we expect gross profit growth of greater than 110% on a 2-year CAGR basis or approximately 20% year-over-year. Remember, July is our toughest year-over-year comp for Cash App this year. On a 2-year CAGR basis, we saw some moderation in Cash App growth from 128% in the first quarter, and this may continue to normalize in future quarters depending on how consumer spending power trends. And for Seller, we expect gross profit growth of more than 45% year-over-year and a 2-year CAGR of 29%, roughly in line with the 30% of the second quarter.
Seller GPV trends have continued to vary by region. Although the world has experienced rising COVID cases in certain regions, particularly outside of the U.S., we haven't seen this impact overall GPV trends materially through July.  We'll continue to track it real-time, and we recognize further regional restrictions could affect our business performance.
Finally, on to where we're focusing our investments in 2021 on the back of strong momentum in gross profit growth, profitability and encouraging trends on investment in -- returns on investment in the first half of 2021, we intend to increase our investments in the second half of the year. Across 2021, we now expect to invest an incremental $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss, which is growth of 55% year-over-year at the midpoint.
In summary, with the momentum we've seen in the first half of 2021, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, not only for Cash App and Seller ecosystems, but also the opportunities we have by integrating Afterpay across them. We believe together we can make more meaningful connections between our consumer and merchant ecosystems that ultimately serve our communities.
With that, I'll turn it over to questions. [Operator Instructions] Lisa, please open your line. Terrific. Can you hear me? Congratulations. There's a number of successful BNPL players globally, and Square also has historically built a lot of capabilities in-house. Can you just talk about what factors led you to decide that Afterpay specifically is the best fit for Square versus alternative BNPL players or doing organic investment? Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Lisa. So as you mentioned, I mean, this space is getting more and more crowded. And obviously, there's a lot of different services and solutions out there. We started with what Nick and Ant have built and how ambitious and entrepreneurial and innovative they've been that they were extremely early in this space, help define a lot of it and really raise the bar on what everyone else is doing. So we are impressed by the vision, by their ambition, probably the entrepreneurship.
I think the other big thing for us is making sure that -- we've talked on this call a lot about how to connect it to our 2 biggest ecosystems, Seller and Cash App. And this was a clear fit in a way that they built their model out, a simple marketing tool and some incredible discovery for consumers. So for consumers, Afterpay offers truly interest-free products that don't require any credit history, something vastly different from what we've seen with other Buy Now Pay Later products. And this allows broader access to consumers while helping them spend a lot more responsibly. So that goes towards our purpose of economic impairment.
And for merchants, Square has always asked the question, how can we help our merchants make more sales. And that was exactly the question that Afterpay has been asking, providing them a way to generate leads through the Afterpay app, which has helped them improve conversion rates, increase their transaction sizes and led to repeat purchases and repeat customers. So this allowed Afterpay to reach more than 16 million consumers and 100,000 merchants globally.
So we're -- looking at the deal, this was an obvious connection between the Seller and Cash App Ant and Nick have built on top of an ecosystem model. There's a clear fit into our model that makes it even stronger for us. And the team they built is incredible, creative innovative and ambitious. And we just saw this as a perfect move for both companies. And Lisa, I'd add to that as well. We've been really impressed with the strong business fundamentals that Afterpay has demonstrated. Of course, we look at the combination of both growth and cohort economics. And what we see here in the cohort economics is growing engagement amongst consumers. After onboarding, customers transact more frequently each year that they're on the platform with some of the older cohorts from Australia and New Zealand transacting 30 times per year.
We also look at the international expansion that this team has executed and demonstrated. Afterpay has shown an ability to grow quickly in new regions, including the U.S., which has been its fastest-growing market to date.
And then the alignment to the strategic priorities of Cash App and Seller where Afterpay's Buy Now Pay Later product can help strengthen our existing ecosystems and help -- we can help Afterpay expand with small- and medium-sized businesses in in-person and additional verticals.
So these volume metrics that we've done -- that Afterpay has demonstrated with merchants, whether it's 25% uplift in transaction size or 20% uplift in conversion rates and in purchase frequency and the lead generation they've demonstrated for merchants with 1 million leads per day, as Nick said, these are stats of a healthy foundation on which we can build together to accelerate growth across both the Afterpay ecosystem as well as cash and seller. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. And definitely congrats on the deal here. A lot of synergies to think about. So I was hoping to get -- Nick, good to have you on the call. Nick, your perspective on what synergies you're most excited about. And then maybe same thing from you, Jack, what are you excited about from a synergy standpoint, if you could rank the top things. I'm just curious how long will the Afterpay founders stay on the deals, we're thinking about integration here. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Nice to hear from you. So from an Afterpay perspective, Square absolutely helps us accelerate our priorities of long-term growth and particularly in the U.S. If you think of both sides of the equation, Square Seller business can help us drive a more diverse set of retail verticals beyond just retail where we're primarily orientated. So to have millions of sellers on one side of the equation to help us expand further into in-person commerce and serving SMB merchant is a critical focus for us on the merchant side.
And then when you think about the Cash App consumer side of the equation, cash that brings up the highly engaged customer base annual transacting of 70 million. And that broad ecosystem of product allows us to really lean into how we drive value for both our consumers and our retailers.
So as Amrita mentioned before, Afterpay on average delivered 1 million leads per day as a result of 16 million annual active consumers over the last 12 months. So to be able to have a partner like Cash App that has a significantly larger consumer base, we firmly believe we can drive significantly increased value to our retailers beyond what we do today.
And just the second question just on Ant and myself, and I hope Ant let me speaking on his behalf. But we've been just increasingly excited as conversations progress. We're as excited today as the day we started the organization. I really think that's a testament to Jack, Amrita, Brian, Alyssa and the whole Square team, the alignment of mission, vision, culture and values was just imminently apparent the more we got to know each other. And can't wait to take this partnership long into the future. And from our side, I think as I said in my last answer, we get the question all the time on this call, like what are some ways that you are all thinking about connecting the Seller and the Cash App ecosystem. And this one is massive and also obvious. We think from a seller perspective, the most obvious point is this is yet another tool to help drive more sales to a seller and also help us reach sellers that we have not been able to serve in the past. And that includes larger, more enterprise global retail sellers. And for us to be able to scale from the smallest of shops in your neighborhood up to the largest retailers in the world with one solution that brings people to the rest of our ecosystem is exactly in our ecosystem strategy, and this gives us a lot of fuel to continue to expand that.
On the Cash App side, this is a new payment capability. So adding more capabilities to Cash App customers that they can have a choice on how they're interacting with the economy is pretty incredible. But also given that a lot of the consumer side is going to be focused on discovery, first and foremost, will give Cash App a way to provide more daily value, something that people want to open up every single day to check out what's new and to see our entire ecosystem with services within the Cash App as well.
So you combine these 2 together, you get a strong connection between ecosystems. But even if they weren't connected, we have a lot of strength for each ecosystem. But again, I think the power and the true value of our company over the long term is how we connect all these systems -- all of these ecosystems together, starting with Seller and Cash App, but obviously it goes bigger than that years ahead. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. All right. Congrats on this. You clearly outperformed getting Cash App gross profit, and it was pretty clear at every engagement levels when you look at the comments you made of 2/3 of users transacting every week. When we consider that and now the combination with Afterpay, if you could just, a, touch on what's really driving that incremental engagement on the Cash App side; how much more room it has; and then probably more importantly, as you think of integration with Afterpay and what that can mean. Afterpay's revenue per user is even higher, I think. Can you just touch on, a, the work ahead to get done to actually integrate the 2 together, what we can envision and timing around it? And then what that means for engagement opportunities between the 2. Thanks, Darrin. I can kick us off on this one.  I'll start with sharing a bit more about that growing engagement we've seen on Cash App and then share more about what that means in integration with Afterpay.  From a Cash App perspective, we've seen that as we've added that weekly and daily utility with additional products and features and functionality in the Cash App that our customers have exhibited growing engagement with us. Weekly actives have steadily increased as a percent of monthly actives over time with nearly now 2/3 of our monthly -- 40 million monthly actives using Cash App each week on average in June.
This engagement has, in turn, driven monetization as inflows and product adoption has increased. Gross profit per transacting active was up 2.5x from 2 years ago in the quarter and up 1/3 from just 2 quarters ago. Historically, what we've seen is that the average customer who adopts 2 or more products in Cash App generates 3x to 4x the gross profit compared to the average peer-to-peer customer.
And we believe that integrating the Afterpay App into Cash App has the opportunity to drive that commerce discovery that Jack was speaking to, to drive further consumer engagement that also benefits merchants in the form of lead generation. This means that consumers will be able to browse merchants, purchase goods or services within Cash App and use Buy Now Pay Later at the checkout, allowing the consumer to pay for interest -- pre-installments directly from Cash App, again, driving that recurring engagement.
And we see this has a natural extension -- this is really represents natural extension of Cash App's current ecosystem around spending and rewards. Obviously, from a spending perspective, we've seen strong adoption with Cash Card at 10 million monthly actives as of March and 7 million weekly actives with spend per customer increasing over time. And from a rewards perspective, Boost is currently an engagement and merchant marketing tool, and it could be used at scale as a compelling acquisition tool for Afterpay's enterprise merchants while also providing that increased utility for Cash App customers. So we see the potential in the integration of Afterpay into Cash App to drive greater utility for our customers and ultimately greater lifetime value and ARPU for us over time. Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Great. I want to dig in a little bit an area of synergy that you highlighted a few times in the prepared remarks and also in the letter last night, but the -- or the slides around the larger seller opportunities, so the opportunity to introduce the Square ecosystem to those larger merchants that work with Afterpay. Maybe we could just bring that to life a little bit more, what type -- what aspects of the ecosystem might be most appealing and what that road map might look like? Yes. Thanks for the question, Tim. This is obviously an area that gets us really excited because the more we can expand the boundaries of what types of merchants and what sizes of merchants we can offer our products to, the better off our ecosystem is. So there's millions of [ Seller seeds ] spread around the business. Today across large to small e-commerce sites, restaurants, things pickup and delivery, we have a larger in-person presence than Afterpay has today and $60 billion of interest in volumes with $80 billion in omnichannel volumes growing quickly. But Afterpay can provide access to a number of, as I said in my previous answer, enterprise and retail merchants with a global presence, where sellers can help move to omnichannel and expand to more in-person commerce.
So a big part of our thesis and strategy around our ecosystem is making sure that we have a service and feature of our products that the seller can hire. And it may be specific to them, but that allows the door to open to the rest of our ecosystem. And we want to make sure that all of our products and services, all of our features scale from the smallest to the very largest. So it doesn't matter how they come in. We want to make sure that once they do come in, they see everything that -- else we have to offer and they're hiring us for multiple jobs, not just the one that they came into the system for.
So we have a similar play on the consumer side with Cash App, but this -- on the seller side, gives us a greater tool to sell to enterprise, larger global retail merchants in a way that we just haven't had in the past. And again, why that matters is because we can introduce them to the larger ecosystem as well. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Congrats on the deal from me as well. Thinking about this space, there's lots of large players entering this attractive BNPL sector, PayPal, Amex and even Apple. So how does Afterpay/Square differentiate solution versus the competition and make sure that overall in the industry, we just don't see further competition, pushing take rate down? I can start with this. I think, first and foremost, where we believe we're most differentiated is our combined ecosystem, ecosystem [ charging ]. So we see a lot of competitors with a seller ecosystem or a consumer ecosystem, but there are very, very few with both together.
And as you look at the market, having the ability for a seller to come in for Buy Now and Pay Later but also have the entire suite of tools they need to run the rest of the business is pretty magical. And it's magical because it saves them a lot of time. They don't have to spend a lot of time connecting different vendors together. They can focus entirely on just building the business. And while it seems that's important for the smaller companies, it's even more critical for the larger companies, even the enterprise global retailers as well.
So our model and our strategy is really focused on this fundamental principle of we have 2 ecosystems at scale serving both sides [ together ]. And the more we can connect them together to be seamless, the more value we can create both for the merchants, for the individuals, for the customers and also for our company as well. Maybe Nick can speak to this. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jack. Look, from my perspective, we've differentiated ourselves over the years by providing -- or looking at it through the lens of what value can we drive to the retailer. So naturally, our retailers see value in our core payment platform, and it delivers higher average order value, increased return rates, low -- lower return rates, increased conversion rates.
But the undercurrent here of how retailers really assess us in the business performance is, can we actually drive new business to their platform? Can we act as a customer acquisition channel for the retailer and drive business to them? And as I mentioned before, on average, sending 1 million leads per day over the course of the last 12 months to our retailers shows that we can perform not just not just through the core payment platform, but actually add value directly. And there aren't a lot of payment providers that have successfully built a platform that has the ability to drive new business to retailers.
So when I think about what we've been able to achieve as a result of reaching 16 million annual active consumers, the ability to couple that with 70 million annual active Cash App consumers and the ecosystem that unfolds as a result of that, the value we can drive to our retailers, I believe, is demonstrably greater than the existing strong results that we've been able to perform. So really excited about it from that perspective on our side. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. I wanted to ask about how Afterpay kind of advances the Square international market strategy. Can we expect you to build out a broader presence for Square, for example, Square products and global markets where Afterpay may already be operating where maybe -- maybe where Square isn't? Any color around international strategy would be appreciated. Sure. Thanks for the question, Ramsey. Maybe I can kick off and Nick you can add in. Global expansion has been a top priority, as you know, for Cash App and Seller, and we see our geographic presence as complementary with Afterpay. Afterpay has driven strong growth across Australia, New Zealand and, more recently, U.S. and Canada and the U.K. with recent launches as well across Europe, in Spain, France and Italy. And Afterpay has grown both its consumer and merchant presence in these markets.
We see that, that growing global presence allows for easier entry into new markets and help us potentially expand in markets where we already exist but have a smaller presence as well as potentially those new markets. The vast majority of Cash App and seller GPV are from the U.S. today, but we're already on that pathway of growing in existing markets.
Sellers for markets outside the U.S. are achieving close to U.S. payback levels on investment. We're closing the product parity gap. We're seeing growth rates in those markets at 2x the U.S. And we're now launching in new markets, most recently in Ireland and with the France beta as well.
So Afterpay's footprint and expertise can further enable our expansion whether in geographies where we're both present as well as new geographies together. And that opportunity to strengthen our combined product offering and acquire new customers together is profound when you think globally. And then, Amrita, if I can add, from an Afterpay perspective, we've been focused on global expansion as well. As Jack mentioned earlier, that strength from an enterprise retail perspective and the ability to go global with your global retailers has been a core focus for us. Since launching in North America just 3 years ago, we're seeing very strong growth in the region and particularly in the U.S. The U.S. now for us represents our largest consumer base from any country in FY '21. And it's been our fastest-growing geo on a volume basis.
So we want to focus more investment in the U.S., which is why we see such a strategic opportunity to join Square and the combination with Cash App and seller as I've spoken about a few times, I think, provides the 2 sides of the equation.
And similarly, we recently announced the launch of Money by Afterpay, been experiencing -- sorry, we have this existing product in geos where Cash App doesn't exist today, which we can help leverage to help Cash App reach more geographies. So together, I believe there's a long-term opportunity here to explore and learn about new geographies. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question just about buy versus build, and maybe if you can talk more specifically about the pros and cons that you may have considered of entering the BNPL space by buying as opposed to building. I'm wondering if you actively considered the latter options, and Square obviously has a strong legacy of organic innovation. Yes. I mean we're always considering the options we have before us. But in this particular case, it really came back to Nick and Ant and the team and how innovative they've been and how early they were in the space and how strong their ambition is and how much it complements our strategy. It allows us to move much faster, achieves a bunch of our goals in terms of expanding the types and sizes of merchants that we can reach. And there was just an obvious connection into our current ecosystem that made us all even stronger.
So I think we get a lot of wisdom, a lot of knowledge, a lot of customer understanding by going this route. And that will set us up for a much stronger future where we can move much, much faster if we were to just start from scratch. And We get 2 incredible leaders in a company to continue to build out not just Afterpay, but have opinion on the rest of our business as well and continue to raise the bar on what we're able to do. And Jack, maybe I can add from an Afterpay perspective. We're certainly at the early days for Buy Now Pay Later being at 2% penetration of e-comm and even less of the overall credit card spend. So from Ant and my perspective, the combination of our companies aligns with our long-term objectives of financial inclusion. And as Jack just mentioned during our conversation, we've discovered an incredibly strong alignment between the leadership teams.
It's one thing to have on paper what your values, mission and vision look like. But the way that each of our teams live and breathe our mission of economic empowerment and financial inclusion was incredibly clear and apparent. So yes, look, we see huge opportunity in our combined combination accelerating, our shared mission and long-term vision and growth. And we're excited about this announcement today.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin a call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Recorded results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements except as required by law.
During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of October. These represent our current estimate for October performance, as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of October and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual October results may differ from these estimates. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for your time today. In our seller ecosystem, we continue to build upon our omnichannel capability and those efforts have enabled us to attract and retain larger sellers while also helping our existing sellers grow our market. This quarter, we enhanced our square invoices product to help sellers more efficiently run their business. Square invoices enables sellers to easily build clients and get paid quickly, in person, online or over the phone.
In the third quarter, we introduced Square Invoices Plus, a new subscription product with more advanced features designed for larger and more complex businesses. We also continue to expand our geographic reach, launching a full stack of integrated seller tools in France in September,, our most robust market launch yet. French businesses can now sell online and in person with Square's integrated suite of products, including Square Point of Sale, Square For Restaurants, Square Online, Square Terminal, Square Stand, Square Reader and more. We're excited about France given its strong small business environment, increased usage in contactless payments and it's fast growing eCommerce sector.
Switching to Cash App, we reached some major milestone in this quarter in expanding our offerings to families by serving teams and entirely new demographic for Cash App. With this launch customers in the US between the ages of 13 and 17 get access to Cash Apps, massive P2P network, the cash card, direct deposit and boost, all with parental or guardian approval. By lowering the age barrier, we hope to expand access to the financial system to 20 million teams in the US and equip them with the tools they need to participate in the cashless economy, which is especially important now, as transacting with physical cash becomes less relevant in the increasingly digital world.
With Cash App, families can help their teams learn about how to manage the money they earn from the allowance, jobs and chores with the appropriate protections in place. As we've talked about, our string flies in our ecosystem model, especially as our ecosystems connect together. In the third quarter, we launch Cash App pay in the US a new contactless payment method for online and in person transactions with Cash App pay individuals can seamlessly pay with their Cash App account as Square sellers using the QR code, they're tapping a button on their mobile device of checkout.
As contactless options into ours have become more mainstream Cash App pay has become a top requested feature by both Cash App customers and Square sellers. This integration further expands Cash App's commerce capabilities, and helps us meet customers where they are providing more flexibility in their payment options. Cash App pay also enables us to offer sellers a new and innovative way to bring commerce to life for their customer.
Lastly, we continue to serve our purpose of economic empowerment and all that we do, but we want to build on that strength to explore opportunities beyond our existing ecosystems to serve new markets. We have a few emerging initiatives who are investing behind into 2022. For example, with the acquisition of TIDAL, we're building tools for artists, starting with new additions. We also recently created a business called TBD in order to build an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial permissionless and decentralized financial services with a focus on Bitcoin. We plan to share detailed plans with a white paper later this month.
We announced two more Bitcoin initiatives as well, a consumer Bitcoin hardware wallet, and a Bitcoin mining system, both are focused on helping Bitcoin reach a mainstream audience while at the same time, strengthening the network and ecosystem. We'll build both in the open in collaboration with the community, sharing all of our decisions, progress and questions along the way. We see each of these long term opportunities that we'll be learning from over multiple years.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amrita. Thanks Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover today. First, a look at our performance in the third quarter of 2021; second, an update on our seller and Cash App ecosystems in October and third, a look at where we intend to invest in the fourth quarter of 2021 and in 2022, given the compelling growth opportunities ahead.
In the third quarter, gross profit was $1.13 billion, an increase of 43% year-over-year or 51% on a two year CAGR basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $233 million. Both Seller and Cash App showed strong fundamentals during the quarter. Seller generated gross profit of $606 million of 48% year over year or 29% on a two year CAGR basis. A few growth drivers to call out here.
First we've made strides growing up market as our ecosystem has resonated with larger sellers. In the third quarter, mid-market sellers are those with more than $0.5 million in annualized GPV, grew gross profit, nearly twice as fast as our overall seller business on a two year CAGR basis and have surpassed micro sellers make up our largest segment of GPV.
Our momentum with mid-market sellers in recent quarters has been driven by acquisition of larger sellers, as well as our ability to help small sellers grow on our platform. Second, software and integrated payments remain the fastest growing product in the seller ecosystem on a gross profit basis as sellers value the breadth of our ecosystem, Square invoices in particular experienced strong growth processing, $12 billion in GPV the last 12 months up nearly 2X from two years ago.
Cash App generated gross profit of $512 million up 33% year over year or 104% on a two year CAGR basis with strong engagement in inflows, inflows or money pulled into our ecosystem, achieved strong growth on a two-year CAGR basis even as most government disbursement programs ended. Product adoption has been a key driver of overall inflows, and we continue to see an increase in attach rate for products using cash cards.
In the third quarter, cash card active brought in approximately 70% more inflows each month than non-cash card actives. We also saw an increase in paycheck deposits as we've made direct deposit and bank transfers easier and more visible to customers.
Next, we wanted to share an update on our business through October and what we're seeing real time. As a reminder, we believe two year CAGRs will better reflect underlying trends in our business. For Seller, we expect gross profit in October to grow by 45% year over year or approximately 30% on a two year CAGR basis relatively in line with growth in third quarter. Fellow GPV was up 24% on a two year CAGR basis. We've been encouraged by relatively stable growth rates in the past few quarters though, we recognize there are still impacts from COVID in certain parts of the US and our international markets, which could impact GPV trends.
For Cash App in October, we expect gross profit growth of greater than 35% year over year or greater than 90% on a two year CAGR basis. As we had expected, we saw normalization in the two-year gross profit CAGR from July to October as government disbursements ended. On a year over year basis, gross profit growth has been relatively stable around the 35% range from August through October. We've seen strong engagement here across our broader ecosystem of products and are enthusiastic about our recent launches and product roadmap, which brings me to our intended investments for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the preliminary view of our focus areas for 2022.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding risk loss by approximately $115 million compared to the third quarter. Looking to 2022, we see significant investment opportunities across our business and remain focused on driving long term profitable growth. Next year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses by approximately 40% year over year compared to 2021. We're approximately $1.3 billion of incremental spend across product development to build out our team, sales and marketing to drive acquisition and G&A to expand support in each of our ecosystems. This figure excludes impacts from after pay, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2022.
Let's take a look at where we're focused, where we're focusing our investment. For Seller, we'll be investing behind our strategic priorities of enabling omnichannel, growing globally and growing up market with larger Seller. Given the strong growth and lifetime value and gross profit per customer that we've seen over time in our seller business more comfortable, lengthening our payback periods up to the six quarter range as we scale sales and marketing and increase our mix of go to market investments across international, brand awareness and our sales teams.
For Cash App, our strategic priorities remain strengthening our network, driving engagement and attracting more inflows into our ecosystem. Heading into 2022, we're focused on advancing these priorities by investing behind new and emerging product areas. First enabling more commerce for our customers, including our recent launch of Cash App pay and potential future opportunities with after pay, following the closing of the transaction. Second, providing more financial services by expanding our product set and unlocking new info channels in the Cash App and third, improving the health of our platform and promoting positive behavior by growing support and expanding access.
Finally, as Jack mentioned, we now also have emerging areas of growth that we're investing behind and we'll be tracking the progress against milestones over multiple years. These include Title, TBD, the hardware wallet and Bitcoin mining, which we expect will an aggregate represent roughly 5% of our incremental step up next year, for approximately $140 million in overall non-GAAP OpEx.
As we look ahead, we're excited for what the future holds for our company. We are going after a large and growing addressable market, and we see strong signals on how our products resonate for our customers with compelling unit economics. As a result, we are deliberately investing to reach new audiences, increase the utility for existing customers and expand our products set as we have done over time.
I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator instructions] We have the first question come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question, Thanks so much. And thanks for the update. I wanted to ask about Cash App pay if that's okay. And I know Jack, you've been talking about connecting the two ecosystem. So how important is this in that effort? And what's the strategy to grow this payment method overall, I've been thinking that you'll need to drive more inflows like direct deposit to really get it going. So maybe if you don't mind updating us on the inflow strategy, that'd be great. Thanks. Yeah. So I would foresee this as a focus on the importance of Cash App moving more and more into commerce relationship. So, we have these incredible firewall loop and network effects and peer to peer, and now we get to look forward towards being more of a commerce front end. Fortunately, we have another ecosystem at scale that focuses on Sellers and omnichannel commerce. So it's easy for us to test a lot of these theories out and actually scale them up over time.
Obviously, we do believe that having these multiple ecosystems is our ultimate superpower and differentiator. So, have both ends of the counter two different audiences and sellers and individuals is really important. There's a thesis behind after pay as well. And that probably represents some largest potential for connecting the ecosystems, but any connection we make between these ecosystems strengthens the overall value of a broader ecosystem and we think our value to customers and the company generally as well.
In terms of direct deposit, direct deposit is one form of info. We've done a lot to make sure that we are making it more accessible. We're putting it more upfront in the interface. You'll, notice a bunch of navigational changes that we made. So more of a focus on direct deposit, but generally, there's a number of ways people get money into cash out, not just the pay check, but tax refund, stimulus checks and we want to make sure that it's intuitive and easy for all those and be ready for when people on scale.
I think, the other announcement to look towards in this light is what we just did for families. So allowing any parent or guardian to turn on Cash App for their kids who can also use peer to peer direct deposit and the cash card unlocks an entirely new population for us and will still benefit it from those base level network effects that have grown and Cash App in the first place. So we have a -- we're going after this problem in multiple ways in our phase new products and features like Cash App for families. And then taking every opportunity we have to connect our ecosystem. But the, the thing that I think is most interesting here in cash pay is that it really allows us to open the door around Cash App being a commerce front end. And next question, we have the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Hey, thanks guys. Nice trends. I just want to start off and kind of follow up on tangents question around Cash App a bit, just given the impact of stimulus. It's likely running off a bit now and it's, I think it's still impressive to see two year CAERS at a hundred, 4%, but just really love to hear what your view is on the drivers of incremental engagement per user, like sort of touching on the new capabilities and strategies from here on, out for Cash App really pre after pay along with the potential levels, we'd be able to reach just thinking about what the potential engagement, transaction levels, revenue per user, where that can go over the next couple years. Thanks guys. Hey, Darren, happy to take that one. I think it's instructive to look at where Cash App is focusing from a priority perspective, both an aggregate across the ecosystem, as well as from a product development perspective, to inform where we could see potential future growth. So as ever in, as we head into the fourth quarter and into 2022, our strategic priorities remain strengthening our overall network, driving engagement and attracting more in flows and to advance these priorities, we'll continue investing behind product development, sales, and marketing for customer acquisition and support and operations, which underpins the entire platform from a product development perspective.
We're prioritizing a few longer term focus areas, which I think really get to your question around how we drive long term growth RPO and my 10 value for our customers by ultimately driving greater utility for our customers. So first from a commerce perspective, as you've heard from Jack at the beginning of building out a commerce platform for Cash App, you see that with Cash App pay, you see that with teams, you see that with what we're going to be doing in the future with after pay and other new experiences to of greater utility and engagement from a financial services perspective, we're expanding our banking capabilities, including new info channels into Cash App and exploring new products like borrow to help drive engagement and attract more inflows into the network from a health perspective, we're scaling support or expanding acts us.
And we're doing this responsibly to encourage good behavior on our platform, which again, further strengthens the network effects and, and the ability for people to bring funds in and use them across multiple products. And we're building out fulls stack teams dedicated to each of these areas in 2022. And you'll see that in our hiring plans in product to drive continued product roadmap, velocity, from a marketing perspective, we're investing to drive acquisition for new customers, with a focus on reaching higher lifetime value customers and newer demographics.
And as we've seen gross profit and lifetime value per customer grow historically, we've be to increase our customer acquisition costs above the historical $5 range which we believed is too efficient. Given the opportunities that we see ahead. So some of the levers that go into that to drive investment in 2022 and future growth, paid marketing, this is where we can ramp our paid channels.
And as a grow portion of our spend referrals, which makes enhancement to, we're going to make an enhancement to the overall referral program and use it as a way to cross-sell our ecosystem as well and awareness, which grows the ability to, for people to come in and, and adopt products beyond peer to peer and, and includes reaching CU new types of customers beyond our existing demographics.
And it advances Cash App life, lifestyle brand as a true differentiator and finally support. And the, and the foundation on which our platform is built. The growth of Cash App has outpaced our investment, frankly with customers are adopting, adopting more and more products. And in 2022, we're going to grow our health team. We'll continue to build out our support and our infrastructure to align with Cash App to sound and growth. Part of that is deposits and limits initiatives to reduce friction around inflow sources and add new inflow channels.
And part of it is, some of the more recent things you've seen, like we recently launched in-app support messaging to all customers and that's quickly become the majority of inquiries. We'll be dynamic with the spend we'll track returns, but we're excited about these initiatives strategic initiatives and investment areas to drive future growth for us, ultimately driving utility and engagement with the Cash App ecosystem. Thank you. Next question we have a question from [indiscernible]. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Hello, my name is Andrea. I'm a business owner here in San Antonio, Texas. I owned a crafted donut shop and we use mainly all Square features available at the moment. My question was like growing from a food truck to a brick and mortar location, as we continue to expand. One of the most important things is to ensure that we have all the integrated products we need to roll up market and do you -- can we expect to see Square introduce features as we look to expand? Yeah. A 100% and thank you for using square. So, we built ecosystem with exactly this in mind. We, we started close to 13 years ago with a very simple solution of accepting credit cards. And that was meant for, so proprietors and the smallest of businesses, but we wanted to make sure that we were able to scale ahead of our seller's ambitions.
So if they decided to get a physical location, they decided to have multiple locations hire more employees, all those things we, we didn't want to get in the way of that. So all of our tools are meant to scale from the very small, to the very large and progressively disclose more or sophistication as the complexity of your business increases. One, one of recent areas that we wanted to help solve is around employee management.
And we acquired this company called crew that allows us to that, that allows our sellers to have a mess platform so that they can help manage all of their employees and, and all their needs so they can continue to focus on what's most important, which is their, their customers. So it's really important to us that we're not getting in the way of any of our seller growth. And I think we, we show that by being of, of live very small, but also of the largest, like stadiums who have thousands of vendors of all sizes working. Thank you. We have, the next question comes on the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. You may ask a question Good afternoon. Thanks. I'm going to switch over to the seller ecosystem. You called out Sellers international expansion in the prepared remarks, particularly the recent expansion into France. Can you just remind us how much of Sellers' GP is derived from ex US markets and how fast that piece is growing and looking forward, maybe for Amrita where your priority investment areas are looking internationally as you look into '22, thank you? Maybe I'll start this off and Amrita make a follow. So as we look at a new market for, for sellers we want to make sure that we're number one looking at the, the market and understanding like the level of small businesses and entrepreneurship with one and then we want to invest in brand and product awareness. And then after that, it's not just launching one product, but getting to parody across all of our products across all of our global geos. And then finally, like look at expanding into new markets where we think there's a high potential for success.
Because, we do require a, a partnership with a, a local bank and there's differences in local regulatory. This has to be a very deliberate decision. So we've made very conscious choices around what markets square in and why. And there's still a lot of opportunity for us to open more of our products in more of the markets that we're already in, such as square loans in more of the places that we already exist. So that is our focus. So it's a balance between getting into parity in the markets that we're in with all of our products, but also looking at, at entirely new markets as well, France being the, the most. And Lisa I'll add that, our markets outside the us have seen strong growth in the third quarter, despite periodic lockdowns. We saw those markets growing faster than the us, so they are growing cause within our national markets are growing as a mix of our seller business. And they continue to, to your point about next year and our future strategic priorities, they continue to be a key focus area for us in investment opportunity for the future. As I said, sellers, strategic priorities.
As we look ahead are enabling omnichannel going global and growing up market on the going global piece to your question, it's a key part of our sales and marketing initiatives for next year and a key piece of why we're comfortable expanding our paybacks up to the six quarter range. As we see a greater mix of spend in sales and marketing towards brand spend and international areas, what those key sales and marketing investments are brand and awareness to drive, reach, and top of funnel demand, particularly with larger sellers and across the breadth of the ecosystem for which continues to be our largest percentage of mix.
And then global, scaling sales and marketing in these markets outside the us, where which is growing faster than the us and where we've seen paybacks improve over time, where we'll be ramping our spend in these markets outside the us in 2022, given the new geographies that we're in, include France Ireland and with the beta in Spain, as well as potential new launches for the future. We expect these areas to have lower ROI in early years and improve our over time. And we see them as a critical strategic area for us for the future that we want to invest into given the strong product market fit and how our products are resonating in these markets.
It's also a key piece of the investments we make, of course, in product development to localize and expand these services and features for each of these markets closing the product app that Jack was talking about these international markets and from a support perspective, to make sure that these sellers can reach us with any of their needs across international, as well as the us. So key focus area for us, and very strategic for the future. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Great, thank you for digging the question. I want to dig into the large seller approach in 2022 and beyond. And I'm really bringing this up in light is the potential for a more bundled approach to work with those large sellers. And that's including some of the big online enterprise customers that have relationships with after pay.
So I was hoping we could talk just a little bit about that full suite or bundle of offerings that could be sold into those large seller, whether, whether it's by now pay later the Cash App pay button or your more traditional payments processing or unbranded, if you will. And then of course, other services that square offers and really the thought being there is it might allow square to have a more competitive or sort of a unique angle when talking with those large enterprises. Yeah, this is exactly it. As I said earlier, this is one of our, one of our biggest strengths is that we, we do have ecosystems that are cohesive. They're very broad in their tool sets. So it allows us to reach sellers in a much more cohesive way, especially given the maturity of our developer platforms or the I, or your seller. And I have legacy tools or tools I that are very custom and specific to me.
I can still integrate with square in a way that that's needed are definitely point to the number of stadiums that we've turned on as proof of that. And that also shows like the potential for, for bundling, as you say we believe that after closing the transaction, after they can add really drive commerce across both sellers and individuals we think it's a really smart connection between the two ecosystems, obviously after pay is has done very well with larger retailers. And that's both on the seller side and also on the individual side where I think there's natural homes within the, our seller business and also cash up. So back to the comment on cash app.
Hey, like the more word cash app is seen as a commerce front end from discovery to transactions the stronger our relationship the brain, and that's not just on the cash app side, but also on the square seller side. And as we worked to integrate app with the transaction closes, we have even more opportunity. Thank you. Next question we had the line of Trevor Williams of Jefferies. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Great, thanks. Good afternoon. And I'll throw another one in on the cash app. So as we look at the size of your user base at $40 million monthly actives that puts you at a scale that very few thanks or close to I mean, how do you think of the benefits of scale or what competitive advantage a larger user base gives you beyond just having more users to monetize when you have network effects on the peer-to-peer side.
But just trying to get at how a larger user base can unlock a higher level of monetization. I mean, the benefit from when you plug in after Afterpay, that seems pretty clear, but just thinking more on cash app as a standalone today, really what the scale advantages are. Thanks so much. Yeah, I think number one, like it, it gives us a lot more opportunity to strengthen our existing products, but also create new products on top of cash up as the foundation. And, and those can be products for both individuals and customers, but also for sellers as well as more and more commerce moves online and purely digital and is not found offline. We, do have businesses using cash app because it's the way for them to transact and it's familiar for their customers and even that builds upon the network effect.
But I, guess I would directionally point you back to discovery with a larger base of customers, we get more opportunities to introduce discovery features to our network. And, we have the starts of those things and boost for instance where a we can, we can highlight a particular activity or a particular seller whether it be in your neighborhood or nationwide.
And I think there's a lot more to come there and we have the benefit of again, having a seller network and ecosystem that we can further turn on to all of our passionate customers. And as we have no more as we have a compelling product experience around discovery local and businesses around me become really important and they, and they open access even the, to it to an even greater degree. So I think there's, there's a lot of potential and having the scale we have, but I, I, I feel we can go much, much higher and that's the intention then, especially as we think about cash up outsides the US and UK, which for insights me as well as being more global. And I have Trevor that I think a key focus area for us is the engagement of this customer base. as we said, back in June, nearly two thirds of those $40 million monthly actives that you referenced transacted each week on average across our cash app ecosystem. So the more we can do there to make this a daily utility to make our ability to provide customers value on a regular basis. And throughout the day, the more opportunity we have to drive further network effects, drive further engagement and ultimately drive higher lifetime values, which then enables us to invest back into the ecosystem and provide differentiated value to these customers. So I think both the reach of the network and the driving continued engagement are key priorities for us. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat at Bernstein. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jack, I wonder follow-up in your prepared remarks regarding Bitcoin. Are you looking to expand into crypto beyond Bitcoin, buy and sell, for example, buy and sell other cryptocurrencies and also enabling your users to kind of engage in defined NSP assistance. Thank you. We're not. Our focus is on helping Bitcoins become the native currency for the internet. And we want to, we have a number of initiatives towards that goal cash app is just one. We're going to be building a hardware wallet, they're exploring Bitcoin mining, a consumer device to, to mind the claim at home or in a business our solid businesses.
In fact we, we believe, this focus is important. We believe it's right. And a lot of it has to do with the, the resilience, the fundamentals, the principles that Bitcoin offers. And we also want to make sure that we're giving back to the community as much as possible in this is also reflected in our approaches for Bitcoin wallet, Bitcoin mining.
And our new business unit called TBD, which is focused on building a developer platform to enable more ideas around decentralized finance on the Bitcoin stack and all that stability that offers and, all the resilience that's had over the decade plus. So we're going to release more details on what TBD is steering with a white paper on November 19 and we're really excited about the direction and excited about our focus. Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Josh Beck of KBCM. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Thank you team for taking the question. I wanted to shift gears back to cash app. Obviously the demographic on the age is expanding and certainly getting into that 13 plus category. So I'm curious what you view as the defining elements of cash app for that segment. Obviously there are a couple of five and companies also focus on teens and tweens, if you will. So just curious on how you frame that and where you see that opportunity in the next few years. Yeah. This is a really big launch for us because we're, it's been a huge request by Cash customers. But we're there we're finally able to fulfill obviously the sister must have a larger population now we don't have access to before 29 teens in the United States. But then it's going to our fundamentals that are showing the peer to peer fundamentals.
Just receiving family, received money from your friend who send money to your friends or from your, your parents being able to get a cash card design a cash app card, even the cash card that goes in the dark and being able to use it and take my parents can send me my allowance or I can own the workforce and actually use the direct deposit function on it.
So most everything that you would expect from cash app will exist with this feature side, but you will have controls for the parents or guardian. So we think it's a great way to get into the space. It's a start. We, we definitely have to expand it. But all the strength that we have in building the network effects of art or business and all the products that we, that we offer we benefit now from a much larger audience and we'll continue to take on the responsibility and health we have with things like the claim and the savings account and cash card and stocks as we, as we have with the main cash app.
So we always want to provide as much information as possible, so people can be responsible and healthy with their finances. And in we'll definitely include, probably think about cash up for families in pertains Josh. I would, I would just add that. I think some of the key differentiating factors for cash app here is the scale of the network effects, which the utility ultimately for these teams and for their families and the aspirational brand that cash app has cultivated through the years, which is truly authentic, certainly with gen Z and certainly with this audience.
And then third, as Jack said, the strength of the broader network, the fact that it's not just cash card, it's not just peer to peer, but there's so many other things that you'll be able to do over time which enables that sort of financial inclusion for this audience. And those are the things that truly differentiate cash app for, for this product and for this audience. Thank you. We have the next question comes into the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this evening. I wanted to ask about an ACH acceptance tool that I think you guys announced earlier in the year in partnership with Platt, and it's sort of at a high level. What are your thoughts more broadly on pay by bank and other types of payments that don't rely on the traditional card rails? And maybe if I can tack one on, are you planning to offer a pay with Bitcoins feature through cash app pay at some point next? Yeah, so I think what you're referencing is maybe the sellers accepting bank transfer payments which definitely have a lower processing piece. So we're, we're always looking for opportunities to add efficiency to the sack, both for sellers and for cash up. As soon as we have, as we have the foundational infrastructure and interface in place we find ways to make it even more efficient, cheaper for our customers in terms of cash app pay in Bitcoin and specifically lightning functionality probably not rum.
It's definitely something that the foundation will allow. And we're, as I said before, like our focus is on helping Bitcoin to be the native currency in that. So currency aspects of it in the network are really important to us. And we're going to do more in that space. Thank you. We have, the next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Brian, you may ask your question. Hi guys. And thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask it about on the, how much stimulus is still impacting the numbers. Just curious on the saving rate for cash app users and their balances right now. And I know you guys are doing several things to get balances up on cash app. So just be interested in figuring out a little bit about that. Hey, happy to take this one. Maybe we'll hit balance as quickly. First we saw customer balances slightly down quarter, over quarter of 143% on a year over year basis. We would really warrant you though to look at info inflows more broadly. As balances are just a measure of growth at a snapshot in time at the end of the quarter. And so what we really orient to as we think about the health of the network is of course, as we said, overall, network size engagement, but also inflows.
What we've seen is that as we had expected as the government disbursements came to the end, largely during the third quarter, we found normalization in the two year K the rate on gross profit from July to October on a year over year basis, always seen relative stability from August to October in around that 35% range on a year-over-year basis.
In October, we expect growth on gross profit of greater than 35% year over year and greater than 90% on a two year CAGR basis. And then as we look ahead, of course, when we think about our customer spending power, which is ultimately what impacts inflows what we're focused on for the long-term is all those key priorities that we laid out for the year ahead around commerce platform that we're building around financial services around the health of the network, which enables us to ultimately bring more, deposits, more inflows into the ecosystem and enables our customers to then use them in more ways across the ecosystem. And I think ultimately that's in the medium to long-term. What drives inflows for cash app. Thank you. We have the next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Thanks so much. I'd like to better understand your closed loop strategy with Afterpay. We've been following your BNP L pilot and cash app, which appears to be defaulting payments to store balances. Given your stored balances were around 2 billion at the end of 2020, and constantly being refilled. It seems it be NPL with Afterpay at square sellers could generate significant transaction margin benefits. Can you help us better understand your closed loop strategy with Afterpay? Sure. I can jump in on this one. I think what we're focused on ultimately is the product experience for our customers and the commerce platform that we're building, which, this payment type enables us to drive things like in-app discovery within cash. And as we've seen with Afterpay that with their own app, they've been driving historically a million leads a day to some of their enterprise merchants.
So when you think about beyond just the payment type that B NPL enables, or even things like cash app pay enables, really the strategic imperative here for us is the commerce enablement. At the, that the integration of Afterpay enabled for us with, with both cash app and with our seller ecosystem, of course, there will be opportunities to think about cost savings over time, but the street needed focus is on commerce and in app discovery for us. Thank you. We have the next question come from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open. You may ask a question. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask as it relates to cash app and the importance of the cash card, can you remind us how penetrated cash card is within the cash app ecosystem and then maybe emerita, you can kind of update us on the breakdown of different revenue sources within cash app the instant PDP cash card and the like, thank you. Sure. So to hit cash card first, we continue to see strong adoption here for cash card with our customers. It is our highest attached product upside a peer-to-peer and what we had shared back in March is that 7 million customers within cash up or using cash card on a weekly basis, we're seeing it drive regular utility for our customers. That rate of weekly usage had nearly doubled year over year, going faster than the monthly active cash card customers.
They're using cash. Our customers are using the card for everyday purchases for food, for transportation at major retailers, really signaling that customers want to use cash card to manage their everyday expenses. Obviously, boost is a piece of that with a unique rewards and offerings that we have here to drive that utility and awareness around card. And we've also been working on expanding functionality for cash card globally as a third quarter.
Customers can now use cash card in-person and online in many countries outside the us. And when we think about the importance of driving attached to products like cash card, what we see is that these customers are highly engaged across our ecosystem on other products.
Historically, we've seen cash card access dots, nearly twice the number of products as non-cash card customers, which has led to greater money brought into cash app. Overall, obviously we shared that stat that in this quarter cash card active brought 70% more inflows into the ecosystem on average than non-cash card active. And it was a key driver of overall info growth for us. So we see a real opportunity here to grow engagement and monetization, both with cash card and beyond cash card buy as customers take on more and more products like investing in direct deposit and on, I think the second part of your question is the breakdown of revenue sources.
We continue to see a diversification in how the utility of the different products we have within cash app. And it's a key focus area for us to drive that product adoption across cash app, as well as to drive ultimately monetization and regular engagement. And that is something that, especially as we look ahead, when we look at the product roadmap ahead, we expect to see even greater diversification over time. Thank you. And we have time for one last question. And that line comes from Ryan Klein [ph]. Your line is now open. You may ask a question, Hey, thinks. It's actually [indiscernible] here. Sorry for the mess up from Mizuho. Thanks for taking my question. So really quickly on, can you maybe quantify the potential upside from a credit online tax for next year for the cash app, if any, thank you. Yeah, just to, just to start, the reason we did this as it helps expand our direct deposit charges and brings more implosion, the catch up gives more information to customers to understand how tax filing will work on cash up. This is tax season and we think there's a lot of opportunity to simplify a bunch of tasks that one has to do in the financial system taxes is a big one. And we want to make sure that we have a successful product launch ahead of the tax refund season. So customers have a really seamless experience and we're highlighting direct, positive and another potentially powerful info for us. Thank you. That would be the last question. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating into this program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.",we will begin a call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions . the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date . this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website .,0.0

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Hi everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of January and February. These represent our gross profit growth results for January and our current estimate for February performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of February and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual January and February results may differ from these estimates. We will also provide preliminary unaudited financial results Afterpay in the second half of 2021. These results have not yet been audited or reviewed by our auditors. Actual results for Afterpay may differ materially from these preliminary results. Our remarks discuss losses on consumer receivables for Afterpay. Losses on consumer receivables represent an assessment of expected credit losses over the term of the receivables, which is 14 to 56 days. We believe losses on consumer receivables is comparable to Afterpay’s previously reported metric of gross losses. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you for joining us today. We wanted to start by acknowledging what's on everyone's mind, the Ukrainian people. Our thoughts are with them, our employees and customers are tied to the area and all those affected by war. Turning now to our quarter, 2021 was a busy year for us. We found new ways to connect our Square and Cash App ecosystems through the acquisition of Afterpay. We added new ecosystems with title to serve artists and TBD to serve Bitcoin developers. And we announced two new hardware projects to advance Bitcoin as the native currency for the internet, a non-custodial hardware wallet and a Bitcoin mining system. We've been wanting to dedicate the Square brand to our seller business unit for some time. So, we made that move too. And renamed the overall company Block. Block now contains four business units, Square, Cash App, Title and TBD. And now for some updates on our business. In Cash App, we saw strong engagement and adoption from both new and existing customers. In the fourth quarter, we added to the peer-to-peer functionality that has made Cash App so popular with an update that lets customers send fractional shares and Bitcoin from their Cash App balances to friends and family. We're also launching new features to position Cash App as a platform that can serve all of our customers' financial needs. In January we introduce Cash App Taxes where customers can file for free from a phone or computer and can receive their tax refund up to two days early, if deposited through Cash App. Historically we have seen customers bringing their tax refunds into Cash App and with Cash App Taxes, we hope to encourage customers to bring more inflows into our ecosystem and expand awareness of our direct deposit capabilities. Turning onto Square, we delivered on our priorities of expanding internationally, growing up market and building out our omnichannel capabilities to create cohesive experiences between sellers and the customers. For example, we know that photos are crucial for selling successfully online, but many sellers struggle with the time and cost required. To address this, in the fourth quarter, we introduce the Square Photo Studio, mobile app, which makes it easy for sellers to take high quality photos and directly sync them to the catalogue or online store. Between both ecosystems in January, we closed our acquisition of Afterpay and introduced Afterpay buy now, pay later for Square online sellers in the U.S. and Australia and offering that's been long requested by sellers and customers. Looking ahead, we intend to integrate buy now, pay later more deeply in our ecosystem over time. And we believe Afterpay will accelerate the connections between our Square and Cash ecosystems. We have a strong foundation to build upon in 2022. And we want to share more with all of you during an Investor Day we plan to host on May 18, where we'll go deeper into our mission, products, strategy, and long-term goals. We'll share more details as we get closer to the date. And with that, here’s Amrita. Thanks Jack. There are a few topics I'm going to cover today. First, the strong growth from our Cash App and Square ecosystems in 2021 and the compelling cohort economics driving those results. Second, Afterpay’s financial performance in the second half of 2021. Third, a look at our growth trends and investments in the first quarter and into the rest of 2022. Our business delivered strong growth in 2021 with gross profit of $4.42 billion up 62% year-over-year. With gross profit growth at 53% on a two-year CAGR basis we've more than doubled the scale of our business since 2019 and further diversified our products. In 2021 Square had six revenue streams that generated approximately $100 million or more in gross profit. And Cash App had four revenue streams with more than $200 million in gross profit. We delivered over a $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and generated meaningful free cashflow during the year demonstrating strong unit economics and incremental margins, which I'll come back to in a moment. In the fourth quarter gross profit was $1.18 billion and grew 47% year-over-year or 50% on a two-year CAGR basis. Adjust EBITDA was $184 million. Let's look at the drivers for Cash App and Square. Cash App generated gross profit of $518 million in the fourth quarter up 37% year-over-year or 90% on a two-year CAGR basis behind strong engagement and inflows. We grew Cash App’s network to $44 million monthly transacting actives as of December for growth of 22% year-over-year. Our active base is highly engaged, and we've seen growing adoption of Cash Card, which reached more than $13 million monthly actives as of December, a 31% attach rate to our monthly active base, up from a 22% attach rate two years ago. As we've grown our overall base of customers, we've also seen growing usage per cash card customer. In the fourth quarter spend per Cash Card active increased year-over-year as active used Cash Card for a diverse range of everyday purchases from fast food restaurants to big box retailers, to gas stations, and more. This broad reach has allowed Cash Card to gain meaningful scale generating nearly $0.5 billion in gross profit in 2021 up nearly two times compared to the prior year. As we look at the, the overall Cash App ecosystem inflows or the amount of money customers pulled into their Cash App accounts totaled $45 billion in the fourth quarter, which grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, even as most government disbursement programs ended by September. This represented more than $1,000 per monthly transacting active, which was relatively stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis and increased year-over-year. As actives adopt more products, they typically inflow more money into Cash App, which we've seen leads a greater monetization. You can see the power of this dynamic with Cash Card customers. In the fourth quarter Cash Card actives generated approximately five times more gross profit per active as compared to actives that only used peer-to-peer. Turning now our Square ecosystem, Square generated gross profit of $657 million in the fourth quarter, up 54% year-over-year or 32% on a two-year CAGR basis, an improvement from the third quarter. Our strategic priorities are building omnichannel products, growing up markets and expanding globally, continue to drive growth Our upmarket sellers have achieved strong growth, kind of adopted more products over time. Square gross profit from mid-market sellers grew significantly faster than the overall Square business up 73% year-over-year in the fourth quarter or 47% on a two-year CAGR basis. We continue to believe our Square ecosystem is differentiated due to our integrated and cohesive set of products across the hardware, software, payments and financial services, serving seller needs in a more comprehensive way. We are making progress in surfacing incremental product adoption to serve our sellers across multiple vectors, with a goal of creating a more retentive and valuable relationship. As our mix has shifted to larger and more complex sellers, we've seen an increase in product adoption. In 2021 80% of Square gross profit came from sellers using two or more products and 38% came from sellers using four or more products. With these sellers generating more than 10 times the gross profit compared to those only using one product. Our Square ecosystem has also resonated across our global markets. Gross profit from Square's markets outside the U.S. grew faster than the overall pace of 60% year-over-year and 63% on a two-year taker CAGR basis in the fourth quarter. Despite various periodic lockdowns as we continue to achieve strong acquisition of new sellers and increased product parody with the U.S. market. Now shifting to the strong cohort economics that have enabled efficient growth for our cash and Square ecosystem starting with Cash App acquisition, retention and returns on investment. In 2021 even as we scaled our marketing investments, Cash App spends approximately $10 to acquire a new transacting active, and we've seen early monthly cohort maintaining a payback period of less than one-year as gross profit per monthly active with $47 in the fourth quarter. For existing customers increased product adoption and engagement has enabled annual gross profit retention of more than 125% each of the last of the past four years, which has driven strong returns on investment of 6 times or greater over three years for historical cohorts. Square has also driven attractive cohort economics. In 2021 Square again on-boarded its largest annual cohort of new sellers on a gross profit basis with a greater mix of investment towards long-term strategic areas like international and brand campaign, Square's 2021 sales and marketing spend is pacing towards an estimated six-quarter payback. Beyond growth in new seller acquisition we saw encouraging recovery within our existing days this year. Each of our existing annual cohorts achieved positive gross profit retention in 2021 compared to 2019, aggregate grew 10% over this period. Square's 2020 and 2020 cohorts are pacing towards compelling returns on investment of 3x over four years. With these cohort economics, we delivered incremental adjusted EBITDA margins of 32% in 2021, which was driven by ramping profitability in both Square and Cash App and illustrates the potential structural profitability in our business that we're investing behind. Next an update on Afterpay, we completed the acquisition of Afterpay on January 31st, 2022. Since we announced the transaction in early August, our teams have been focused on closing the transaction and planning for the sizable integration of our two companies. Despite the significant work in management focus required on day one, we executed on a meaningful integration of our square into our Square ecosystem. We're excited about the early progress and also recognize we're embarking on a multiyear effort to deliver the shared vision we have for our customers. Although Afterpay did not contribute to our fourth quarter results, we wanted to share trends on Afterpay's business since their last reported financial results. Looking first at Afterpay's growth drivers in the second half of 2021, Gross Merchandise Volume or GMV was up 54% year-over-year and up 84% on a two-year CAGR basis. Revenue and gross profit each grew by approximately 53% year-over-year and by approximately 73% on a two-year CAGR basis. Afterpay continued to grow acquisition across its merchant and consumer base in the second half of 2021. At the end of December, Afterpay had more than 122,000 annual active merchants, up 64% year-over-year and more than 19 million annual active consumers, up 47% year-over-year. As we look towards integration, we see a powerful opportunity to expand and reinforce both our seller and consumer relationships by connecting Afterpay with our Square and Cash App ecosystems. Turning to Afterpay's consumer losses in the second half of 2021, an area that Afterpay has been deliberate in managing. Losses on consumer receivables were 1.17% of GMV, an increase of 8 basis points compared to the first half of 2021 driven by seasonality around holidays and a greater mix of volumes from newer products and regions. We have historically seen loss rates improve with more time after we launch in the market as customers transact more frequently and our data model become more robust. We have seen this trend in our older markets of Australia and New Zealand, and North America and the United Kingdom are following a similar path for our core Buy Now Pay Later product. We saw healthy consumer repayment behavior as 98% of installments were paid on time in the second half of 2021, consistent with the first half of 2021. On a full year 2021 basis, Afterpay delivered $19.7 billion in GMV, up 74% year-over-year. Revenue growth was approximately 71% year-over-year, and gross profit growth was approximately 75% year-over-year. Finally, turning to trends in the first quarter and our expected investments. Similar to prior years, we wanted to provide – prior quarters, we wanted to provide an update on trends so far in the quarter. Excluding Afterpay across Cash App and Square, we expect gross profit growth of 33% year-over-year or 43% on a two-year CAGR through January and February. By ecosystem, for Cash App for the month of January and February, we expect gross profit growth of 21% year-over-year or 71% on a two-year CAGR basis. For Square for the month of January and February, we expect gross profit growth of 45% year-over-year or 28% on a two-year CAGR basis. We experienced a moderation in gross profit growth for both our Cash App and Square ecosystems in January before growth improved in February. We believe the moderation in January growth was driven in part by the impact of the Omicron variant as both businesses were more impacted in regions with pronounced increases in COVID cases. While Cash App got impacts in January network volumes across peer-to-peer and Cash for Business. Cash Card continued to deliver strong growth year-over-year and on a two-year CAGR basis. Square GPV growth was more impacted in verticals like food and drink, retail and beauty, which saw a trough in mid-January before improving in the subsequent weeks. In February, we have seen trends in each ecosystem improve compared to January. Through the first three weeks of February, Square GPV growth on a two-year CAGR basis was approximately at fourth quarter levels. For Cash App, we expect gross profit to increase month-over-month in February compared to January as inflows through the first three weeks of February are trending ahead of January level and back near December levels. We completed the acquisition of Afterpay at the end of January, so Afterpay will only contribute to February and March results in the first quarter. For the month of February, we expect Afterpay GMV growth to be between 25% and 30% year-over-year, with revenue growth in a similar range. Now looking ahead with the remainder of the first quarter. In the first quarter, we expect the gross profit two-year CAGR for both Cash App and Square to modestly improve compared to trends through January and February, driven by an expected improvement in the two-year CAGR in March. On a year-over-year basis, we expect slower growth in March compared to January and February as the prior year comps get tougher. Recall that we benefited from a strong growth in March 2021 behind government disbursements during that month. As we look ahead to 2022, beyond the first quarter, we believe Cash App's year-over-year gross profit growth rate will improve in the second half of the year compared to the first half as the comps become more favorable and as we introduce new product innovations across our commerce and financial services priorities and make pricing adjustments in certain areas. As we look at 2022, we expect to sequentially grow gross profit each quarter across Cash App and Square throughout the year, assuming the macroeconomic environment remains stable. Moving to our planned investments for the first quarter and full year 2021. For the first quarter, we expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $180 million compared to the fourth quarter or $40 million when excluding Afterpay. For the full year 2022, we expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $2.3 billion including Afterpay's expected operating expense base of approximately $1 million this year. Excluding Afterpay, we expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $1.3 billion or approximately 38% growth year-over-year, which is consistent with what we shared in November. Given the pacing of our investments during the year, we expect to deliver greater adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of the year. We expect that our four emerging initiatives: TIDAL, TBD, the hardware wallet and Bitcoin mining; will represent approximately $140 million in non-GAAP operating expenses or 2% to 3% of the overall company's investments. As always, we will actively manage our investments, adjusting based on the top line growth and returns we see. At our upcoming Investor Day on May 18, we are excited to share more with you about where we are and where we're headed. We see a compelling long-term vision, a large and growing total addressable market, pressing customer needs that we'll continue to focus on and strong unit economics in our business. We hope to tell you more about the potential with Afterpay and how we will work to connect our growing Square and Cash App ecosystems. In the meantime, we will be disciplined and adapt in this dynamic environment as ever. I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the incremental margin comments, it's really encouraging. I thought I'd ask, if you don't mind, just on the operating expense investments. And I mean, you talked about – over 50% last year, you spent another $1.3 billion, like you said back in November this year. So, I'm curious, have your investment priorities or visibility in spending changed in any way with respect to getting adequate returns that you've been talking about? I thought that the CAC on Cash App is now $10. So just curious if your priorities or your general thinking here has changed, whether it be growing users or ARPU or just spending priorities? Thank you. Sure, Tien-Tsin. Thanks for the question. So first, let me say what we delivered in 2021 in terms of our adjusted EBITDA margins of 32% year-over-year versus 2020 really showed the ramping profitability and underlying structural profitability potential across our businesses, across both Square and Cash App. And that's what we're investing behind here. Now that, coupled with the unit economics is what we look at on a dynamic basis throughout the year to assess the investments that we're making. And I think it's important for us to unpack that a little bit to look at the quality of these cohort economics to understand the investments that we're making. With Cash App specifically, I think there are four factors that we look at. And each of those four factors that I'll go through has attractive fundamentals, and they've traced over time. So first, customer acquisition; Cash App's strong network effect has driven efficient acquisition historically. But even as we've scaled our investment in the past year with paid marketing to target new audiences that help us drive both brand awareness and engagement with higher product adoption and ultimately ARPU, even with that incremental marketing investment, we increased our CAC to only $10 to acquire a net new active customer in 2021 versus the historic $5, which frankly, you could argue is too efficient. We believe this is lower. That $10 is still lower than other neobanks and a fraction of what a traditional bank would spend to acquire a new customer, and that's really supported by the efficiency of the model with peer-to-peer embedded within the app. Then you look at the returns on the investment here with Cash App. Our focus in these investments is measuring returns on investment because we've seen growing ARPU over time. And what we've achieved historically is an ROI of over six times over three years for historical cohorts. And even again in 2021, as we increased marketing spend by 3x and CAC by over 2x, we've seen our early 2021 cohort trend towards a payback of less than one year. And we on-boarded our largest annual cohort on both variable profit and gross profit basis here in 2021. Then you look at engagement, and to your point, ARPU. Gross profit per monthly active was $47 based on fourth quarter gross profit, which increased 13% from the prior year, showing increasing engagement of our customers over time. And we believe we're still early in this cross-sell journey, especially when you think about the power of a product like Cash Card, which is still at only just over a 30% attach rate to our total active base and Cash Card really driving more inflows and more spend and more engagement on the platform. So, we see a meaningful opportunity here to grow ARPU, both with products like Cash Card and with other products like investing, direct deposit, et cetera. And that's a meaningful focus for us as part of our go-to-market strategy to drive ARPU. And then finally, retention. We increased engagement and monetization for our customers over time, and that's led to strong gross profit retention of over 125% year-over-year in each of the last four years. That means once the cohort onboards; on average they generated at least 25% more gross profit in their second year and at least 25% more in the third and fourth years, net of any churn. So, these are the dynamics that we're investing behind in our key focus areas, which really haven't changed given the health of these fundamental metrics that we're looking at as we make these investments. That was good though. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please ask your question. All right. Thanks guys. A nice job on the results. Maybe just a bit of a follow-up, it's obviously great to hear the strong trends in January and February, especially around the Cash App gross profit. When we look at the conviction in your Cash App organic growth potential from here, it sounded constructive at the acceleration you're talking about in the second half. Perhaps if you could just give us more color on expectations for active user growth relative to the 4 million to 5 million semiannual adds you've had before versus that ARPU. And then just, Jack, maybe you can give us some more understanding you pate building out in terms of new products that can drive that ARPU and engagement that either we've seen so far, expanding more or yet to come and what do you have in mind? Thanks guys. Thanks, Darrin. Jack, maybe I can start, and then you can take the second part of the question? So just to ground you in what we're seeing so far for Cash App, Darrin, is gross profit growth ultimately driven by, as you called out network reach engagement and inflows, which we shared at $45 billion in Q4 was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. When we unpack a little bit of what we've seen so far this year, in January, we did see some moderation in the gross profit growth rate for Cash App, which we believe was related in part to Omicron. We saw resilience though in certain parts of the ecosystem, for instance, Cash Card, which is more resilient and continue to drive strong growth. In February, we expect gross profit to increase month-over-month as inflows in those first three weeks of February are trending ahead of January levels nearly back to December levels. We also expect year-over-year gross profit growth to improve in February. And when you look throughout the rest of the quarter, we expect that two-year CAGR to modestly improve for Cash App from the 71% we had in January, February, based on an expected improvement in March. And again would anchor you to the two-year CAGR here for Q1 just given the comps around the year-over-year from March of 2021 last year with the government disbursement. Looking to the remainder of 2022, as we think about growth levers, we see room to scale with recent product launches, with Cash App Pay, Families, Taxes, which are still early in scaling in the second quarter. And obviously, we've got the pipeline around Cash App Borrow and integration products with Afterpay and with the commerce opportunity there. So as a result, as you noted, we expect Cash App year-over-year gross profit growth rate to improve in the second half versus the first half behind these new products behind some pricing changes and as we begin lapping a more normalized macro environment in the second half of the year. And Darrin, I think your question was around just new products for Cash App. The strongest and greatest thing about Cash App that we found is how it creates network effects. We started with that early on. So, if you look at how we launched the app, the peer-to-peer aspect has always been our strongest driver of usage. So, me being able to get paid and then also request money from my friends or send money for my friends, creating another account and another customer. But as we look forward, some of the features that Amrita mentioned also have the benefit of enhancing those network effects. So, any product that either creates new network effects or strengthens the one where we already have, we're going to look to see [indiscernible] (0:29:45). We have a lot today that, I think, positively reinforce one another. And a lot of it creates even more opportunity for people to keep their money with us. And as we see people keeping their money with us, we see them getting more activities that we offer such as Bitcoin or stocks or the Cash Card or obviously, Direct Deposit, Taxes are part of that. So, there's a whole suite of financial tools that Cash App has access to that we're really excited about. And we'll do it in a way that we've always done it, make sure that we get down to the simplest bare essentials that people can use immediately. And I think that's what sets us apart from our competitors and especially the neobanks and some of the others that you all have brought up is that. We're not just focused on one aspect, as you have an entire ecosystem that possibly reinforces one another for our customer customers and do that for us as well. And then you bring in the Square side, the seller side, I think the most exciting thing for us going forward is how we connect these two ecosystems even more. And Afterpay is one such example of a massive connection that we're really excited about. We're excited to be finally past the integration, so we can focus on building, especially on the Cash App side. You've only seen the Square Seller side, but we did this as a connection between the two, and we're super excited about what it brings to Cash App customers. Thanks, gentlemen. For our third question, we have Karen Cabelas, a Cash App customer. Please as your question. Yes. Hi. Thank you again. I definitely enjoy using Cash App and the question that I have, I normally receive my paycheck direct deposited into Cash App. And while I do enjoy receiving my checks two days earlier, I just wanted to know down the line on your guys' road map, do you see my paycheck being Cashed App into – converted into Bitcoin down the line? Yes. I can take that. Thank you, first and foremost, for being a customer. Obviously, we're really excited about Bitcoin. We wanted to make it more accessible to everyone. I love your interest about automatically converting your paycheck into Bitcoin as well. We're seeing a lot of – and we're partnering with a lot of athletes to do exactly this. Obviously, we want to bring it to everyone. You can do it today effectively by direct depositing the Cash App and then doing an auto buy on the Bitcoin tab, so you can effectively set a Cash App to buy the coin for you every week or two weeks or whatever time period you want from your direct deposit, your paycheck. But we think there's opportunities to make that even more seamless. So, we're definitely looking at that and thank you so much. Thank you again for the opportunity. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Great. Thanks everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Cash App Taxes, given the inflows are right around the corner here over the next few weeks. Really, I think about this as two types of benefits. There's near-term and long-term. On the near-term, you have obviously the tax refund inflows and monetization. And then longer term, it's sort of a shot on goal to bring on more users, to reduce churn, more Cash Card, more Direct Deposit, et cetera. Maybe you could just help talk about both of those, both the near-term and the long-term and how it might play out? Yes. I mean I think that's a great way to think about it. Certainly, we definitely see a lot of opportunities in the near term to look at the customers using Cash App already today for core taxes through direct deposit. But ideally, we want to be known as the simplest way to handle all of your personal finances. No matter what you have to do, no matter how creative they become, we want to make sure it's simple and straightforward. And that was the idea behind creating and launching Cash App Taxes. And we think there's a long road map ahead that is very fulfilling for our customers and also for us definitely over the long-term. We still see a lot of complications in taxes and filing taxes, a lot of hidden costs that are unnecessary that we can take away. And we're going to follow our history and remove any insecurity of information that we've seen in the financial industry, get it closer to customers, which has them – that we see has been using our services a lot more because it's much more transparent and easier. So, we're really excited about this as a platform. But more importantly, we're excited to remove one of its complexities so that people can get on with their lives. And Tim, I'll just add that what we see with our tax product is we want customers to view Cash App as really a preferred banking platform and expand awareness around Cash App's Direct Deposit capabilities. As Jack mentioned, historically, we see more inflows around tax season, customers bringing in their tax refunds to Cash App. But now with this integrated tax product, we can make those deposits even easier and faster. Customers using Cash App Taxes can receive their refund up to two days early, if it's deposited to Cash App, which we believe can drive more inflows in the Cash App. And ultimately, our focus as we level up is on driving more inflows, obviously, through adding that utility to our customers. And we believe Cash App Taxes can act as both an acquisition and an engagement product for Cash App by being that simplified free tax tool. I would note that there's a number of levers that we have, right, for driving inflows. And one of them around recurring paycheck deposits, we are also seeing traction on. We've seen growth in recurring paycheck deposits with volumes up 2 times year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we've made improvements to that direct deposit experience by allowing customers to directly log into their employer or their payroll provider from the app and also as we invest in marketing and boost incentives to drive awareness of those products and features. So, part of a broader strategy that we have around ultimately the utility to our customers and inflows into Cash App. Excellent. Yes. We noted that partnership with Pinwheel there, so thank you for both of those updates, Jack and Amrita. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please ask your question. Terrific. Thanks guys. Now that the Afterpay acquisition has closed and you've had a few months working with that team, can you just provide an updated perspective on the primary sources of synergies from the deal and how you expect the synergies to maybe even start to affect Block in 2022? Thank you. Yes. So first, we're thrilled to be over the hump and finally closed. As you all can imagine, integrations are quite challenging and distracting for both Afterpay, Square and Cash App with – we knew going into this, but we believe in the outcome fully and the future of it. This is a huge connection between our two largest ecosystems, Square and Cash App. On the Square side, this is something that our customers have been asking for, for quite some time. Both for themselves as sellers, but also for their customers. Their customers are driving some of this adoption. The interest thing about after pay is it gets us much closer to much, much larger retailers continuing to go down our omnichannel strategy, making sure that we are meeting our customers wherever they are, whatever size merchants that they want to shop in. For Cash App, there's a long roadmap ahead. We haven't seen much of this. We'll talk more about this during our Investor Day. But this is to me where a lot of the real excitement lies, is now we have an opportunity for a whole lot more discovery on the Cash App side and giving Cash App customers entirely new capabilities that haven't had certainly a Cash App before, but I don't think in any financial instruments. So, we're still happy to be through this integration. It was tough and challenging. But I'm really proud of the fact that we're able to launch something day one of course and then customers could use it right away. So, expect us to continue that momentum and continue to push and expect a lot more on the Cash App side. And I’ll just add Lisa, obviously we've only just completed the acquisition a few weeks ago. So, we'll have more to share about how we expect to unlock deeper integration points and synergies between the businesses Jack said in Investor Day, but we really see a meaningful cross-sell opportunity between our Square sellers, Afterpay customers, both merchants and consumers and Cash App and plan to leverage that overlap in consumption behavior as we develop these integration points further. Just to dig in a little bit more on the Cash App side, Afterpay’s retailers have shown a lot of excitement about a potential integration opportunity being developed right now with Cash App including the combination of ‘buy now, pay later’ with Cash App Pay, which we just launched a few months ago. We've also built-in Cash App, in an initial search page for customers where they can discover ‘buy now, pay later’ offers within Cash App, similar to how you might discover a boost offer within your Cash App. Customers can click through the search icon to discover Afterpay merchants along with other peer-to-peer network and boost functionality. That's the first time we've enabled commerce for customers to buy through Cash App. And it's early days, we continue to iterate beyond on this product, but we've already seen, over a hundred thousand leads out from Cash App to Afterpay merchants since late December when we enabled this. So, this is something that we think will continue to evolve and become more and more prominent as we further integrate Afterpay offers into Cash App, as well as further integration, obviously into Square broadening out the rollout of ‘buy now, pay later’ to include some sellers. And we look forward to updating you more as we make progress. Exciting. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please ask your question. Thank you for taking my question. So, I want to ask about affluent user expansion for Cash App, driving monetization for affluent users is needed where some of your peers like Venmo have struggled, partly because these individuals were relatively well served by traditional financial institutions. So, as you increase your marketing spend on Cash App, which I recognize is still very low on a cash basis, what are you seeing in terms of engagement and user behavior for active consumers? Thank you. Well, I'll say that, I think, our biggest constraint right now is just how we think about building Cash App’s risk and compliance efforts everything that we see around fraud. We want to make sure that we are building a system that is scalable, that allows for limits for customers who might have more resources at their disposal and want to use Cash App for more and more things such as – as they would treat their normal bank. So, we have we have limits in place to manage all these things. And a big goal for us is to make sure that we're looking for opportunities to increase those and to at the same time maintain all the risk controls, and fraud, and continue to do what we've done so well over the years. Not just on the Cash App side, but on the Square side, this has been our business forever. So, as we look at inflows and deposits especially this is a huge opportunity for us especially for our higher net worth individuals who want to use the Cash App. The marketing, I think, generally appeals to a very broad base mainstream and that is always going to be our intention. We want to make sure we're building a brand that number one people can trust. So, they see it as simple, they see it as solid trustworthy, and that matches their experience when they download the app, they get in, everything works immediately, they can access all the features that there's very, very simple ways to provide more information to get higher limits in place. So, I think the marketing, as we continue to look for opportunities to go even more mainstream and to reach a stronger audience. Our marketing will certainly reflect the uniqueness of the brand, which has served us really, really well. Especially when you consider the competition that we have in other banking services and how dry and somewhat boring now in comparison. So, we're very excited to bring a lot more life to this, and certainly a lot more trust and a lot more fairness for our customers as well, which is a big part of why we're doing what we're doing. Great. And Harshita I'd just add to underscore Jack's point Cash App at $44 million monthly active, growing 22% year-over-year was a number one downloaded finance app in the U.S. in 2021, and the number four downloaded app overall in the U.S. in 2021 on iOS. So, we are reaching mainstream scale and want to continue to enable broad-based utility as Jack was saying around deposits and limits. But as we see through the strengths of our cohort economics with rowing ARPU, $47 in the fourth quarter up 13% year-over-year with strong gross profit retention of over 125% year-over-year for each of the last four years, and with strong ROI’s success over the last three years. And now with four monetization streams at $200 million or more in gross profit, there is a diversity of customers that we're reaching and a diversity of use cases that we're helping to address for our customer base. And that work continues. And with that work we believe we'll be able to reach greater diversity of demographics and use cases over time. Very helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc Cap Markets. Please ask your question. Thank you so much taking the questions. I wanted to go back a little bit to this topic of commerce discovery. Certainly, the 100,000 leads right out of the gate is impressive. And Afterpay had certainly really good momentum on building out this affiliate model. So, I'm just curious, as you play this forward, how do you see this evolving? Is it maybe a case where you start to build out adtech capabilities and have much deeper conversations with the advertising community to really kind of monetize some of the commerce discovery aspects of the platform? Just curious strategically how you're approaching that. Sure, I can jump in here. What we see with the combination of Afterpay in both of Cash and Square is a true differentiator, frankly, when you look at the landscape of commerce and financial services and specifically differentiator related to buy now, pay later as we connect and integrate these platforms. Specifically with Cash and Afterpay, we see strong potential to deepen the engagement across millions of younger consumers, frankly, who are immersed in online and omnichannel commerce. Longer term, we also see an opportunity to bring Cash App's financial tools, including money transfer, stock bitcoin, Boost, et cetera, to Afterpay customers as well. So, we see that crossover across financial services. But specifically with commerce, as you noted, Afterpay has a history of being able to drive lead generation to merchants because prior to the acquisition, they were driving over a million leads per day in the back half of 2021 with 38% of those referrals from consumers searching within Afterpay for specific brands and 46% of referrals from browsing on Afterpay's at homepage. And now when you combine that with the scale of cash asset, 44 million monthly actives, that's an even greater opportunity for us to really add value both to the merchants who are looking for more quality consumers and to the consumer who are looking for more opportunities and more offers. So, we see a significant opportunity there. The other thing that I'd say is that when you think about the integration with Square, obviously, we've launched the Square Online integration. Day 1 was encouraging early results. But we've got a much more fulsome further rollout to come across the broader ecosystem of in-person and online in coming months. And what we've seen with Afterpay is the growing importance of their omnichannel presence. And there were mature markets like Australia and New Zealand in December, they drove over 30% of their GMV in-store. And those omnichannel consumers transact four times more compared to online-only consumers. And we saw that in both the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand last year. So really, the integration across both sides of the ecosystem for consumers in both merchants, we see as a tremendous future opportunity. Very exciting. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Please ask your question. Thank you. Good evening. Jack, I want to touch upon your networking comment you made earlier. I could tell you that, certainly at my son's school, Cash App for teens is definitely buzzworthy, particularly among you think about everyone's favorite bank, Bank of Mom and Dad, who also need to download the app. Just wondering if you've seen that early signs of that networking effect as it relates to Cash App for teens. And then a quick follow-up, Amrita, I just wondering if you could just give some color on the success of user migration from Karma to Cash App. I know that the Karma app has been directing users to download Cash App. Just wondering how are you viewing that progress? And how do you figure that into CAC? Thank you. Yes. So, to answer your question, yes, we have seen encouraging adoption by teens joining our platform and really strong demand for the broader ecosystem, especially Cash App. I do think the – I think the marketing applies – I think the marketing like really speaks to this group of people. It speaks to you, but the simplicity and the control speaks to the parents as well. So, I think we've found a really good mix, and we see a very long road map ahead for that initiative for teens and for families and friends. So, we're definitely excited about that and bringing more of our – of the ecosystem to it as well. Amrita? Yes. Pete, just to finish up on that first point with Cash App for families, 20 million teens in the U.S. today represent a large portion of spend in coming years. And we know they're early on in their financial journey, we can grow with them, and they're typically – teens are typically underserved by traditional financial services, obviously relying mostly on cash. So, this is an opportunity, to your point to drive network effects as well as to grow with next-gen consumers. The second part of your question, I think, you are referring to Credit Karma CAC and our ability to – now that we have an integrated Cash App Taxes product to bring on new customers. Is that – was that your question, Pete? Yes, yes. Yes, certainly, we do see an opportunity both from an engagement standpoint with our current customers who are looking for a free and relatively simple tax filing service. We're seeing an opportunity to go deeper with them to provide that utility around our integrated tax product and making those deposits easier. So, it's an integration – sorry, an engagement opportunity for us as we've integrated. It is also an acquisition opportunity for us. It is also an opportunity to bring new people in the Cash App who maybe haven't tried some of the other offerings within Cash App. But as they learn more about Cash App through Cash App Taxes, we have the opportunity to make them aware of our other products and services across the ecosystem. It's still early for us. We're still relatively early in the tax season, and we're still in year 1 in terms of this integrated product, but we're encouraged by the early results that we're seeing here. That’s good to hear. Thank you both. [Operator Instructions] Our last question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please – please ask your question. Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. I was wondering if, Jack and Amrita, you could give us your updated thoughts on the road map to roll out Cash App in more international market. I'm trying to think of what the value proposition might look like internationally relative to the U.S. and sort of the timing around when we might see an expansion of Cash App in other geographies. Yes. So, this remains a major focus for the team. We intended the Square business to be global and the intent for the Cash App business to be equal as well. We have made some moves here. But the biggest strategies that we're exploring today for expansion is, number one, with our products. We launched the ability to send funds between the U.S. and UK and have seen steady growth for the UK customers in transaction frequency over the past year. And the second is through M&A. We recently acquired Borsa, which is a European financial mobile app based out of Spain, where we've been learning more about peer-to-peer behavior in Europe. And this will definitely be an opportunity for us to learn about how we move next around the world. So, we will both continue to expand our products globally and take the right product features to launch for and then also look for opportunities to make acquisitions within markets that have similar behaviors or attributes that we have found to be valuable in Cash App. And Ramsey, I'd just add that this is another one where Afterpay certainly comes into play. When you think about that 19 million consumer base as of the end of last year, about 65% is in the U.S., but obviously, a significant portion that sits outside of the United States where we can grow together from a consumer standpoint and certainly, as you think about Australia, where there's a significant opportunity to leverage the flag that Afterpay has already planted so well for Cash App. So, we see an opportunity for the future here as we build upon the skill sets and the footprint and the consumer base that Afterpay brings into Block. Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for participating. This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.","we will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions .

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Sir. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of April. These represent our current estimate for April performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of April and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual April results may differ from these estimates.
Also we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the Shareholder Letter of our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. We're looking forward to spending time with you all at our Investor Day on May 18, where we'll be able to share everything we're doing across Block and how it all connects together.
I'm going to start with a few highlights across our business from the quarter. Cash App made a lot of progress in four areas this quarter: Cash App for Families, Trust, Afterpay and Bitcoin. We continue to make it easier for customers to bring their families into the Cash App ecosystem with simple and safe controls. Introducing FDIC insurance in April on all accounts with the Cash App card builds trust and encourages people to maintain a balance and fulfills a long-standing customer request.
And we're just getting started integrating Afterpay into Cash App where we've already seen Cash App actives drive more than 35000 leads to Afterpay sellers during the first quarter. We continue to make Bitcoin more accessible through Cash App. More than 10 million accounts have bought Bitcoin since we've started offering the service. In last month, we announced the ability to send and receive Bitcoin through the Lightning network.
Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain can take as long as 10 minutes to settle, making it unusable for everyday small transactions. Lightning fixes that making transactions instant and free through the Cash App. The Cash App team built this functionality using the Lightning development kit built by Spiral, the open source initiative we fund to help build the Bitcoin ecosystem. The team evaluated all other options available and ultimately chose Spiral's LDK since it reduced years of work into just a few months to get the feature to our customers.
We also announced that anyone with an active Cash App card can automatically invest a percentage of their paychecks into Bitcoin with no transaction fees. We believe steps like these increase the usability of Bitcoin all towards an open global monetary transmission network the world can trust. For us, we believe it increases the probability and velocity of serving a more global customer base.
Turning to our original ecosystem Square. We continue to build tools and services to help sellers make more sales. In April, we introduced the new Square Stand across all of our markets updated with modernized hardware, integrated payments with no need for a separate card reader and a redesigned checkout flow that provides sellers and their customers with a more intuitive and streamlined experience.
Since we introduced the first Square Stand in 2009, it helped sellers large and small run their entire business from a single place from in-person payments to managing online sales, deliveries and in-store orders. With the new Square Stand, we're offering sellers our most affordable countertop product to-date and a commerce experience that has been updated from the ground up to reflect how sellers do business today.
Another way we are strengthening the Square ecosystem, is with Afterpay's Buy Now Pay Later service. This quarter we integrated this feature to help online sellers of all sizes better compete. In the months, since introducing Buy Now Pay Later online thousands of Square sellers have used and processed sales with Afterpay. This integration grew Afterpay seller base by an additional 10% in the quarter and as of today more than 20,000 Square sellers have processed an Afterpay transaction. We plan to make Buy Now Pay Later available for in-person payment soon as well. As we've talked with you all in the past calls, we believe the connections between our ecosystems like Square and Cash App are what set us apart and makes it so valuable to our customers. Afterpay is a great example of this and we have many more to come. We'll share more about this at our Investor Day.
With that here's Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are three topics, I'd like to cover today. First, a look at our performance in the first quarter of 2022; second an update on our business through April; and third a look at our investments for the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, our ecosystems delivered impressive growth with gross profit of $1.3 billion up 34% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $195 million. In February and March, Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit. Excluding this gross profit for the quarter was $1.2 billion up 25% on a year-over-year basis and 45% on a three-year CAGR basis.
Before getting into the results in our ecosystems, I wanted to address how Afterpay will flow through our financial results for Square and Cash App. Given we're integrating Afterpay into both our Square and Cash App ecosystems and expect it to benefit the growth of each, we've decided to allocate 50% of Afterpay revenue and gross profit to each of Square and Cash App. We recognize Afterpay revenue and gross profit in our subscription and services-based revenue line and not in GPV or transaction profit.
Cash App generated $624 million of gross profit in the first quarter, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 94% on a three-year CAGR basis. Excluding $46 million of gross profit from Afterpay Cash App gross profit was $578 million up 17% year-over-year and 90% on a three-year CAGR basis.
Let's talk about some of the drivers. First, we saw our strongest monthly engagement on Cash App in March as monthly actives transacted 21 times on average across our ecosystem during the month. This is driven by strong adoption of our banking products including Cash App card. Cash App Card was one of our fastest-growing monetization streams, with gross profit growth in the first quarter of more than 50% year-over-year despite strong growth in the prior year period and more than 170% growth on a three-year CAGR basis.
Second, we saw our highest quarterly inflows ever into Cash App with growth on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Inflows per active declined slightly on a year-over-year basis given significant government disbursements in the prior year period but increased quarter-over-quarter. Direct deposit has been a growing mix of inflows and we've seen particular strength from recurring paycheck deposits, which were up more than 2.5 times year-over-year in March.
Increased adoption has been a key driver of volume here. In March, we reached approximately 1.5 million direct deposit monthly actives. And while we've been increasing adoption across our monthly active base, we believe there is still so much opportunity ahead as we bring awareness to our direct deposit capabilities.
Square generated $661 million of gross profit, an increase of 41% year-over-year and 30% on a three-year CAGR basis. Excluding Afterpay, Square gross profit was $615 million up 31% year-over-year and 27% on a three-year CAGR basis. A few factors regarding Square's performance. First, we continue to grow upmarket and gain share among mid-market sellers. Gross profit from the mid-market segments was up 47% year-over-year outpacing total Square gross profit.
We've been encouraged by the adoption of our financial services products among mid-market sellers specifically with Square Savings. In the first quarter, mid-market sellers were twice as likely to fund their Square Savings accounts soon after opening it compared to the average seller. Our early traction shows that even larger sellers may be underserved by traditional financial institutions presenting an opportunity for Square to serve this segment with an integrated solution set.
Second, strengthening our presence in markets outside the US is a key part of our growth strategy. And in the first quarter, we improved product parity. In Canada, we launched Square Loans for sellers to expand access to credit and On-Demand Delivery, giving sellers an important omnichannel tool via third-party fulfillment options. We also added CRM tools in Ireland to help our sellers retain and engage customers. Including Afterpay gross profit in our markets outside the US represented 12% of Square's gross profit.
Next we wanted to share our recent trends. In April, we expect overall company gross profit growth of approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis including Afterpay. On a two-year CAGR basis, we expect growth to be relatively consistent with the first quarter's 48% three-year CAGR. The three-year CAGR helps normalize for the unusual growth comparisons during the pandemic.
For Cash App, in April, we expect gross profit excluding Afterpay to grow by more than 15% year-over-year or around 85% on a three-year CAGR basis. In April, cash flow saw -- Cash App saw healthy year-over-year growth in actives and overall inflows brought into the ecosystem. For Square, in April we expect gross profit excluding Afterpay to grow by more than 15% year-over-year and around 25% on a 3-year CAGR basis.
Square GPV is expected to be up 29% year-over-year in April. And on a three-year CAGR basis up 24% which is a slight improvement from 22% in the first quarter. As we have expected Square GPV grew faster than gross profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by two factors. First, we've seen a normalization in transaction-based gross profit margins as the mix of card not present and debit transactions roughly returned to 2019 levels; second, we are also closer to completing the PPP program with only 7% of loan applications yet to be forgiven.
We recognized $51 million of PPP revenue in gross profit in Q1 and we expect to recognize a much smaller amount across the remainder of 2022. With these impacts, we expect to see a delta between Square's gross profit growth and GPV growth on a year-over-year basis through the remainder of 2022. Although, we expect this delta to lessen in the coming quarters. Again the three-year CAGRs in April with gross profit at 25% growth and GPV at 24% growth were similar to one another and where I would orient you.
Turning to Afterpay. In April we expect GMV to be up 15% year-over-year or 70% on a three-year CAGR basis. And we expect revenue and gross profit growth to come in below this driven by a mix shift to newer markets. On a gross profit basis Afterpay's GAAP results are impacted by expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets which was a $9 million impact to cost of sales in the first quarter and is expected to be $12 million on a quarterly basis going forward. This is not an operational expense, but rather a GAAP purchase price accounting adjustment for the acquisition.
Losses on consumer receivables were 1.17% of GMV during the first quarter which was consistent with the second half of 2021. We continue to see healthy consumer repayment behavior with 95% of installments paid on time. We're focused on unlocking the combined potential with our integration. In addition to the launch of buy now pay later for Square online sellers, we see a broader opportunity to bring Afterpay to more of our Square ecosystem in the coming quarters.
On the Cash App side, we've been focused on bringing the demand generation capabilities of Afterpay to Cash App and are in the early days of building out a broader commerce platform. Our early experiments have sent 350,000 leads to Afterpay merchants as you heard from Jack. Our teams have been focused on a detailed integration road map which we'll share more about at Investor Day.
Turning now to trends for the remainder of the second quarter and full year. As we shared on our last earnings call we continue to believe Cash App's year-over-year gross profit growth rate excluding Afterpay will improve in the second half of the year compared to the first half, as comparisons become more favorable as we introduce new product innovations across our commerce and financial services priorities and with the benefit from pricing adjustments in certain areas.
Also, consistent with what we mentioned last quarter for the remainder of 2022 we expect Cash App and Square to sequentially grow gross profit each quarter throughout the year even excluding Afterpay, assuming the macroeconomic environment remains stable. Through April we have not yet seen a deterioration in overall consumer spending. That said, we're continuing to watch the broader macro environment.
Moving to our planned investments for the second quarter and full year 2022. For the second quarter, we expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $245 million compared to the first quarter or $180 million when excluding Afterpay. For the full quarter 2022, we expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $2.1 billion compared to 2021. This includes Afterpay's expected operating expense base of approximately $900 million this year. Excluding Afterpay, we expect to grow overall non-GAAP operating expenses by 35% year-over-year or $1.2 billion, which is similar to the step-up from 2020 to 2021.
As we shared in February, we expect to deliver greater adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of the year given the pacing of our investment during the year. We're excited to talk to you in more depth at our Investor Day on the 18th. There's a lot to update you on since our last Investor Day five years ago around our market opportunity, ecosystem, strategy and business model. We can't wait to share it with you.
With that we'll open it up to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks so much. Great to talk to all of you today [ph]. So I wanted to ask on Afterpay here and how it's performing versus your expectations. Any change in how you're investing in the asset for example now that you've owned it for a couple of months? I heard the consumer is still pretty stable from what you see but just curious how Afterpay itself is performing. Thanks. Yes. I'll start off with this. We're really excited about Afterpay and where it goes. We're still extremely early into this integration. This is the biggest thing our company has ever done. And obviously, it definitely distracts a lot but we've managed to perform through it. We do see a lot of our competitors taking advantage of the fact that we had this integration both by focusing on the fundamentals and the reason we acquired this company in the first place which is to connect these two ecosystems.
What sets us apart from every other company, whether they be focus on sellers, individuals, buy now pay later is we have all of it in one ecosystem. They all connect together. And by making those connections, by making those connections much stronger, we see a lot of power and a lot of value created for our customers both in the seller space and also the individual space.
So we have integrated Afterpay on the seller side. We're just starting to integrate on the Cash App side. And that's where I would point you all in the future is to really look at that because that for us really represents discovery. I said in my opening remarks I actually misstated. It wasn't 35,000 it's 350,000 leads from Cash App to Afterpay sellers and we expect that to continue to grow.
And we imagine as time goes on that Cash App will be one of the best ways to discover products, companies and businesses globally but also around you. So everything that we have both in the seller ecosystem and the Cash App ecosystem really comes to bear with this integration. And I'll fill in Tien-Tsin, a little bit on the near term. Jack spoke to the long-term transformational opportunity that we're going after. What we see in the near-term is yes, it is a competitive market. We are holding our ground. Our focus in the near-term is on managing to bringing on quality customers into our platform, deliberately managing our loss rates and driving increased consumer frequency. And we're seeing traction across each of those measures.
Afterpay from a customer perspective has a 144,000 merchants on their platform, which grew strongly year-over-year, 63% year-over-year – 68%, sorry year-over-year and over 20 million annual active consumers on the platform, which grew 37% year-over-year.
From a loss rate perspective, we're onboarding these consumers responsibly and maintaining discipline here, with a loss rate of 1.17% in the first quarter, consistent with what we had in the second half of last year and 95% of repayments being made on time. Obviously, as you manage the loss rates, there are some deliberate trade-offs you're making on growth, but we feel that that's the right thing to do in this environment.
And in terms of engaged consumers we're driving increased consumer frequency attracting consumers who want to spend more over time and have the ability to spend more over time. So that's what our focus is on the near term, as we build towards this longer-term commerce platform together, which we believe will be so transformational. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiodo from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please, go ahead, sir. Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking the question. Also, on the same similar theme around Cash App and the broader topic of commerce. So you mentioned this earlier, Jack, but we did notice that you did start integrating some of the Afterpay merchants into the Discover tab? And it sounds like you're sending folks over those Afterpay merchant sites. But maybe you could talk about what that shopping experience might evolve to over time in terms of maybe in-app purchasing or how Boost might be a part of that?
And as a follow-up, we noticed that in the Afterpay filings that you mentioned a degree of merchant funding for Boost at this point and maybe you could just give us an update on the portion of merchant funded versus Cash App funded? And related, just the percentage of overall Cash Card transactions that are boosted. I believe the last disclosure was around 5%-or-so. Thanks a lot. Yes. I believe this is -- the Discovery aspect is one of the critical reasons we made this acquisition and why we think it's so strategic for our overall business. It will enable the entire Cash App ecosystem all of our customers to discover products; sellers, both online and offline; Square sellers; and even merchants within their neighborhood very easily. And that lead generation is really important and we think it's something that can grow fairly massively.
It also, as you pointed out, complements what we already have built in with Boost, which is -- it's a rewards program on the Cash App front. So we think combining all these things, allowing for people for the first time ever in Cash App to explore all these products, all these merchants. And, of course, we want to make it as frictionless as possible. So you can imagine where that goes in terms of making that commerce very easy.
Everything, eventually, able to do right within the app, that would help bring the vehicle, because that means our sellers make more sales and our Cash App customers are happy because they're getting what they want instantly. And I'll add Tim that the combined pitch into merchants existing Afterpay sellers as well as potential new ones, on the strength of the consumer platform that we have the combined consumer scale that we have between Cash App and Afterpay is a really compelling one. Where we're really seeing some strong early interest is around the pitch of buy now pay later and Cash App Pay. And that's something again that we'll share more about at Investor Day.
And then, as you called out on Boost, we see an opportunity there. We're not actually funding Boost through Afterpay sellers today, but we see a meaningful opportunity there. Overall, we are seeing more partner funding through Boost, because we've been able to make the pitch about how consumers learn about a new merchant or increase their frequency at a new merchant, because of the Boost platform, which is a very compelling unique platform that's part of Cash App card. We haven't yet integrated the sales pitch on Afterpay, but that is something that we see, have a future strong potential on Boost as well, as what we're seeing on Cash App Pay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Hey. Thanks, guys. Your Cash App gross profit estimate result, I mean, even excluding Afterpay, you really handily beat our estimates. And I'm -- I mean hearing some of the metrics you guys threw out around engagement -- monthly engagement, I think, you said over 20 times per month or the debit card use, clearly, is driving a lot of that strength. And I know you're talking about sequential improvement as the year progresses from here.
So if we can just dive into that a little bit and understand what's driving that behavior -- consumer behavior with your products. What are they most excited about? Whether it's Cash App Taxes, or it's other new features that gives you that much confidence in it sustaining. Thanks again, guys. Sure. Thanks for the question, Darrin. I can lead off here. We have seen strong growth on Cash App. What you saw here in terms of the growth in the first quarter, as well as leading into April with 85% growth on a three-year CAGR basis greater than 15% year-over-year ex Afterpay continues to be very strong. I think a lot of it comes back to what we've shared around our inflow framework. These three key drivers of monetization win in Cash App.
First growing our active base. As of the end of December we had over 44 million monthly actives. We continue to grow that quarter-over-quarter in Q1 and month-over-month into April. Second inflows, we have continued to grow. We had our strongest inflow quarter ever in Q1. And that's on the back of growing product adoption as well as growing engagement as we noted in our remarks and as you noted strongest engagement month in March with 21 transactions during the month on average across our monthly base.
And then finally, the third variable around monetization rate. This is effectively how much we charge on the inflows that come into our system. And as you know, we've been able to drive value across the products that we have and been able to flex pricing on some of them even more recently. So that's the broader framework that really moves Cash App, where we've seen strong growth and traction even in the midst of a dynamic macro environment and strong health in the base of our customers on Cash App.
You also layer on top of that that we have some newer products that are just beginning to ramp whether it's reaching out to families whether it's driving inflows through direct deposits whether it's things like Cash App Pay or in the longer term the opportunities to build an integrated commerce platform with Afterpay, we see significant opportunity here to continue to drive growth through our Cash App platform. Thank you. Your next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to switch over to the Square business, looking at that international contribution that's up to 12% of GPV in the quarter. That's up, I think from 8% a year ago. You commented on some of the product rollouts in Canada and Ireland. Just taking a step back can you describe more broadly the international expansion strategy for Square? And what do you have to do sort of differently? Which countries are you prioritizing et cetera just so we can kind of get a sense for how much upside we can anticipate from the international side with Square? Thank you. Yeah, of course. So global expansion remains our top priority for Square and also for Cash App. And with Square with regard to Square, we have three approaches. Number one, we invest in brand and product awareness to drive a broader understanding of our product capabilities to sellers within each one of the markets. Number two, we focus on reaching product parity across all of our markets. And what this means is that, we have all the products that we have in the United States, ideally we're launching them everywhere in the markets that we're currently in as well. So that when Square loans is in one market, it's also in all the markets that we currently exist in.
So in Canada in Q1, we launched Square Loans to better help sellers manage their cash flow. And we also launched On-Demand Delivery. In Ireland in Q1, we launched Loyalty and Square Marketing. And as I said in my opening remarks in April, we launched our new Square Stand to all of our e-markets. And that is exactly what we want to do more of when we launch new features and new products they go to all of our markets.
We are also looking at new markets. So this is the third part of our strategy. In January, we expanded into Spain. And we brought buy now pay later functionality to Square sellers in Australia and the US. So invest in the brand and product awareness focus on making sure that all of our products exist in all of our markets, and then expand in new markets as well. That constitutes our strategy and we're pushing really hard as it is our top priority. Thank you. Your next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lending. So for traditional financial services, it's typically the gold mine for monetization but has been a tougher nut to crack by the real banks and fintechs. And I know you just launched the Borrow product. For some of the users you now have the Afterpay product. Can you talk about how important is lending in the context of your last ARPU expansion? Thank you. I'm happy to start here. I would say that we have always felt that fast access to funds, whether it's a customer's own funds or access to credit has been a key part of our platform and a key part of what our customers need in good times and in uncertain times. And we've built a lot of data, a lot of heuristics machine learning around the ability to enable customers for access to those funds in a responsible way. Obviously, we do that today on the Square platform with our Loans -- Square Loans product, which we were able to very quickly pause during the early days of the pandemic pivot to PPP and then relaunch. And now with originations there back to pre-pandemic levels with continued strong results, encouraging results we've seen with respect to loss rates and repayment rates.
As you noted Cash App Borrow is another aspect of a loan product or a credit product that we have been experimenting and ramping and one that we're also excited about for the future. But obviously we want to do that in a deliberate and responsible way. And then, of course, Afterpay receivables are another key piece. And as you heard earlier that's another one where we have seen loss rates consistent with historical ranges as we've onboarded things like soft credit checks and other means that really responsibly onboard quality customers.
And as we gather data across these platforms we have the ability to uniquely underwrite a lot of these customers whether consumers in the Cash App platform or sellers in the Square platform. So it's a key part of what we see our customers need and therefore an opportunity for us to as you know expand ARPU as an ecosystem product that helps our customers ultimately grow and eventually use other products within the platform as well. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good evening. Jack and Amrita you made a lot of references to a commerce platform bringing Afterpay into Cash App throughout the year. And it sounds like you have all the ingredients here to make it a pretty strong contextual commerce platform. In that vein, does Block see social as a potential component of the forward growth algorithm here? Thank you. Absolutely. I mean, payments is inherently social. There's a reason that Cash App remains in the top 10 of the app store every day. A lot of the benefit we get from customers and just the very model, the network effects built into it is the fact that someone wants to pay someone else and they send a Cash App request or actually send money and that person downloads the app. And that's just at the very, very base foundational layer.
We think there's a lot more. We think the Discovery tab that we have been talking about on this call with Afterpay is another step into it. We certainly think there's social networks within the seller side, the employee base of those sellers, obviously, within Cash App and also obviously within TIDAL, which is one of the reasons we acquired that company as well is to make sure that we are recognizing that payments is inherently something that people number one do at least weekly; and is a very social thing.
So we want to make sure that we are reflecting that in the app in the architecture and how we actually deliver the service to customers all around the world.
We're going to talk a lot about this at our Investor Day. And I'm really excited to see you all again on the 18th, because this is the first time in five years we've had a chance to really tell our story. And a lot has changed in those five years.
Our first Investor Day Cash App was barely mentioned. I don't think it even had a slide. So this is our opportunity to actually show you, how we've grown these ecosystems that we've not only proven we can grow one to massive scale but two.
And the real power in our model is how they connect and how we add new ecosystems that are serving even newer audiences and newer audience customer bases. So really excited to tell the story and can't wait to get into it, but absolutely we think the social layer is a really important part of what we do in the future. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the, Cash Card gross profit strength in the quarter. Was that largely driven by, transacting user growth or increased spend? And then, separately, could you just talk a little bit about the instant deposit trends in the quarter in your app? Thank you very much. Sure. Happy to jump in here, as you heard we've seen strong growth on Cash Card in the first quarter and into April. In the first quarter Cash Card grew 50% year-over-year 170% when you look on a three-year CAGR basis really astounding growth as customers find increased utility here.
As we've said in the past about, one in three of our monthly actives within Cash App use Cash Card each month. As of December, we had said about 13 million monthly actives. It's obviously continued to grow since then. And it's a part of our broader strategy in addressing customers from teams to their family members to the broader platform where we've found continued strong traction here.
And we have seen really broad-based utility, where customers are spending at big box retailers, discount retailers, restaurant, fast food, groceries, everyday expenses and that utility is ultimately what drives not only new actives into Cash Card but increased utility overtime on a weekly and daily basis.
We also see Cash Card as a product that builds attach to other products meaning that you're likely more likely to become a direct deposit active for instance if you are already a Cash Card active. And once you become a direct deposit active as I mentioned in March, we had 1.5 million in the month of direct deposit active you're more likely to use your Cash Card more frequently because you have more of your inflows coming into Cash App and its top of mind for you.
So it's still early on the trends for both of these. For Cash Card as a percent of monthly actives and then, direct deposit as a percent of Cash Card App is, we see a tremendous runway to increase frankly the attached and daily utility of both.
From an instant deposit perspective, we continue to see traction here as well. Of course there are use cases in which customers need to move to their money outside of the platform. We'd love for people to keep their money within the platform and use it in products like Cash Card. But of course there's utility to take money outside of Cash App.
And we continue to see strong growth on products like that but build a diverse -- our interest is in building a diversified product set and revenue streams across multiple of these products. So we're not dependent on any one. And so we can increase our utility for our customers. Great. Thank you very much for the thoughts Amrita. Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi Jack and Amrita, thank you so much for taking my questions this afternoon. Could you give us an update on the Cash App strategy when it comes to international expansion? And sort of when we might see, Cash App rolled out in some new geography, you guys are obviously actively rolling out seller in a lot of new geographies.
So maybe any comments you can give us on timing and/or sort of like what needs to occur from a product, or organizational, or compliance perspective, or any other types of challenges you need to overcome in order to kind of clear the way for that? Thank you. Yeah. And as I said earlier, this remains a top priority for the Cash App team as well. We're going to make sure the service is a global service so we're serving people all around the world. There's the two main strategies that we're exploring for expansion. The first is with our products. And just like Square making sure that we bring parity to new markets. So we launched the ability to send funds between the US and the UK and have seen steady growth of the UK customers in transaction frequency over the past year learning a lot from that launch and that will inform our next moves.
And the second is through M&A. We acquired a European financial mobile app based out of Spain which is called Verse. And that has also taught us a lot that will inform our next moves. So we want to push really hard on this and there's multiple paths to do so. But our end goal is to make sure the Cash App is global and that we are bringing parity across all of our products to all the markets in the same way that we're trying to do with the Square ecosystem. And the Afterpay piece as well here Ramsey it helps with us in terms of getting access to consumer still in markets outside the US through Afterpay that we can then leverage as we bring Cash App and the Cash App brand in those markets. Thank you. Your next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping to get an update on Cash App Taxes and the traction that you guys have seen to date. Amrita your comment about this being the highest quarterly inflows you've seen, I'm assuming taxes as a partial contributor to that in 1Q. But just any color on the percentage of the user base you've seen uptake from. Any way you can isolate the tailwind to Q1. And then any expectations for kind of what the cadence of the impact could be in the second quarter as well? Thanks. Sure. Yeah. Let me jump in here and give you some stats on Cash App Taxes. As you know in January we launched our free digital tax filing service for customers. It really simplifies the experience which has historically been complicated expensive unwieldy for customers. It simplifies the experience and our customers can get their tax refund sooner if they're direct depositing in the Cash App.
And at the end of tax season we had more than 1.5 million people filing their taxes with Cash App Taxes. We find that these filers to Cash App Taxes are more engaged with the Cash App ecosystem. They're twice as likely to use paycheck deposits in the first quarter compared to the average monthly actives. And they are driving inflows as you noted into the platform. 75% of those who used Cash App Taxes and have a Cash Card account selected Cash App as their refund method.
We have always seen the tax season in the past has been driver of inflows for us in the Cash App. And we've seen that again in the first quarter. It's a piece of the inflows that come into Cash App more broadly. So I wouldn't say that that's necessarily different this quarter than in the past what we've historically seen. But what Cash App Taxes does is it helps bring awareness to our broader banking platform to the ability to direct deposit. And it's a utility for our customers that's seamless and provides value to them to the broader integrated suite of products that we have for them making deposits even easier. Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Beck from KBCM. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the in-store efforts for the BNPL space. It certainly seems like there's more energy being put. Obviously, it creates a much larger portion of the wallet that you can capture. Certainly, Afterpay I think has had really good success with this strategy internationally. Obviously, with the combination of Block and Square, you have lots of unique assets that I think potentially accelerate that. So just will be curious on how important the in-store component you see for BNPL as the driver for that segment? When you say in-store you mean people actually being present within the -- in the store person to person? Yes. Yes. I mean that I think is the beautiful thing about our models. We -- our focus on omnichannel means that we don't really have any boundaries with regards to where customers are. So Africa and a lot of buy now pay later services have focused traditionally on e-commerce. And we wanted to make sure that our solutions work everywhere whether that be through a phone order online or offline at the store and the experience should be more or less the same throughout.
So I think all these behaviors tend to ebb and flow. You see a lot of activity in e-commerce and then you see more in offline and vice versa. We just want to make sure that we provide the ultimate flexibility to our sellers. It doesn't matter where their customers are we want to help them make the sale.
And the reason Afterpay is so important to us is because the buy now pay later functionality and use case allows our sellers to make more sales. And it allows their customers to quickly act on their decision in a very favorable way. So we certainly expect a lot of strength off-line as we do online.
And as we ramp-up our experiments with the Discover tab in Cash App. Obviously we'll see a lot more of that online activity, but we can also use that to drive people to offline experiences at merchants around them and within their neighborhood. I think that's really special, really unique hasn't been done before as far as I know in a cohesive way and certainly not to be to the simplicity extent that we bring to bear with all of our services and all of our apps. And I'll just add to that Josh. You've heard us talk about this in the past I think last quarter too that what we see for Afterpay in their more established markets like Australia and New Zealand what we see there is an increasing presence across omnichannel not just online, but also in-person. And that omnichannel consumers who are using buy now pay later in-person as well as online transact at higher rates than online-only consumers because it becomes a part of how they manage their cash flow it becomes top of mind for them in terms of how they make purchases.
And that is something that we think as Jack spoke to is unique about our platform in that there's a lot of complementarity between the Square platform and the Afterpay platform and how we can help Afterpay grow with our access to millions of sellers across the US and outside the US both online and in-person. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks guys. I just wanted to come back to a couple of the April metrics specifically the Square GPV year-over-year growth and the Cash App gross profit year-over-year growth. If I'm not mistaken the year-over-year comps actually get quite a bit easier I believe in May and June relative to April levels for both those metrics. So is it reasonable to think that growth could accelerate off those April levels against those easier comps during the balance of the quarter? I mean assuming no significant macro changes. And then just a quick housekeeping clarification on the OpEx growth for the year ex-Afterpay. I think you said $1.2 billion. Am I right that last quarter it was $1.3 billion so you're $100 million less now? Thank you. Sure. So what I would say for April is that you're right that March and April of last year are tough comps for us because of the significant government fund disbursements that came about last year. That's part of why I would orient you more to those three-year CAGR metrics that I was sharing for April where we do see some more consistency between the periods that we're looking at here from Q1 into April and where you do get to normalize around some of those COVID comps that you're speaking to in the prior year time frame.
So again I would orient you to the three-year metrics that we're seeing where Square GPV growth on a three-year basis in April came in at about 24%. Cash App gross profit ex Afterpay coming in at about 85%. And so still strong continued growth. And again, the three-year CAGR help normalize for some of the year-over-year.
The second part of your question on OpEx was really just some refinement for us based on the pacing of the expected investments for the remainder of the year. The reduction here is relatively minimal in the context of the broader non-GAAP OpEx expected investments for 2022 less than a 4% decrease as we refine these numbers. And for Block ex Afterpay it's really just about reflecting the pacing spend for some of the newer and experimental marketing channels. Thank you. And for our last question, we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on the solid results here. The one question I had was on Afterpay. The growth rate decelerated some off of last year's pace in April. I think you talked about expect something around a 15% volume growth, which is probably going to be below some of the industry peers. So just trying to figure out how much of that is that you guys really haven't fully rolled out integration into the product yet and would expect that number to accelerate from here? And how much of that maybe taking a more conservative risk profile given the macro environment we're in? Thanks. Sure. What I would say for Afterpay is that our focus in the near term is around growing our customer base, managing our loss rates and driving increased consumer frequency as I mentioned earlier, and we're happy with the progress we're making on each of those pieces. And you're right, we have not yet fully integrated or seen the vision come to life yet across the connecting points between merchants and consumers whether Square and Cash App platform, you hear a lot of -- you'll hear a lot more about that in a couple of weeks at Investor Day.
We -- our teams are deep at work on that integrated commerce vision. And we have so much more to come on that, which we're really excited about. We really think we have a differentiated offering to provide over the long-term here as we think about how our commerce platform will be different from others. And we think we can be truly differentiated on non-price factors when you think about the consumer scale that we have across Cash App and Afterpay.
And then when you think about the merchant scale that we have across Square and Afterpay, we believe that what we're building will be resilient and a sustainable strategy over the long-term for both sides of the ecosystem merchants and consumers. We hope to lay all that out for you at Investor Day on May 18. Thank you presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes today's call.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. I'll start with a few highlights across our business from the quarter.
We continue to make progress, connecting our ecosystems. The connections we are building like with Afterpay are what set us apart and make us so valuable to our customers. In Cash App, we're just starting to bring Afterpay's discovery capabilities into our ecosystem. The greatest combined opportunity we see is in commerce. Afterpay will introduce discovery and shopping to build on the elements that Cash App is already created around commerce, like Cash App Pay and Boost. We believe our new design with Cash App will let us scale new products and drive deeper engagement. We're rolling out a new Discover tab to the main navigation, making it easier for customers to find and use brands and products that can save on with Boost and Pay in with installments with Afterpay.
This lays the foundation for new experience and enables customers to connect with one another, find offers and search. And this is just the beginning. We've seen early results, but we believe that over time Cash App will become one of the best ways to discover products, brands, and businesses.
Also, within Cash App, in the second quarter, we introduced a new investing feature Round Ups, as part of our work to make investing relatable and accessible for everyone. Customers can now Round Ups their Cash App Card purchases and invest the spare change in stock or Bitcoin. Round Ups engage customers on other products within our ecosystem, creating more reasons for customers to bring money into the Cash App ecosystem.
Within our Square ecosystem, in May we announce the in-person integration of Afterpay for Square sellers in the U.S., in Australia, adding to the online capabilities we announced earlier this year with more products to come. The addition of in-person, Afterpay is the omnichannel tool in our ecosystem, which many of our sellers haven't typically had access to helping sellers grow their sales, both online and in-person.
We've also continued to add tools and services to our Square for Restaurant offering, to help restaurants of every size and type grow and run their business. Our product suite helps restaurants with every aspect of running a business from delivery orders to team management. During the quarter, we added new hardware and software solutions, including a mobile point-of-sale to help restaurants efficiently take orders and payments tableside or online and turn more tables and grow sales. We also made it easier for restaurants to get started with Square by adding ability to import menus, along with automated menu creation from PDF, photo, or website.
And with that here's Amrita. Thanks Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover today. First, an update on our performance for the second quarter of 2022. Second, trends across our business in July, and third, are planned investments for 2022, where we are being disciplined in preparation from multiple macro scenarios.
In the second quarter, we delivered strong growth across our ecosystems, with gross profit of $1.47 billion, up 29% year-over-year and 47% on a three-year CAGR basis. Gross profit includes an $18 million impact from the amortization of acquired technology assets, and excluding these non-cash expenses, gross profit was $1.49 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $187 million.
For the second quarter, our BNPL platform, which we acquired through the acquisition of Afterpay, contributed $150 million of gross profit, split across Square and Cash App. And excluding this gross profit for the quarter was $1.32 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis and 42% on a three-year CAGR basis.
Square generated $755 million of gross profit in the second quarter, an increase of 29% year-over-year and 30% on a three-year CAGR basis. Excluding $75 million of gross profit from our BNPL platform, Square gross profit was $681 million, up 16% year-over-year and 25% on a three-year CAGR basis.
Looking into the drivers of second quarter performance. First, we saw continued healthy retention across our existing seller base. In the second quarter, we achieved positive GTV and gross profit retention for our Square business. Second, we continue to deliver on our strategic priority of going upmarket. Gross profit for mid-market sellers was up 24% year-over-year and 40% on a three-year CAGR basis. We've seen continued momentum in food and drink, which has delivered the fastest gross profit growth of any Square vertical on a five-year CAGR basis.
As Jack mentioned, Square for Restaurant has been an important driver of our success here through the first half of the year, GPV from Square for Restaurant sellers more than doubled year-over-year. With these sellers using an average of four monetized products during the second quarter.
Third, we've experienced continued success expanding globally. Including Afterpay our market outside the U.S. represented 13% of Square's gross profit in the second quarter. We remain focused on improving product parody globally and launched 44 products in our international markets during the first half of the year. We believe that bringing more of our ecosystem, these markets helps increase our value to sellers.
Cash App generated $705 million of gross profit in the second quarter, an increase of 29% year-over-year and 88% on a three-year CAGR basis. Excluding our BNPL platform, Cash App gross profit was $630 million, up 15% year-over-year and 82% on a three-year CAGR basis. This quarter, we had our highest quarterly inflows ever into Cash App, with overall inflows increasing both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Let's discuss some of the drivers here using our inflows framework, looking at active and inflows per active. First, we continued growth for monthly transacting actives, reaching $47 million as of June, up 18% year-over-year with weekly and daily actives growing even faster. We have been focused on enhancing the reality of peer-to-peer by expanding our presence in new demographics. When an active has more of their friends and family using Cash App, they have more reasons to come back and their retention often improves. In the first quarter, retention was 31 percentage points higher for active with a network size of four or more other accounts compared to those with a network size of one. A focus of our community pillar has been to deepen our presence in lower penetrated regions and demographics by broadening our go-to-market efforts and enabling more social discovery of our products.
Second, inflows per active averaged $1,048 in the second quarter, which was relatively stable compared to the first quarter, even at the seasonal impact and tax refunds subsided and was down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to government disbursements in the prior year. By having a full suite of financial product, Cash App has been able to drive more banking customers who are highly engaged, bringing in more inflows on average and typically use multiple products across our ecosystem. And with the introduction of Cash App Borrow, our first credit product, we have greater breadth to offer our banking customers and more ways to deliver value.
Cash App Borrow has seen strong, early momentum. Similar to our lending products across -- other lending products across Block, we're focused on two areas. First, we're building fair and accessible products for our customers. Cash App Borrow offers short duration loans where customers have taken out loans amounting to less than $200 on average in a month. These loans can be paid back either in installments or as a percentage of inflows into Cash App. Many of these customers may have been left out by traditional financial institutions, and we believe unique insights from our broader ecosystem allows us to serve them in a responsible manner.
Second, we've achieved profitable unit economics on Borrow, driven by discipline around risk. Using automation and machine learning models, we proactively offer loans to some of our most engaged customers. Borrow actives brought four times more inflows into Cash App compared to active, who only use peer-to-peer. This discipline around eligibility criteria combined with multiple frictionless ways to payback has allowed us to generate meaningful improvements in risk loss as we iterated on the product over time, achieving loss rates of less than 3% as of the second quarter.
Our approach to expanding access with discipline on risk is how we've operated Square loans. And it has allowed us to scale Cash App Borrow to 1 million monthly active as of June. Further Cash App Borrow has benefited our broader ecosystem. In the second quarter, over half of these loans were used to fund transactions on Cash App Card or peer-to-peer transfers. While we've seen strength so far, we are also being mindful of the environment. This is a short duration product where we determine eligibility based on unique data signals, which we believe enables us to pivot quickly. As with the rest of our business, we are tracking trends in real-time to monitor any changes, and we intend on acting conservatively with each of our credit products as the macro environment evolves.
Shifting to Afterpay. In the second quarter, GMV for Afterpay was $5.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year or 65% on a three-year CAGR basis. For overall growth trends, we've seen impacts from spend shifts from online to in-person, competitive dynamics, as well as foreign currency, which slowed year-over-year GMV growth by five points. We've seen growth hold up better in our more mature regions like Australia, which is more diversified across discretionary and non-discretionary verticals, as well as in-person and online channels. Trends have flowed more in North America, a newer market for Afterpay, where the primary verticals of fashion and beauty are both discretionary retail and where the Afterpay in-person product is still ramping.
As we integrate Afterpay, we see an opportunity to further diversify, particularly in the U.S. with our base of millions of Square sellers, across a range of high ticket verticals and omnichannel products. On a GAAP basis, revenue for our BNPL platform was up 6% year-over-year, growing slower than GMV given makeshift newer markets. Gross profit was down 2% year-over-year impacted by $11 million in amortization of intangibles within cost of sales. Without this impact gross profit growth would've been more in line with revenue growth.
Losses on consumer receivables were 1.02% of GMV during the second quarter, an improvement compared to 1.17% in the first quarter, driven by mixed shifts as well as enhancements to our risk models and processes during the first half of the year. We continued to see healthy consumer repayment behavior with 90% -- 95% of installment paid on time.
Next, an update on recent trends through July. We expect overall company gross profit growth of approximately 35% on a year-over-year basis, including our BNPL platform or 22% excluding our BNPL platform. The year-over-year growth rate improved compared to the second quarter. Although, the three-year CAGR helps normalize for the unusual growth comparisons during the pandemic. On a three-year CAGR basis, we expect overall growth to be consistent with a 47%, three-year CAGR we delivered in the second quarter or a 42% three-year CAGR excluding our BNPL platform.
Let's look into trends by ecosystem. For Cash App in July, we expect gross profit, excluding our BNPL platform, to grow by 32% year-over-year and be relatively consistent with the 82% three-year CAGR in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we've seen growth in actives and overall inflows in July, while inflows per active decline slightly given government disbursements in the prior year. On a three-year CAGR basis, inflows per active growth was in the mid-teens in July and relatively consistent with the first and second quarters.
JULY spend per active on Cash App Card achieved positive growth on a year-over-year basis, with a three-year CAGR also in the mid-teens and July spend on Cash App Card increased compared to the monthly average in the second quarter. The mix of discretionary and non-discretionary spend remained relatively consistent with the second quarter. We have seen a diverse range of use cases on Cash App Card with 33% of spend on gas utilities and travels, 30% on food and grocery, and 22% at big box and discount retailers. While we expect Cash App year-over-year growth rate to improve in the third quarter, we expect to see a slight moderation in the three-year CAGR as we begin to lap the launch of tabs in 2019, and as Cash App continues to grow off of a much larger base.
For Square in July, we expect gross profit, excluding our BNPL platform, to grow by 14% year-over-year, and to be consistent with a three-year CAGR of 25% in the second quarter. Square GPV is expected to be up 18% year-over-year in July. On a three-year CAGR basis, GPV growth is expected to be 23% in line with second quarter trends.
Diversity among our seller base from our mix of channels and verticals has helped drive the stability. We're seeing faster growth from card present volumes compared to card not present volumes as in-person channels of offset some recent mix shifts from online channels. And across three of our largest discretionary verticals, food and drink, retail, and beauty and personal care growth was relatively stable on a three-year CAGR basis.
As we had expected Square GPV continued to grow faster than gross profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued normalization and transaction based gross profit margins. And as we lap non-recurring PPP gross profit of $30 million in Q3 of 2021 and $59 million in Q4 of 2021. We expect the delta between GPV and gross profit growth to continue through the remainder of 2022 on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to our BNPL platform in July, we expect GMV to be up 12% year-over-year or 61% on a three-year CAGR basis. In July, we expect GAAP gross profit to increase 1% year-over-year. On a GAAP gross profit basis, Afterpay's results are impacted by expenses related to the amortization of intangible asset, which is expected to be $12 million on a quarterly basis going forward.
We remain focused on unlocking the opportunities we see with our integration and the vision we outlined at Investor Day, we believe our combined scale will be a key differentiator as we bring Afterpay to Cash App consumers and a Square's diverse seller base.
Shifting to our expectations for the remainder of the third quarter and full year. As we shared on our last earnings call, we continue to believe Cash App year-over-year gross profit growth rate, excluding Afterpay, will improve in the second half of the year compared to the first half, as comparisons become more favorable as newer commerce and financial services products ramp, and with the benefit of certain pricing adjustments. Also consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, for the remainder of 2022, we expect Cash App and Square to sequentially grow gross profit each quarter throughout the year, even excluding Afterpay, assuming the macroeconomic environment remains stable.
Moving to our planned investments for the third quarter and remainder of the year. While gross profit trends within healthy through July, we recognize the importance of exercising discipline with our investments as we enter a period of potential uncertainty. As a result, we are reducing our planned investments for the full year 2022 by $250 million. We pulled back on experimental and less efficient go-to-market spend, adjusted risk loss estimates based on more current trends and slowed the pace of hiring. In total, we have now reduced our non-GAAP operating expense plan by a total of $450 million since the start of the year, which is 20% of what we initially guided for the step-up in 2022.
As we outline at Investor Day, each of our Cash App and Square ecosystems has a large portion of variable expenses in discretionary levers, which we can pull. And we believe this gives us the ability to be nimble based on changes to the environment. For 2022, we now expect to increase overall non-GAAP operating expenses by $1.85 billion compared to 2021, roughly 10% less than what we shared last quarter. Within this, we now expect Afterpay's operating expense base to be approximately $750 million this year. And excluding Afterpay, we expect to grow overall non-GAAP operating expenses by 30% year-over-year or $1.1 billion.
As we previously shared on a dollar basis, we expect to deliver greater adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of the year. For the third quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses by $75 million compared to the second quarter or $65 million when excluding Afterpay.
In closing, there are two aspects of our business that we believe can help us navigate potential uncertainty with agility. We believe the diversity inherent in our ecosystem model adds resilience in a dynamic environment as our businesses diversified across customer types, product lines, business models, and multiple ecosystems. And second, across our ecosystems, we have a number of signals into the health of consumers and businesses. We're tracking these trends in real-time and we'll use them to act quickly and prudently and to guide our business decisions. Our long-term priorities remain serving our customers, delivering profitable growth and executing with financial discipline.
With that, we'll open it up to your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate the product updates and the development pillars. I like that in the letter. Actually at least my question on the financials and what you just commented there in terms of curbing some of your spend. Because I think about spending on product and marketing, right, for Block is sort of a hallmark for the company, right, to drive differentiated growth.
So, my question is just trying to balance the needs of your employees that want to hyper budget, I'm sure to keep building out great products, but also sounds like you're being mindful as well of the macro and for shareholders that care more about profitability. So, just trying to understand how you balance all of that? And what benchmarks you're really looking at to balance both growth and the investments, if that makes sense. Thanks. Thanks for the question Tien-Tsin. We are very mindful of profitability and demonstrating discipline here. Of course, as you say, we have to balance this with the large market opportunity we're addressing and our opportunity to take share gains at a time when customers need us. So, we are continuing to invest given the vast market opportunities we see. But we also recognize that the environment has changed, and we're prepared to adapt to uncertainty and maintain discipline by pulling back on some of the discretionary operating expenses, particularly those that are less efficient.
So, our actions today show that we are also focused on demonstrating greater near-term profitability as we head into what could be a more volatile macro environment. In only the first six months here this year, we've pulled back on our full year OpEx by 8% or $450 million, $250 million of which came today across three primary areas, sales and marketing, risk loss, which as you know, is both an input and an output for us, and hiring. This shows how we can dial our knobs in real-time and be disciplined. And we've intend on bringing a similar level of rigor to how we think about the remainder of the year and 2023 as we enter into planning.
We have more discretionary OpEx levers across those three areas, as well as corporate overhead that we could explore based on how we see the environment play out. While the breadth of utility to our customers across our ecosystems has held our business up well to date, what we uniquely have is real-time read on our business and on millions of consumers and businesses, which enables us to pivot quickly and take the appropriate actions that we need to take for our business.
So, we're focused on driving long-term profitability growth. Behind the strong structural profitability of both Square and Cash App, 2022 has been a significant investment year for us with Afterpay and with the investments in the Cash and Square. And as we look towards the remainder of the year and planning ahead for 2023, we intend on being purposeful with our investments and will be dynamic to adapt them to any further changes we see in the macro environment. Yeah. No, it's clear and encouraging. Thank you. Appreciate it. Our next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I want to hit a little bit on Cash App commerce initiatives. Jack, you talked a little bit about this in the prepared remarks in terms of the new Discover tab, the in-app capabilities there. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the roadmap a little further, whether some of the commerce can be done in the app, if it's going to be clicked off to other sites, and how that might look over time?
And then the second aspect is Cash App Pay not within the app, but maybe you could give an update on the merchant acceptance of Cash App Pay with non-Square or non-Afterpay merchants? Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, this really gets at the heart at exactly why we made the acquisition of Afterpay in the first place is because we believe that Cash App ultimately can drive a ton of discovery for merchants all around the world, but especially around local merchants. And not just businesses, but products and services that people would otherwise not have had a signal around. So, we believe that Cash App ultimately becomes a place that you want to check not on a weekly basis, but every single day because it consistently gives you a good sense of your friends and families, the businesses around you, products and services that you're interested in, offers such as Boost, all in one place.
So, a number of you have probably seen the Discovery tab in your Cash App. We're rolling it out to more and more people right now. But we're really excited about this, because we believe that the biggest part of our future is around connecting people with commerce and transactions in particular with local merchant, but also merchants around the world.
Afterpay is our solution around that. And we think there's a huge opportunity to make these connections not just with the Afterpay merchants, but the entire Square ecosystem as well, which really speaks to our strength in connecting these two ecosystems together.
In terms of Cash App Pay, in the second quarter we made a lot of strides scaling Cash App Pay to more Afterpay sellers, allowing more merchants software both Buy Now, Pay Later and Cash App Pay at checkout. And since launching Square sellers in September of last year, there have been more than 2 million transactions through Cash App Pay, and this has been mainly organic adoption. And we've signed partnerships with several enterprise Afterpay merchants who will begin offering Cash App Pay as a payment method. And we hope to bring this even further to our sales team on broadening Cash App Pay acceptance to more and more of our merchants within the Afterpay merchant base, but also the Square merchant base as well. Great. Thank you for that update on the merchant acceptance. Appreciate you taking the question. Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hey, guys. If you could just touch on the behavior that you're seeing with customers and consumers across the business, given the backdrop of the macro uncertainty, especially in the Cash Card side. Also, your EBITDA came in well above expectations and obviously, happy to hear about the incremental steps being taken on the OpEx side. But if you could just revisit the investments into Cash App, because it does sound like, at least into July, it was stable on a CAGR -- three-year CAGR basis, I think you said 82%. Maybe just some tough comps coming up aside from that. Thanks. Thanks for the question there, Darrin. Happy to start out. So, from a Cash App perspective, we are seeing sort of stability in the trend lines on a three-year CAGR basis across sort of the customer cohorts that we look at and on a blended basis across Cash App. Let's unpack a little bit of what we've seen here across our product set, which we believe provides diversity and breadth of utility for our Cash App customers, across engagement, which we would measure as transactions and inflows per active, and then across monetization or sort of our revenue streams. And then, I'll come back to your point about EBITDA.
From a product perspective, look, we've -- as you've seen with our development pillars across financial services, commerce, community, crypto, there are a number of things that we're doing where we're building relationships and seeing product adoption from our customers. And that enables us to be dynamic in environments like this, where we see a product providing differential utility in that environment and being able to double down quickly. An example of that obviously being in the early days of COVID, our ability to move quickly to enable direct deposit access to our customers to receive government disbursements. In an environment like this, Cash App Card is becoming an increasing part of broad-based use cases for our customers.
What we saw -- as I mentioned earlier on Cash App Card, is positive growth of spend per active in July, even relative to Q2, with a consistent mix across discretionary and non-discretionary verticals alike. So, product diversity is a key pillar for us and continued growth with Cash App and in how we can serve our customers through dynamic times.
Engagement is another key lever for us. And what we see here is that obviously, as I mentioned earlier, certain products perform better at certain times. But on a blended basis, we're seeing our strongest engagement in terms of transactions per active in recent months with July at 21 times per active. Inflows per active, overall, has grown over time as well. And that's something that we'd like to see continue to grow. In July, we had mid-teens growth on an inflows per active basis on a three-year CAGR basis. And so, that's led to an overall diversification of our revenue streams and our monetization across various business models, which ultimately has enabled us to continue to invest in the business across a variety of at scale revenue streams and with some newer ramping revenue streams like Cash App Pay, which obviously Jack was just talking about as well as Cash App Borrow and other banking and commerce products.
From an EBITDA perspective, look, we're continuing to invest in our business across the seven pillars that we outlined at Investor Day. From a product development standpoint as well as from a sales and marketing standpoint, we're going to be disciplined to make sure that the areas of investment are the areas that have the strongest likelihood of return. And I think that's part of what you're seeing in terms of our operating expense guide, which is obviously an operating expense guide for the whole company, of which Cash App is a key part. But given signs of stability that we see so far, obviously, we continue to read these trends in real-time. We want to continue to invest to ensure that we remain highly valuable to our customer base and can even take share through dynamic times like this. Really helpful. Thank you, guys. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just a follow-up a bit on the macro point there. Are you starting to see any signs of changes in, say, spending or borrowing behavior across either the Square base or Cash App or BNPL base as a result of the macro environment? Just thinking about your exposure to SMBs and middle income consumers. And I guess kind of maybe take a step back overall, how are you feeling about how a weaker -- potentially weaker macro environment might affect you? I could imagine there are some positives and some negatives. Thank you. Sure. I'm happy to start here. Thanks for the question, Lisa. And since I shared a couple of stats on the Cash App perspective in the last question, maybe I'll share some incremental stats on the Square perspective. I think similar story from a three-year CAGR basis with respect to gross profit being relatively stable from Q2 into July. Of course, there are pockets of shifts underneath the surface with respect to performance. For instance, as I mentioned earlier, mix shift from online to in-person. But the breadth of our Square ecosystem is what enables us to capture the stronger performance in-person even as we see normalizing mix shifts from online.
And the other thing I'd say here with respect to our strategy before maybe double-clicking on some of the specifics is that our strategy has been to grow in these areas that add diversity and add broader footprint for us. So, the three top strategic investments for the Square business for some years now and into 2022 are growing upmarket with larger sellers who we've seen have generally larger -- greater resilience through macro volatility, growing our omnichannel capabilities, which obviously, again, helps us navigate mixing spending patterns or shifts in spending patterns across channels; and growing globally, which enables us to see a broader range of sellers, including outside of the United States.
And ultimately, it's that breadth of our ecosystems, including the Square ecosystem, which has enabled us to be resilient through macro changes, as we've seen, even during the pandemic, which obviously impacted the Square business particularly and has enabled us to grow at a pace faster than the broader industry.
Maybe just to give you a couple of stats in terms of verticals and seller mix that we see in real-time. We have obviously a diverse base of sellers, millions of sellers. From a vertical perspective, we span a range of verticals. So, 40% of Square GPV comes from a range of services verticals in 2021. The remaining 60% is across some of those discretionary areas like food and beverage, retail and other smaller, but growing verticals where we've continued to see stability from a three-year CAGR perspective. From a seller size perspective, as I said, continue to grow upmarket. In the second quarter, two-thirds of our volume in the Square business is from larger sellers, $125,000 in annual GPV or more. And historically, those larger sellers have been more resilient through downturns. And as we've said, larger seller, broader retention within the Square business, even including our smaller sellers, has been positive across GPV and gross profit in the second quarter and into July.
And the final point I'd make here is that again the diversity of the products that we offer our customers, which go beyond commerce and payments and include customer staff, banking and other products that drive retention and multiple points of value that we can offer our sellers. And we're seeing, as we increasingly stretch to mid-market sellers, that they're adopting more products. Mid-market sellers on average adopt four products in our ecosystem, which enables us to get hired for multiple tools and value that we can provide to our customers, which again adds resilience.
So, those are kind of the key areas that I would focus to and what we're seeing in real-time. But of course, we're mindful of the environment and are reading all of these stats in real-time to be able to make proactive and front footed adjustments as needed. Thank you. Very helpful. Our next question comes from Kunaal Malde with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you. Amrita, I guess, you're seeing good growth across the lending products at the moment, and now you're scaling Cash App Borrow. But could you kind of expand on your comments about risk loss, and how you're thinking about credit risk across these products, particularly given the macro risks? Of course. Thanks Kunaal. So, look, I think there's two attributes that we ensure all of our lending product teams are laser-focused on. One is a data-driven approach and the second is the unique structure, optimizing for the unique structure of our products relative to many others out there. From a data-driven approach, our risk in underwriting machine learning models get updated in real-time and based on a broad set of customer data, whether you're looking at Borrow -- Cash App Borrow, Square Loans and Afterpay receivables. And specifically with Borrow and Loans, we determine the eligibility criteria, which ultimately is responsible in terms of helping to protect the customer and Block. And what that does is it enables us to read that data and move quickly in times of change, as we did at the start of the pandemic, as you know, with the Square Loans business.
The unique structure of our products is really designing our products to simplify access to capital for customers and to make it easy to pay them back. These products are generally short duration, and they have a simplified repayment process, including, for some products, being first in that payback priority. And these generally -- short-duration Square Loans is well less than a year in terms of duration, Afterpay terms 15 times per year, four to six weeks at average and Cash App Borrow, all similarly terms with less than a month in terms of repayment on average. What that means is that we're laser-focused on managing risk loss as an input to how we run these businesses and the underwriting decision-making that we employ across products, enabling us to be more front footed in a dynamic environment.
And as a result, we are seeing loss rates on Cash App Borrow, which is earlier in its life and consistent with where Square Loans has been at less than 3% and positive unit economics there on Cash App Borrow and of course, Square Loans. And then for Afterpay, we're seeing a 1% loss rate, which actually improved slightly from Q1 into Q2 on the back of mix shifts, as well as enhancements that we're making here to the risk loss models. So, a key area of focus for us and one that we're deliberately looking to manage. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Afterpay integration path. Obviously, it seems like you're making some very good headway with respect to commerce discovery, as well as the API for sellers. Once we start to get into some of these longer term integration priorities, I'm just kind of curious now that you have owned the company for a complete quarter, how you feel like you're tracking against those. And really, any guidance on what metrics we should look for in terms of synergies. Obviously, it's one of these opportunities that can really show up across the business. So, curious to hear a little bit about the integration path, and what we should be watching for there. Thank you for the question. I'll start and Amrita can follow-up with more numbers. But I think the biggest reason for this acquisition was to bring two ecosystems together, so to really improve the ecosystem model between Square and also Cash App.
On the Cash App side, as I talked about before, we're really focused on discovery, discovery of merchants around you, products, services, offers like Boost. A number of you have probably seen the Discovery tab. You can find it within Cash App by looking for the magnifying glass at the bottom of your navigation.
We intend this to be a place where you can find everything related to what you might want within Cash App, be it sending money to people like your friends or buying products or services for merchants around your -- across the internet. So that is a big part of our focus, and a big aspect of what we believe is important about this acquisition.
The second is on the Square ecosystem side, offering a tool for Square sellers to ensure that they can make more sales. And day one of the start after we closed, we offered the service online and are now offering it in-person as well. So, we are very early with this integration, and it does take time to have an integration of this size. But we believe as we continue to push forward, we will see a ton of synergies between everything that we're doing on the Cash App and also the Square side to bring these two ecosystems together. And that really is the aspect that we think is most powerful in this partnership that a lot of our peers in the industry do not have. They often are focused on one aspect, such as Buy Now, Pay Later and not focused on the connection between all these things, especially the consumer and also the merchant side.
So, we will continue to increase our customers' ability to discover new products and services within Cash App, but also make it easier for our sellers to turn on these features so that they can make more sales. And the more we do that, the more the ecosystems benefit and the more our customers value us. Yeah. And I'd just add, Josh, that I think you're right that from a synergy perspective, we should expect to see opportunities that span beyond just the Buy Now, Pay Later platform into each of the Square and Cash App revenue streams and lines of opportunity as we think about increasingly creating that marketplace that connects sellers and consumers alike. We are more fully integrating the people who run these businesses from a product perspective, a marketing perspective, a customer service perspective. And I'd expect us to see opportunities over time, both from top line and cost optimization to be able to really drive stronger unit economics, as well as to drive those opportunities that Jack is referencing across the broader commerce opportunity.
I'd also point you back to, as we said on the -- in my interim remarks, the diversity and the sort of complementary aspects of our customer bases is also an opportunity for us to continue to explore as we go deeper with these product integrations. We provided diversity in terms of seller size, in terms of verticals, and in terms of channels to the Afterpay, BNPL platform through our Square integration. And Afterpay provides to us similarly a deeper exploration of both commerce and financial services with consumers and merchants.
So, there are a number of things to unpack here from a product integration standpoint, and I expect to see that play out in a broader way across the P&L over the long-term as we make those integrations. Very helpful. Thanks, Jack and Amrita. Our next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James. Your line is open. Hey. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to touch a little bit on Cash App active growth. Still remains very healthy, but has slowed a little bit, I think, as expected as we lap stimulus and obviously crypto weakness. But I wanted to drill down and see, Amrita, maybe just a little bit of detail on kind of top of funnel, like new customers versus churn. I think it's only natural, you probably have a little bit elevated churn. Like what are you doing to try and keep customers active on Cash App that may have been driven to the app by stimulus? Is there a chance we could see a reacceleration in kind of net new active growth if we kind of digest this churn? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe I can start and Jack, obviously, should add in. So, one thing I'd say is that 47 million monthly transacting assets, what we're seeing is sort of broad-based appeal, particularly for digital native Gen Z and millennials, but even more broadly than that. And we think that there's so much more opportunity to go deeper here as we outlined in some of the TAM numbers at our Investor Day. To look at the more detailed specifics on sort of a quarter-to-quarter basis, the pace for growth in monthly active base can be influenced by seasonal impacts.
For instance, in Q1 with tax refunds, we historically see that -- seen Q1 be a stronger quarter from an active and inflows per active perspective as they have greater spending power and look to deploy that. We grew our monthly active base by the same amount in Q1 and Q2, although with the seasonal strength in March from -- related to that sort of tax seasonality.
What we look at from a go-to-market perspective has been fairly consistent so far. Through the first half of 2022, we continue to see strong long-term returns on our investments. And the cost of acquisition for net new actives has been in line with what we saw in 2021. With continued engagement, as I said earlier, product adoption across the range of financial services and commerce offerings that ultimately drives that higher lifetime value for our customers, which enables us, again, of course, to reinvest.
And the other thing I'd point out is that, as I mentioned in the interim remarks, one of the key things that we think about as we think about retention for our customers is driving stronger connections amongst customers within Cash App. We see a 31 percentage point stronger retention per actives with the network are four or more in Cash App compared to those with only a network of one. And so, that's a key piece of leaning into our community pillar, making these products and your contacts within Cash App more discoverable in order to drive awareness and to drive retention. The only thing I would add here is, I think one of the important things that we want to continue to focus on and you all have brought up in the past is, we want to make sure that we have diversity of utility. So, we believe it's really important that people may come in for a particular reason, such as what we saw during the stimulus or just a peer-to-peer functionality that we've always provided. But in terms of retention and also new customer acquisition, it really has to do with like how much utility we're offering, that we're not just focused on one thing such as peer-to-peer transactions or investing or Bitcoin or lending, but it is a place -- one place you can do all those things. And we see peers in other industries and other spaces and other countries that have done that very well, which is sometimes referenced as super apps or banks. And we believe that over the long-term, that is the right strategy, and that is both for the Cash App ecosystem and also the Square ecosystem.
And more importantly, the fact that we have both of those in one company, we believe, is our superpower. So, over the long-term, we will continue to see a bunch of ebbs and flows within the markets and macro environments. But our strength relies on the fact that we're not just dependent upon one particular use case, one particular utility, but that we offer all of them. And while one may ebb, the other will flow. And we will continue to build this ecosystem where someone is coming back to the Cash App every single day for something that is of extreme importance in their life, which obviously we believe the relationship with money and people's financial empowerment into the economy is critical, and we hope to serve them in multiple ways. And we think that is a relationship, that is the strength and that resilience. Ultimately, over time, that creates both new customer acquisition, but also retention over time. Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on your comments just now, Jack, I guess, and Amrita. Just in terms of the multiple touch points that you can develop here that would drive benefits such as engagement and retention. I guess, can you give us more detail on the approach or strategy to sort of drive that cross-sell? I mean, obviously, the Discovery tab is a key piece of the puzzle. But I'm just curious what other levers or plans do you have? I don't know if it's marketing investments, partnerships, sponsorships? Is this more of a sort of you will build it and they will come type of situation? Or are you going to need to push the message out a little bit more to kind of force those connections to happen? I think we have a very unique benefit in that like we have critical, regular use network effect, which is -- and you can see this for yourself in how the app behaves in the app store on a biweekly basis, payday in the United States. We continue to see an increase in downloads in the app store. Why? Payday. When people get money, they tend to send it or request it to their friends and family.
So, we have a built-in network effect that is inherently natural to the use case that we want to continue to see grow. And we've built an ecosystem around that. So, just by virtue of people needing to send and receive money to their friends, family, work via a direct deposit and payroll and getting their paychecks, we can build something that is, at least, weekly, if not every two weeks use case and then get to more and more a daily use case, which ultimately is our goal.
We saw a step towards that with Bitcoin. We see a step towards that with the Cash Card. We see it with lending in terms of Borrow. But ultimately, discovery and the Discover tab, as you said, will bring us to that daily use case where people want to open the app every single day, because they find something meaningful there. They find something meaningful in the neighborhood. They find a meaningful product, a meaningful service. They continue to find easy ways to go back to that utility that they have with peer-to-peer. So that is always going to be our strongest acquisition and retention channel. It's entirely organic based on just what people want to do.
Of course, there are many other opportunities in terms of partnerships and marketing and all these other things that we've been very creative around, especially within Cash App. And I think you've seen with our partnerships with various celebrities and artists around the world, however it all comes back to like, is this a use case that people want to use every single day? Is it providing them value? And are they finding and discovering something that ultimately they want to do more of that is adjacent to it. That is the model. And again, it's a model for Cash App, but it's also a model for Square and the rest of our ecosystem, inclusive of TIDAL and TBD. And it doesn't happen overnight, but over the long-term, we believe these relationships that we're building with people, especially in the retention sense, will just continue to grow and continue to be more and more valuable to people, especially given that we have the broadest and ultimately, the deepest relationship with customers and what they want to do in participating with the economy. And I would add, Ramsey, just to sort of provide some more examples on the product forms of connecting points within the Cash App ecosystem, because of course, as Jack mentioned, there are a number of things we can do from partnerships, sponsorship, sales perspective to broaden the platform. But from a product perspective, I think there's three things that I would outline.
One, as Jack said, the network effect inherent in peer-to-peer. You've seen us leverage peer-to-peer not only for sort of standard fiat transfers, but also for Bitcoin and stock transfers to bring visibility to our investing products. You could imagine being able to peer-to-peer send a gift card to a friend as we build out our commerce vertical. So, being able to bring your connections, your friends and family along with you as you experience these other products is an opportunity for us in driving greater adoption.
The second piece from a product perspective is around our Boost network and now superstars even further with Afterpay. But with our Boost network, what we've obviously seen is the opportunity for customers engaged through Cash App Card to get differential incentives and opportunities if they try investing or if they try direct deposit, as an example, where you can provide them with even more incentives. And now with Afterpay and the sort of ad and affiliate networks that they've got, we, with our combined efforts here, have an opportunity to grow that even further.
The third piece I'd say is the product initiatives that we have that enable us to cross-sell and go even deeper with already engaged customers. You can think of those as being direct deposit, where we see it as an attach to Cash App Card. You can see that with our taxes product, which is really seamless to use with our broader -- if you use our financial -- broader financial services suite of products. You can see that with Cash App Borrow, which as we mentioned, we determine eligibility, and we've been offering that to our customers who have multiple higher inflows. So that gives us the chance to go even deeper and offer more value and obviously, monetize some of those products with our customers who are already deeply engaged and really just create a frictionless experience about both broadening the product adoption, as well as going deeper in each of these verticals. That was very comprehensive. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. I'd now like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you for joining our call, and we'll see you next quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude the program.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements, other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary gross profit growth results for the month of October. These represent our current estimate for October performance as we have not yet closed our accounting financials for the month of October and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual October results may differ from these estimates.
Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by and is the responsibility of management. This preliminary financial information has not been reviewed or audited by our independent public accounting firm. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for October or the fourth quarter. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter, investor day materials and investor presentation on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita’s opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. As we've discussed before, we're building multiple ecosystems to serve different audiences. Square for sellers, Cash App for consumers, Tidal for musicians and TBD for developers. What makes Block unique is our ability to connect all of these together. We've made a lot of progress on each and I'll share some highlights from Square and Cash App before Amrita’s remarks and your questions. We'll start with Square; we realize there are some significant challenges all businesses are facing today. And so giving sellers simple and intuitive tools to remove complexity from running their business is critical. We're focused on three priorities to achieve this. Enabling omni channel capabilities. Growing up market and expanding internationally. Core to strategy is building integrated solutions to give larger sellers a cohesive view of their operations so that they can easily manage every aspect of running a business. Our developer platform extends our software capabilities by allowing integrations with hundreds of third-party products built by developers and partners using our open platform. We enable customized solutions for sellers with more complex needs, and provide a single platform for developers to take payments from Square across mobile in person and web. We're also continuing to build up vertical point of sale solutions that serve our largest verticals in food and drink, retail and services with Square for Restaurants, Square for Retail and Square appointments. Together gross profit from these solutions grows 45% year-over-year, much faster than Square overall in the quarter.
In Q3, we also expanded the payment methods we support. In US, we launched Apple’s Tap to Pay on iPhone, giving Square sellers a simple way to accept contactless payments with no hardware needed, and customers a convenient way to pay. In Japan, sellers can now accept pay PayPay QR code payments, the most popular QR code wallet in the country.
And now for Cash App. As we shared during our Investor Day earlier this year, we're focused on building seven development pillars to drive Cash App’s business. I'll touch on progress we made these quarter and financial services and commerce. Within financial services, we want to strengthen our relationships with customers through a full suite of banking products. It starts with customers being able to easily fund their cash up accounts. Over time, we've expanded the ways customers can do this, whether through direct deposit, paper money, cheque deposits, or bank transfers. Cash App Card and direct deposit are two of our most important banking products. And we're focused on growing usage of both. Cash App Card is usually our first financial services product that customers try, and often their introduction to banking with Cash App.
As of September, there were nearly 18 million actives using Cash App Card, making more than 35% of our monthly actives, and bringing in half of all inflows across our platform. In Q3, we made it easier to bank with us, customers can receive an account and routing number instantly when ordering a Cash App Card. This reduces friction for those who need banking services and has driven meaningful growth in direct deposit customers. As we continue to deepen the connections between our ecosystems and undertake the complex integration of after pay, one of the long-term opportunities we are most excited for is in commerce.
In Q3, we completed the rollout of our first iteration of the new Discover tab. Make it seamless for customers to search for people and businesses and find offers including instant discounts for merchants to accept Cash App Pay. Cash App Pay lets customers checkout through a simple QR code payment, whether online or in person. After testing Cash App Pay, Square sellers over the past year, we're beginning to broaden Cash App Pay acceptance outside of the Square ecosystem Starting with select Afterpay merchants. We're still early in our journey to transform Cash App into a commerce destination that bridges our seller and consumer ecosystems. We believe it'll take some time to achieve this vision. And doing so will bring us back to our original mission to help sellers make more sales.
Finally, we know a lot changed in our business over the last year, including with the acquisition of Afterpay. And we recognize that understanding our business today may seem complex, especially in a changing macro environment. We're working to distill how we invest in operate into a clearer and more cohesive framework to help you better understand our business in 2023 and the longer term. Amrita will be addressing some of our current thinking for 2023 today in her remarks, but we plan to do so more comprehensively in our fourth quarter call in February. And with that, here is Amrita. Thanks Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover today. First, an overview of our third quarter results. Second, trends we've seen across our business in October and third our discipline around expenses. In the third quarter, we delivered strong growth across our ecosystems with gross profit of $1.57 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 46% on a three-year CAGR basis. Gross profit includes a $19 million impact in the amortization of acquired technology assets primarily related to Afterpay. And excluding these non-cash expenses gross profit was $1.59 billion. We delivered strong profitability during the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $327 million. In the third quarter, our BNPL platform, which we acquired through the acquisition of Afterpay, contributed $150 million of gross profit split across Square and Cash App, and excluding this gross profit for the quarter was $1.42 billion, up 25% on a year-over-year basis, and 42% on a three-year CAGR basis.
Cash App generated $774 million of gross profit in the third quarter, an increase of 51% year-over-year and 84% on a three-year CAGR basis, excluding our BNPL platform Cash App gross profit was $700 million, up 37% year-over-year and 78% on a three-year CAGR basis. This quarter overall inflows into Cash App totaled $52 billion for growth of 19% year-over-year and represented our highest quarterly inflows into Cash App.
Let's look into the drivers using our inflows framework across active, inflows per active and monetization rate. First, our network reached 49 million transacting actives in September, up 20% on a year-over-year basis, with daily and weekly actives growing even faster. With Cash App community pillar, we remain focused on enhancing the viral growth of peer to peer with complementary marketing programs that target new audiences. Second inflows per active average $1,046 in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent with the first and second quarters and was also stable on a year-over-year basis. Inflows per Active has been driven by continued product adoption with Cash App Card and direct deposit as Jack mentioned, and by expanding our inflow channels. We believe driving inflows per active starts with customers’ ability to easily fund their Cash App accounts through a variety of channels. Together direct deposit and paper money deposits have made up a growing share of overall inflows reaching 14% of inflows in the third quarter, up from 9% a year ago.
In September, customers received more than $2 billion in direct deposits into their Cash App accounts. Driven by strong growth in direct deposit, active and direct deposit inflows per active compared to the prior year. Paper money deposits cross nearly $3.5 billion in cumulative deposits through September, only a year since launch.
Square generated $783 million of gross profit in the third quarter, an increase of 29% both year-over-year and on a three-year CAGR basis, excluding $75 million of gross profits from our BNPL platform, Square gross profit was $708 million, up 17% year-over-year and 25% on a three-year CAGR basis. Square GPV grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter or 22% on a constant currency basis, with a two-point headwind to growth from foreign exchange rates. Looking at our cohort economics, we continue to see healthy retention trends across our existing seller base. In the third quarter, we achieved positive GPV and gross profit retention for our Square business. Looking into the drivers at Square’s third quarter performance. First, we continue to drive growth with larger sellers, gross profit for mid-market sellers is up 22% year-over-year and 39% on a three-year CAGR basis. Our developer tools have helped us serve the needs of larger, more complex sellers, allowing us to grow up markets. During the third quarter, nearly 50% of midmarket GPV was generated by sellers connected to our open developer platform.
Second, we've continued to expand globally and the third quarter GPV from our markets outside the US grew 40% year-over-year, or 55% on a constant currency basis as foreign exchange witnessed significant drag on a year-over-year growth across all international markets. Looking at volume trends by market in the quarter, growth in Australia and Canada remains strong while we saw a macro related slowdown in the UK.
Now to provide an update on our BNPL platform, which we acquired through the Afterpay acquisition. In the third quarter GMV for our BNPL platform was $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year, or 60% on a three-year CAGR basis. For overall growth trends, we've experienced an impact from spend shifts from online to in person, competitive dynamics as well as foreign currency, which slowed year-over-year GMV growth by five points in the third quarter. As we integrate Afterpay, our teams are focused on bridging commerce across Cash App and Square and are making steady progress towards their longer-term vision. On a GAAP basis, revenue for our BNPL platform was up 6% year-over-year growing slower than GMV given mix shifts to enterprise sellers and newer markets. Gross profit was down 3% year-over-year impacted by $12 million in amortization of intangibles within cost of sales. Without this impact, gross profit would have been more in line with revenue growth. Losses on consumer receivables were 0.96% of GMV during the third quarter, an improvement quarter-over-quarter, compared to 1.02% in the second quarter, and an improvement year-over-year. Driven by mix shift as well as enhancements to our risk models and processes during the first half of the year.
We continue to see healthy consumer repayment behavior with more than 95% of installments paid on time. As we enter into 2023, we intend on simplifying many of these disclosures. We don't intend on speaking to our BNPL performance separately once we anniversary the acquisition of Afterpay. And we'll also shift our focus away from three-year CAGR and towards year-over-year growth rates as we lap the onset of the pandemic three years ago.
Next, an update on recent trends on both a year-over-year and three-year CAGR basis, October total gross profit growth is expected -- is estimated to be relatively consistent with the third quarter. In October, we estimate overall company gross profit growth of 37% on a year-over-year basis, including our BNPL platform, or 24% excluding our BNPL platform. We expect fourth quarter gross profit growth to remain relatively consistent with third quarter growth rates on both a year-over-year and three-year CAGR basis at the total company level.
Now let's dig into some of the dynamics by ecosystem. For Cash App, we expect the year-over-year gross profit growth rate to improve in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We saw this play out in October where we estimate Cash App gross profit growth excluding our BNPL platform improved on a year-over-year basis compared to 37% in the third quarter. On a three-year CAGR basis, we expect to see a slight decrease in Cash App’s gross profit growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as we lap the launch of tabs in 2019. Cash App’s gross profit growth in October was driven by growth in active and monetization rates, while inflows per active was relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis. Cash App Card continue to have strong momentum on active and spend per active, which both increased on a year-over-year basis.
For Square, we expect the year-over-year growth rate for gross profit excluding our BNPL platform to moderate in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Given we are now lapping $59 million of non-recurring PPP gross profit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding PPP and our BNPL platform, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth per Square in the fourth quarter to be relatively consistent with the third quarter, which had a 19% year-over-year growth rate with the same exclusions. On a three-year CAGR basis, we expect gross profit growth, excluding our BNPL platform to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Looking at recent volume trends, we estimate square GPV in October was up 16% year-over-year compared to 20% growth in the third quarter, and on a constant currency basis 19% year-over-year as compared to 22% in the third quarter. Trends on a three-year CAGR basis were more stable as we estimate GPV grew by 21% in October compared to 22% in the third quarter.
By region, growth in the US remained relatively stable through October. However, we've seen a meaningful slowdown in year-over-year GPV growth in our international markets primarily driven by foreign exchange rates, and to a lesser extent the ongoing macro related slowdown in the UK. In October, we estimate that international GPV was up 23% year-over-year or 44% on a constant currency basis. Moving to our planned investments for the fourth quarter of 2022. While our business trends have remained stable through October, we have been increasingly focused on our spend amidst an uncertain macro environment. We plan to reduce our investments for the full year 2022 by an additional $140 million, which brings the total pullback on our planned non-GAAP operating expenses on the year to $519 million, or approximately 25% of our expected step up entering the year.
For the first quarter, we expect to increase non-GAAP operating expenses by $206 million compared to the third quarter. Looking ahead to 2023, we are still in the process of finalizing our plans for next year. And while we aren't quite ready to share specifics, we wanted to give you a sense of how we're thinking about next year. Over the past several years, we've significantly grown our business and our expense base. Looking to 2023, we're focused on operating more efficiently, and we expect to slow our pace of expense growth meaningfully compared to prior years. Based on our preliminary plans, our outlook includes a slowdown across several areas of our discretionary expenses, a continuation of the discipline you've seen from us in recent quarters, in particular two areas to underscore. First, hiring. Headcount makes up the largest driving -- driver of our expense base. In 2023, we expect to significantly moderate our pace of hiring compared to recent years, which will benefit our financial results on a lag with greater leverage on headcount costs expected in the back half of 2023 and into 2024.
Second, sales and marketing. In 2023, we intend on pulling back on lower ROI, more experimental areas, including brand and awareness spend across both our Square and Cash App ecosystems, and continue investing in channels with more proven ROI. Outside of these 1/3 of our non-GAAP operating expenses include variable expenses, which have historically grown more in line with overall gross profit, including transaction and loan losses, peer to peer costs, Cash App Card issuance costs and expenses related to data and our platform infrastructure. We continue to see a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and we're prepared to be dynamic with our spend as we see the macro environment play out, both investing more when we see returns and pulling back with lower or uncertain returns as we've done in the past. We'd love to share more on our approach for the coming year in our fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Ultimately, we remain focused on balancing growth and profitability in this environment. We want to operate with efficiency and agility in 2023 and beyond with an increasing focus on not only top line growth, but also profitability across both adjusted EBITDA and profit metrics that factor in stock-based compensation, where we intend on driving leverage over time.
To conclude, as we enter an uncertain macro environment, our agility means we can track our business trends in real time across a diverse set of products and customers. And make strategic decisions quickly to support our customers and adapt to the changes we observed. With that, we'll open it up to your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Thank you, nice to see the strong revenue, gross profit and EBITDA here. So just want to build on what you just talked about there. I'm really just thinking ahead. I know you're not going to give too much specific guidance for fiscal ‘23. But is it reasonable to expect that Block is now in a position to show some operating leverage in ‘23, given the less certain macro, and you've invested quite a bit, it looks like you're getting good returns since the bottom of the pandemic here, but can we get back to operating leverage when we get back to ‘23? Thank you. Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. We are focused on driving long term profitable growth at scale. And what that means for us is that we're going to balance growth and margins in our investment framework. As you note, given the significant growth of our business, we've grown our investments over the past few years to create products and marketing engines that help us drive that top line growth paired with profitable unit economics across both of our ecosystems. Our preliminary 2023 plans really significantly moderate those expense -- that expense growth as we focus on balancing growth and profitability. Longer term we do -- we will continue to moderate that expense growth to drive increased operating efficiency, profitability. And specifically for Cash App, we do expect to see operating leverage next year.
We'll have more to say in February, of course, as we're still in our planning stages across the business. Our focus ultimately is on agility. As the environment continues to evolve here, we want to remain agile and be able to adapt to what we're seeing. And we intend on maintaining the discipline that you've seen so far this year with a pullback in discretionary operating expenses, particularly in those areas that are less efficient, or conversely leaned in areas where we are seeing attractive returns and that enable us to grow our business in a profitable way over time. We've proven that ability to kind of dial back expenses in real time so far this year, we pulled back almost $600 million, about 10% of our planned OpEx space, or 25% of the step up, where we haven't seen returns or where the returns are less certain in order to deliver more near-term profitability. That gives us the confidence in our ability to continue to invest in and help us determine how much is needed to drive that next incremental dollar of growth and where we should be prioritizing investment over time. Your next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up that call out in your shareholder letter and the prepared remarks about the 18 million monthly Cash App Card users, you now have 35% of total monthly active. Can you elaborate a bit on the nature of the cash card users? So for example, do you have a sense for how many cash card users you now have using the cash card as their primary debit card? Or like are these banks consumers? Or is this their primary bank accounts? And what steps are you taking to kind of keep building out the wallet share of those cash card users? I think you had highlighted at Investor Day they drive something like five times as much gross profit as non-cash card user. Thank you. Hey, Lisa. Thanks for the question. I can kick off here. Driving product adoption for us across our banking products is one of our primary focus areas within our Cash App pillar around financial services. And we've experienced strong attach rates here. These financial services products allow us to really deepen our relationship with our customers beyond just peer to peer and serve them more holistically related to their finances. So specifically for Cash App Card as 18 million monthly actives in September growing 20%, sorry growing strongly and now growing in terms of attach at 35% of our monthly active during the month. And also with strong engagement in September Cash App Card actives made 16 purchases during the month on average. So we're seeing our customers using their card on average every other day, and really with broad based utility with customers spending across a diverse range of use cases, gas and utilities, restaurants and grocery, various retailers. And with spend that's increased over time on a per user basis. So in the third quarter spend per active grew on a year-over-year basis, bringing where as we see our customers bringing more of their spend to Cash App Card.
And as Jack noted, Cash App Card customers accounted for about half of overall inflows into Cash App, to your point about the importance of this customer base to our ecosystem. And these customers have also significantly higher monetization rates compounding together as they bring more inflows at a higher monetization rate, to drive even greater gross profit from this Cash App Card customer cohort. Maybe the final thing that I'd say here is that Cash App Card is an important way for us to bring Cash App to greater top of mind from a financial services perspective, certainly top of wallet for our customers, bigger part of a core offering as we graduate our customers from peer to peer into the ease of use of our financial services products. And we see that really resonating with younger demographics, but also as a way to drive greater adoption into other banking products like direct deposit, where we've now eliminated the friction of allowing customers to create a direct deposit account the moment, they sign up for Cash App Card and which has, though it's still early days, is meaningfully increase the adoption of direct deposit as well for us. So it's important in and of itself, but also important as the gateway to adopting other baking products within Cash App. I'll just say to your question, we don't have the data on whether we're primarily against other credit cards or other banks. But that is certainly our goal. And I think we have a better strategy over the over the long term. In that we're not just a card, we're not just savings, or other features that we offer, including the Discover tab to find commerce, Bitcoin, stocks, deposits, people and peer to peer, obviously, which is the easiest way to send money to anyone. People come in for various different reasons, and they will find our other services. And ideally, those services resonate even more. And our goal, at first is to be first consideration for any one of these services, including the Cash App Card. But over time, we want to work towards being primary because everything that you need in your financial life, you can find within Cash App Card. So that is the goal, that's what we're focused on. And I think we have the best strategy to get there. We have Ali Kennis, square seller dialing in to ask a question. Hi, Jack, thanks so much for taking my question. My name is Ali and I own Sugar Lab Bake Shop in Ventura, California. We've been using Square to run operations at Sugar Lab for the last 10 years, which is as long as we've been in business. We have grown to over 45 employees over the years not currently. But we do use several Square software and hardware products, including stand, point of sale, marketing, loyalty, savings, payroll, and more. Pretty much everything. And then I'm also a Square super seller. So my question is, as the tight labor market continues in the food industry, we have fewer bakers and kitchen staff this year, how can Square help us prepare to handle the seasonal rush, and what are ways in which I can attract talent in time for the holidays, especially given that we're competing with larger businesses. Thank you, and congrats on your business. I think that I think the biggest thing here is anything that we can do from a technology perspective, to give you time back first and foremost, to make sure that you're not wasting a bunch of time looking up different systems and fiddling with interface that all the solutions we provide are intuitive, and they get easier and easier and potentially even more automated. So that you can focus more on what you have and doing a whole lot more with less. So that is the first part and we're focused a lot on that internally. But there are also products that will take some of the workload off you such as self-serve ordering and Square payrolls on demand pay, and also making it much more efficient for your employees. So our team management product, I don't know if you've used that yet. We've -- we focus a lot of energy on making sure that the team and the employees and your 45 Sugar state where it could be quite useful that they have all the information they need to help you operate and run the business very efficiently. All of these things that we're doing today, we're going to continue to improve with more automation, more artificial intelligence that you can turn on and off and really make informed decisions around how you run your business. And as you continue to grow your business becomes more and more attractive to more people. So by focusing on your customers, and making sure that you have your time focus entirely on that instead of all the operational capacities or needs of your business, which is where we come in your business gets more successful, more people want to join. So thank you for using Square and keep at it. Your next question comes from line up Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Hey, guys, thanks. Look, just following up a little more on Cash App, the combination of monthly active users shrank continues as well as the gross profit, looks like attach rates to card was a key part. But if you could just remind us on what you see is the real opportunity there in terms of attach rates on different products and what really what the path is for ARPU when layering in not only what you've already done them in sort of the financial services side, but also what kind of opportunity pay with cash can be and how the progress is going there, too. Thanks, guys. Hey, Darrin, thanks for the question. So let me start with kind of where we are in terms of ARPU, which is another metric you can measure along with the overall influence frameworks, and then talk about where some of our product priorities to, based on where we're driving key elements of the inflows framework forward. So from an ARPU perspective gross profit per active, excluding the BNPL platform was $57, in the third quarter, up from $53, in the second and $50 in the first quarter. So we are continuing to see growth there, in part driven by our monetization rate, in part driven by the increased utilization of the platform strong engagement on the Cash App platform. If you break that down across our inflows framework, what we look at is actives, where we've continued to see strong growth inflows per active, which we've seen continued stability, despite now lapping some of the significant government disbursements and even some of the seasonal tax benefits from the first half of this year.
And then monetization rate where as I said we have some products where we can flex our pricing. In some products, where we are driving engagement and driving utilization. That inflows framework is really clarifying for us in terms of our product roadmap, and where we see the traction across each of those variables. And so there's three top product development pillars that I'd call out our financial services, network growth and trust in terms of being able to continue to drive the Cash App platform forward. From a financial services perspective, as you've noted, we've seen growing adoption here, and that's a key -- top priority for us in 2023, to see continued adoption of these products, across not only Cash App Card and direct deposit, where there's a lot more for us to do there, strong traction, but continued runway ahead, but also through some of the newer products that are continuing to take hold like Cash App Pay, as you noted, where we see 60% of Cash App Pay volumes are now from customers who aren't active in Cash App Card, showing that strong brand affinity for our products, beyond even a strong attached product, like Cash App Card. And also for products like Cash App Card Borrow which we're still in the early days of ramping and where we've seen strong growth with profitable unit economics.
From a network growth perspective, our priorities here is using our core differentiator, which is the network effects inherent in Cash App to really bring customer engagement out and enable our customers to engage more with their network and with each other, including bringing others from their network into Cash App. And then from a trust perspective we've evolved relatively quickly from a peer-to-peer app into a financial services app. And trust in our platform is extremely important, as customers bring more of their money into the app. And so that's another key focus for us as we drive our inflows framework forward and ultimately, as we drive ARPU forward as well. Your next question is from line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Great, thank you for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about Cash App customer acquisition costs. So it's taking us back actually to a comment that you made last quarter. You mentioned that CAC was relatively stable versus 2021, which was at the time you had mentioned the $10 blended CAC number so we were a little bit surprised to hear that that simply because you've been moving more towards building density with higher income customers and making the direct deposit push, and we would have expected that to maybe come up a little bit, if you could just talk about what some of the offsets have been, how you've been able to contain those customer acquisition costs, clearly the peer to peer network is a part of it, but maybe some of the other drivers boost Afterpay. And then broadly to the extent you can, if you could give us an update on gross adds and churn trends for the Cash App base overall. Hey, Tim, I can kick us off here. Thanks for the question. We've continued to see relative efficiency in terms of our sales and marketing spend here, with a cost of acquisition for net new actives in line, continue to be in line with what we saw in 2020, and ’21 as you note in that $10, sort of customer acquisition cost range. We are looking to drive new demographics; we are looking to drive higher product adoption at the start with our new customers. And we are looking to bring in higher lifetime value customers. We're seeing some of that play out now in some of the trends that you've seen today, including across the financial services, offerings, Cash App Card and some of those core offerings that have become a bigger part of our product adoption earlier on in the customers lifecycle. We're pairing, we are being disciplined in our spend. We're focused on the channels that we have the most confidence in and in driving the greatest returns, and are prepared to be flexible on that moving forward. Ultimately, we think there's a tremendous opportunity from an actives perspective to continue our growth here. If you think about digital natives, Gen Z millennial customers, though they make up a significant portion of Cash App customers, we are still only penetrated into 20% of Gen Z and Millennial customers as the US population. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, this is the fastest growing demographic for us in monthly actives over the past few years. But there's so much more we can do here to bring the other 80% in the Cash App over time too. Your next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Great, thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could expand on the inflows strategy for Cash App. It was really encouraging to hear the stable inflows per active despite the tough comps. And I believe that the year-over-year declines in July. So could you talk a little bit about things on the roadmap to drive inflows and direct deposit actives for next year for instance? Are there any meaningful improvements to drive engagement on Cash App taxes for next spring? And then as a quick follow up, I was just wondering if you could update us on the direct deposit monthly actives number. I think that was one and a half at the beginning of the year. Thank you. Sure, I'm happy to get started maybe with framing up our inflows framework, and then we'll dive into some of the greater detail on direct deposit. So the inflows framework, again, active inflows per active monetization rate, you can think of the key drivers as inflows per active being the spending power of our customers, and then our share of wallet of our customers. And so there's sort of two variables for us to think about. They're both in terms of the customers that make up the mix of customers on our platform, and then our ability to engage those customers across our products. What we've seen in the third quarter, as continued stability and enclosed per active at over $1,000. But growth on a three-year CAGR basis at 17%, which we've seen for most of this year, that growth in the mid-teens, is really encouraging healthy trends across our Cash App customer base. Even as we move past those periods of stimulus and tax refunds, we think ultimately, there's so much more room to grow these inflows per active number by having multiple inflow channels, and cross selling more of our products to our customers, specifically, these financial services products like Cash App Card and direct deposit. And with direct deposit as we noted $2 billion in September of direct deposit volumes, those volumes grew by more than 65% year-over-year in September, as we've begun to reduce the friction on account creation after customers sign up for their Cash App Card. So this is a key focus for us as we continue with our strategy of enabling our banking products to our customers, Cash Up Card a big part of it, direct deposit, another key part of it, and as a result, direct deposit plus paper money deposit, which is another inflow channel we've opened up, growing as a share of total inflows making up more than 14% of inflows in September versus 9% a year ago. Sorry, I just wanted to follow up there. In terms of the roadmap ahead, a lot of what you saw with what we did over the past year with the navigation is meant to exactly bring more of this to life, so that it's even more accessible, and easier to find how to turn on direct deposit. For instance, if you get a Cash App Card now you instantly have a direct deposit number. So there's a number of things we can do to optimize for what we're doing in the interface itself, so that people are more aware that we have this offering in the first place. And we will continue to add features and products that also coexist with existing ones that people are using. We have to keep in mind that a lot of people in Cash App start with this very simple, I receive money from a friend or family member or I want to send money to a friend or family member. And then it's our opportunity to really showcase everything else we have to offer, including the Cash App Card, including direct deposit, including Cash App taxes, and the easier we make that and the more tips we add in the interface, the more compelling the outcome we will have. Your next question comes from line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious to understand the progress you've made in combining two powerful ecosystems Cash App Pay and Afterpay. How is organic growth of Cash App trended and what are the next steps for full integration here? Yes, so our big focus here is on commerce. And linking our two ecosystems through Afterpay is the most compelling option that we found in the market. We believe that this is a perfect blend of everything that we can offer to sellers, including a way for them to drive more sales, and also new discovery and new opportunities for customers, which also helps them discover Square merchants and merchants all around the world, especially when you consider online commerce and digital commerce. So our long-term vision is to build a more dynamic checkout experience, which enables a much more fluid checkout than what you see today. We recently introduced the Discover tab in a Cash App. See this as a complete start. Our goal here was to introduce people to the concept, we're not there yet, with the experience. Think of this as more of a search engine that we're trying to optimize and iterate super-fast on to make sure that when people go there, they're looking for something or we can display relevant content based on their location. And it gets more and more efficient, more effective, and ultimately leads to a purchase. So that is our goal. We're just starting a lot of that work right now. And we intend to make it a place that is instantly relevant over time. And this will take some time. But this is a -- this will really unlock a lot of what we hope to unlock in both the Cash App ecosystem and the Square ecosystem and be beneficial to our Square sellers. But also more broadly for the Cash App customers as well. Your next question is from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Great, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask a follow up on margins, particularly in seller or Square is with more of the growth they're coming from larger merchants and then international, which I think both are higher CAC. How should we think of the growth versus margin trade off there if there is one? Is there still more that you need to do to invest behind either those markets, whether it's the salesforce or brand marketing, just trying to get it ultimately what you expect the margin impact to be over time as the mix continues to skew more towards international and larger sellers. Thanks so much. Hey, Trevor, I can kick off here. So look, our Square business is a fairly high structural margin business as we shared at Investor Day at a 69% structural margin in 2021. We can take a significant portion of every dollar of top line growth drops down to profitability, where we are orienting our priorities is where we are seeing the strongest returns in terms of our growth, whether it's omni channel products, moving upmarket, with larger sellers, our mid-market sellers are now 40% of our GPV, growing at 22%, year-over-year, and international, which also growing 40%. And some of the key products that underpin growth with larger sellers, like critical points of sale, growing at 45%, year-over-year, so each of those strategic priorities for our Square business that we're investing behind, are driving stronger growth in the overall base.
Now, we expect in 2023 to moderate the pace of some of our investments across sales and marketing and product development in order to continue to that balance that growth and profitability as we spoke about earlier whether it's across hiring, sales and marketing, where we would be pulling back on some of that brand marketing, and have a stable to increasing mix of our investments on things like sales teams, as we focus on optimization. And as we focus on building with our upmarket sellers, bringing more of those larger sellers onto our platform, as well as our product development investments, where we're really expanding the reach of our platform and the cohesiveness of our platform. So we can take the work off our sellers’ plates and focus on some of the key products that are truly resonating, as you hear today, the vertical solutions, the developer platform, or omni channel software.
So those are some of the key focus areas for us, of course, we want to remain agile with our spend and be responsive to what we see in a potentially changing macro environment. But we are seeing traction in the areas where we are most strategically oriented. Your next question is from line of Josh Beck with KeyBanc. Thanks for taking the question. I have actually a follow up along those lines as well. For the Square stellar business, obviously, you made a pretty substantial investment last year, in outbound sales, you've obviously had more time to see the payback and obviously, blend that with the other go to market strategy. So as you look forward to ‘23 based on how the lessons that you've learned, how important is that outbound motion within the Square go to market. Hey, Josh, happy to double click on this and maybe I'll address more broadly our go-to-market approach for the Square business. So our focus, maintaining target paybacks of about a six-quarter payback, and target returns of about 3x ROI as we evolve our go-to-market strategy to support the growth of market. Throughout 2022, we pull back on some of the lower ROI areas, and we calibrated our spending mix to the channels with more proven ROI. So what does that look like across each of the areas? From a sales perspective, we're focused on optimizing our sales channel, which was more predictable returns and where we have the ability to measure performance, we believe our sales team, it will ultimately be a long-term core engine of growth for the business. And there's kind of three key strategies for enhancing our growth up market using our sales team.
One is the verticalization as a team, so creating pods around specific verticals, retail restaurant services, where you see we are gaining traction with our vertical points of sale today to enable those account executives to go deeper, and the needs that are specific to each of those verticals. Second, expanding our outbound sourcing capabilities, so that we can reach out and make sure that these larger sellers have a better understanding of all the many things that Square can do for them today. And then third, introducing more automation into our tooling to enable our sales team to have better information as they're reaching out to the sellers, which ultimately then can help drive greater efficiency.
From an international perspective, our four most tenured international markets are pacing at these healthy payback periods that we're targeting. Our three more recently launched markets in the last 18 months do have longer payback periods, whether we're looking at it end marketing or sales, as we're introducing our ecosystem into those markets, and building our awareness. From a performance marketing perspective, this is really the core engine which continues to drive stable proven returns and historically has been a significant driver of acquisition. So that's really giving you an orientation of our overall go-to-market efforts with sales is a key piece of that. Your next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Hi, thank you so much for taking my question tonight. I wanted to ask about convertible solutions and whether there is a long-term roadmap to expand the number of verticals that you support. And then separately, I just wanted to ask Amrita about the potential to maybe more actively leverage the customer account balances to drive more fluid income. It looks like you guys used to keep more cash, more funds in the money market versus sitting in cash. I'm just curious if that's something that we could see more of in the future to drive some interest income. Thanks. So yes, there are three vertical point of sales right now. And services are Square for Restaurant, Square for Retail and Appointments. We're always looking for opportunities to first and foremost, expand these and add more features, add more services to each one, to continue to make sure that we're serving the need for the particular service, but also looking for other opportunities for more vertical services. But first and foremost, it's making sure that we remain competitive, and we're ahead in terms of our feature set, and making sure that we're continuing to work to optimize these services for our customers. The other thing that we've talked about in the past on these calls is one trend we continue to see is that the vertical aspects of these things tend to blur a little bit, we see restaurants adding retail like services and appointment type businesses adding or merging with like restaurant type services or retail as well.
So the benefit of our ecosystem is we're not focused on just one. We're focused on all three and more generally, how you operate a business, how you operate, operate a team, and ensuring that we're giving you tools no matter what business you choose to be in to make the sale and make more sales ultimately. So that is our goal. Every day answering the question, how do we help sellers make more sales. In some cases, these vertical efforts make more sense. But the most compelling trend that we're -- that we continue to see is the blending of all these things. And that's where our ecosystem mindset really shows us strength. And, Ramsey, just to follow up on your question on float or interest income, the majority of our cash in our customer funds is variable to interest rate fluctuations via a pretty diversified portfolio of accounts, the vast majority of which are relatively short term, which allows us to capitalize on increasing yields. So in the third quarter, interest income increased as a result of obviously higher interest rates. And we expect to continue to benefit as some of -- as many of our investments lag on interest income pickup, just to maybe break that down for you across our corporate balance sheet and customer funds. From a corporate balance sheet standpoint, interest income was $15 million in the third quarter. That's up from you $9 million in the second, $8 million and the first, majority of our cash here is variable as I said that interest rate fluctuations either via fixed income, T bills, government money, market accounts or non-interest-bearing accounts that earn an earnings credit rate and much of that interest income -- this interest income flows through to the interest income and expense line which is below the EBITDA line.
From a customer funds standpoint, Cash App customer funds does generate interest income as well. We had $7 million in the third quarter up from less than a million in each of the first and second quarters. Majority of these funds are invested in very short-term accounts and money market accounts and they flow through Cash App revenue and gross profit lines. Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist securities. Hi, good afternoon. Appreciate you squeezing me in here toward the end. I wanted to ask about the Square business and the competitive environment and how much of the growth is coming from competitive takeaways? Who are the companies that you generally see at the point of sale? How much is net new business creation? Just trying to get a sense of kind of the way the markets evolving competitively and how you think you're positioned? Hey, Andrew, maybe I can kick us off here. What we see is stability in our trend lines. it's a -- it'll depend on each product as to who our competitors are. We don't see a competitor out there who has a threat that we have across our ecosystem. And really, it's that diversity of products, vertical channels and customer types that we have that we believe is the most resilient, particularly as we may be entering a volatile time from the macro perspective. So what we have saw in the Square ecosystem through October is relative stability, from Q3 and October, or to into Q4, with GPV through October, in the US, and particularly for some of those discretionary verticals, which we are paying particularly close attention to, retail, restaurant, services on a three-year CAGR basis, with stability.
Now, of course, from an international perspective we don't see this as a necessarily competitive issue. But from a FX perspective, we're seeing some headwinds there, as are many other companies. And from a macro perspective, as we noted in the UK, but more broadly, when you look at the Square ecosystem, ex PPP, as we noted, which was a non-recurring benefit in Q4, and ex BNPL, we see stable rates of year-over-year growth in Square gross profit from Q3 into Q4. And again from a competitive perspective, we believe we're fairly differentiated given the diversity of customer types and product types that we serve. Yes, I would say that I'm, generally there's certainly areas across our verticals or across some of our products, where we're behind competition. And somewhere we're ahead but on the net, I think as Amrita said, we're much further ahead over the long term, because of that ecosystem mindset. And because of the breadth of the tools that we offer, and most importantly, how easily they integrate together. It's literally a button push to turn things on or off. And that includes a wide array of services from lending to customer relationship management to vertical points of sale, to hardware. So this is where I think things really matter is a business no longer has to go vendor to vendor to vendor, but they can come to one place, they can come to Square, and they see pretty much everything they need.
It does mean that we are going to be slightly slower in rolling out all the features for each one particular vertical. But it also balances that with a much higher quality of integration, which ultimately ends up taking a whole ton of, it gives a whole ton of time back to the seller. So that we see much, much better retention than a lot of our peers.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements, other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include discussions of our long-term targets and goals, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and we may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary estimates of gross profit growth performance for the month of January and February. These represent our current estimate for January and February performance as we have not yet finalized our financial statements for the months of January and February, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual January and February results may differ from these estimates.
Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by, and is the responsibility of management. This preliminary financial information has not been reviewed or audited by our independent public accounting firm. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for January and February or the first quarter.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter and Investor Day materials on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. During our last earnings call, we committed to sharing our investment framework. We'll spend the majority of our interim remarks on that instead of a review of our last quarter, which you'll find in our shareholder letter we sent out about an hour ago.
There are three principles guiding our investment framework. Number one, ensure our investments are focused on customer retention and growth; number two, account for ongoing cost of the business, including stock-based compensation; and number three, utilize industry standard conventions that are simple to communicate and to understand.
Using these principles, our investment framework can be articulated in a single sentence. Block, in each of our ecosystems, must show a believable path to gross profit retention of over 100% and Rule of 40 on adjusted operating income. This is an ambitious goal, especially at our scale, and one we aren't meeting today.
We're sharing this today to provide full transparency into how we want to drive the business, and how we want to be held accountable.
In the coming quarters, we'll provide more details into our strategies and plans for how we're moving the company towards achieving this goal. I wanted to take a moment to share why we believe this is so important, before Amrita dives into where we are today and what it means for operating our business. Our ability to retain a customer over time tells us a lot. It says, we found product market fit, we have the right set of services and features, we're providing the right customer support, we're able to efficiently cross-sell into more products, and we have the right pricing.
In the simplest terms, it means that our customers find value in our offerings and want to stick with us. Historically, both Cash App and Square have delivered positive gross profit retention. We may not achieve this in every period due to macro shifts. For instance, we saw Square's retention dip in 2020 due to the pandemic, before recovering the next year. But over the long term, we expect the average annual gross profit retention of our ecosystems to be above 100%.
To complement retention, we'll continue to measure customer cohort economics, to assess each stage of the customer journey. We assess our efforts to efficiently attract new customers by looking at returns on investment, a factor of both growing customer lifetime value and appropriately aligning our customer acquisition costs. Together, the combination of efficient acquisition and retention leads to greater gross profit growth for our ecosystems.
Turning now to the second component of our investment framework, which is Rule of 40. We want to further raise the bar on our growth rates and our efficiency. We believe measuring our ecosystems on growth plus margins is the best framework to enable this. A growth plus margin framework provides flexibility for products and businesses at different stages of maturity. It's a useful and universal formula for evaluating each of our ecosystems with different growth trends and margin profiles today, and for those we might launch in the future.
It also ensures accountability. When we increase our investments, this framework forces us to think critically about the expected returns. And if growth slows, it encourages us to adapt, to operate with more discipline or to pursue different investments. It pushes us to think creatively using new technologies or distribution models to create efficiencies and do more with less. Historically, we have looked at gross profit growth plus adjusted EBITDA margins.
In 2022, Block's gross profit growth plus adjusted EBITDA margin was 52%, and or 42% when excluding Afterpay, which provided a onetime benefit to growth last year. While adjusted EBITDA margin is one of the key profit disclosures we focused on in the past, we recognize it excludes certain expenses like stock-based compensation, which is a real meaningful ongoing cost to operating our business. It isn't a cash expense, but it's a real expense. So we're going to include it in how we assess our investments and performance. And to do so, we are developing better signals around it. As a result, we're shifting our focus to an adjusted operating income margin.
With this metric, profit margins will include certain noncash expenses like stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. With the Rule of 40, we are targeting the sum of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margins to be at or above 40% over the long term. This target applies to Block at the overall company level, as well as each of our ecosystems. By comparison, for 2022, Block's gross profit growth plus adjusted operating income margin was 33% or 23% excluding Afterpay.
Finally, we want to be able to communicate this in a way that's easy to understand, using methods that have been widely accepted by the investment community.
Gross profit retention and the Rule of 40 targets are both clear and balance each other in a way that aligns our customer interest with those of our investors. They provide a clear way for us to determine what's working and what's not working as we seek to serve more and more customers around the world.
We believe this investment framework will ultimately enhance our ecosystem around the world in our ecosystem model by allowing each business to make holistic decisions around their teams and road maps in parallels. It ensures the quick decisions of one ecosystem will constrain the others. And this model will help us move quicker and be more dynamic with our investments to grow Block overall.
And this framework has already informed some decisions for us. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we're consolidating our corporate teams, people, legal and finance in a one organization that Amrita will lead as our Chief Operating Officer. This will allow us to be far more focused and efficient as we work to achieve our goals. Amrita will continue to serve as our CFO as well.
So now, over to Amrita, our COO. Thanks, Jack. I'll start with how we're executing against our investment framework before moving to our expectations for 2023 and recent trends. Let's start with gross profit retention. We are a customer-led company, and gross profit retention is an effective way to reflect this. In 2022, Cash App and Square experienced positive gross profit retention compared to 2021, which is in line with our long-term target that Jack outlined.
We measure gross profit retention on a net basis, factoring in gross profit growth from existing customers as they increase engagement or adopt more products, net of any churn from customers who leave our ecosystem. It's a similar definition to the net revenue retention metric many other companies use, but adapted to our main top line metric, which is gross profit.
We look at retention alongside broader cohort economics to both assess the health of the customer base and our ability to efficiently acquire new customers. In 2022, we experienced strong returns on acquisition spend, which gives us confidence in our ability to invest for long-term profitable growth.
For Cash App, in 2022, we achieved an efficient cost of acquisition of $10 or less on average, as we grew to 51 million monthly transacting actives in December, adding our largest annual cohort of customers on a gross profit basis. Our historical Cash App cohorts through 2020 have achieved ROIs of 6x or greater over three years, while our most recent annual cohorts in 2021 and 2022 are at or pacing at an estimated payback of less than one year.
For Square, each of our annual cohorts onboarded through 2020 are at or pacing at an estimated ROI of 3x or greater over four years with our 2021 and 2022 cohorts pacing at an estimated payback of six quarters or less. There are periods over the past year where expected paybacks on our 2022 Square cohort stretched beyond our six quarter target, primarily because of increased spend in our international markets and experimental areas.
We then pulled back on these areas and are now seeing paybacks trend in line again with our targets. In 2023, we're focused on refining Square's go-to-market approach and strengthening our sales and marketing motion. Taken together, we believe these fundamentals of positive retention, efficient acquisition and strong returns on acquisition spend drive sustainable business models.
Moving to our long-term goal of Rule of 40. We expect our path to achieving this 40% growth plus adjusted operating income margin benchmark will be driven by a few key areas of opportunity.
From a growth perspective, we're just getting started. We have less than 5% share of a nearly $200 billion gross profit opportunity across our addressable markets, with much of the landscape sitting on legacy infrastructure. We'll continue to invest with discipline to unlock growth in each of our ecosystems.
For Square and Cash App, this includes launching new products for our customers, expanding into new customer segments and refining our go-to-market approach across our global audiences. For our emerging businesses, our principles are the same, though at an earlier stage. We're constraining investment for these businesses to less than 3% of operating expenses in 2023 in aggregate, and we'll look for these ecosystems to show a path to achieving and sustaining Rule of 40.
From a margin perspective, key opportunities include finding greater efficiencies and share-based compensation and our overhead expenses. We intend on slowing our pace of hiring across the company in 2023. Within our overhead expenses, we plan to drive leverage across our software and data consumption, real estate footprint, professional fees and other discretionary areas.
Within our reporting disclosures, we want to bring more transparency to our performance against these targets and intend on introducing new disclosures around profitability on an adjusted operating income basis and sharing more about segment-level profitability for Square and Cash App over time. Our priority remains driving long-term profitable growth at scale, and we believe this balance of compounding growth and margins will help us achieve this.
Now let's shift gears to look at our plans for 2023. Over the past several years, we've significantly grown our business and our expense base. We're focused on operating with efficiency in 2023 and expect to slow our pace of expense growth meaningfully compared to prior years. We expect to deliver approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023 for a growth of more than 30% and at least 1 point of margin expansion year-over-year.
On an adjusted operating income basis, we are targeting a loss of approximately $150 million for 2023 and expect our adjusted operating income margin to modestly improve year-over-year. This incorporates the run rate of trends we've observed in our business up until earnings and our current estimates for performance through February.
In 2023, we expect Cash App to expand its margins on a year-over-year basis, while we expect Square's margins to be relatively consistent year-over-year. While this is our base case entering the year, we recognize that we are in an uncertain macro environment. Amidst this uncertainty, we intend to hold to our stated profit targets for 2023. If growth slows, we'll exercise discipline and look for cost initiatives to pull back within our planned expense base.
As we shared on our last earnings call, we are moderating spend in our two biggest discretionary areas. First, hiring. Headcount makes up the largest driver of our expense base. In 2023, we expect to increase our headcount by 10% compared to the prior year period, a significant change compared to 46% growth in 2022. However, given the pace of hiring last year, we expect overall personnel expenses to increase in the mid-20% range year-over-year, with greater leverage on headcount costs expected in the back half of 2023 and into 2024.
Second, sales and marketing. We expect overall sales and marketing growth to be 5% to 10% year-over-year in 2023, moderating compared to approximately 25% in the prior year period. Breaking this line item down, we expect variable Cash App expenses, including peer-to-peer costs and Cash App Card issuance costs to grow faster. And the remaining portion of our sales and marketing expenses across the business to be relatively consistent with the prior year, as we drive efficiency on acquisition spend.
Consistent with our remarks last quarter, we'll continue investing in channels with more proven ROI and intend on pulling back in other go-to-market areas.
As we shared last quarter, about one-third of our overall non-GAAP operating expense base is made up of variable expenses, which have historically grown more in line with overall gross profit. These not only include peer-to-peer costs and Cash App Card issuance costs in sales and marketing, but also transaction and losses and expenses related to data and our platform infrastructure.
Next, an update on recent trends and some highlights from the fourth quarter. For the month of January and February, we estimate overall company gross profit growth to be approximately 33% year-over-year on a reported basis, and we expect growth for the full first quarter to be a few points below this.
As a reminder, we are now lapping the acquisition of Afterpay, which closed on January 31, 2022. And as a result, our reported growth rate for January should be greater than that of February and March. If we look at our performance on a combined company basis, which would include a $51 million contribution from our BNPL platform to January 2022 results, we see stable to improving trends. In particular, we see an improvement in January and February gross profit growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On a combined company basis, we estimate overall company gross profit growth in January and February of approximately 25% year-over-year, an improvement from 21% in the fourth quarter. And we expect a combined company growth rate of 25% in January and February to be relatively stable for the full first quarter.
We have continued to see the diversity of our ecosystem model provide resilience in this dynamic environment. Through January and February, Cash App saw continued strength with stable consumer trends. Square saw some moderation in growth rates for certain discretionary verticals with greater stability in other verticals.
Let's get into some of these trends by ecosystem. As a reminder, gross profit includes a 50% allocation from our BNPL platform across each of Square and Cash App. For Cash App, we expect gross profit growth to be greater than 50% on a reported basis year-over-year for the months of January and February. In March, we expect gross profit growth to slow as we lap pricing changes made in the prior year period. Cash App's early momentum this year has been a continuation of our strong fourth quarter. We continue to build out our banking offering by introducing savings, which has been one of our fastest-growing products on Cash App.
Cash App Card achieved strong growth in monthly actives and spend per active and delivered more than $750 million in gross profit for the year, up 56% year-over-year and making up more than one-quarter of overall Cash App gross profit.
For Square, we expect gross profit growth to be approximately 15% on a reported basis year-over-year through January and February. Looking at recent volume trends, we saw a moderation in the GPV growth rates for discretionary verticals in the US beginning in November, primarily for food and drink and retail. And we have seen these trends continue into the first quarter. Even with these shifts in macro trend line, the Square ecosystem, excluding PPP and our BNPL platform had a gross profit growth rate of 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and is expected to grow 21% year-over-year in January and February. As a reminder, for the full first quarter of 2022, we recognized $51 million of nonrecurring PPP gross profit.
And lastly, an update on our BNPL platform, which was also embedded in the figures I just noted for Cash App and Square. Through the months of January and February, we expect GMV growth of 19% year-over-year, an improvement compared to 14% growth in the fourth quarter.
We have been encouraged by our ability to manage loss rates, as losses on consumer receivables remained below 1% during the fourth quarter and improved on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis behind consistent repayment trends. In the first quarter, loss rates typically see a seasonal increase compared to other quarters, though are expected to remain around 1% for the first quarter.
To conclude, our potential is profound across our significant addressable opportunity, the ability to grow with our existing customers and the longer-term path to grow new ecosystems. With all this opportunity, we have found that constraints are clarifying and can help us execute responsibly and creatively. With the components of our investment framework, we believe our teams will be able to continue driving product velocity, while prioritizing agility, accountability and long-term thinking paired with near-term feedback loops.
With that, we'll open it up to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, thanks so much. I like the investment framework, especially the adjusted operating income margin. I think it will be well received. So, I wanted to ask on that, if you don't mind, just focusing on the margin and cost side which you have more control over. Can you just discuss or talk about the broader opportunity for operating leverage longer term? I know, you gave some thoughts for '23. But just beyond that operating leverage overall or maybe even across the two ecosystems, how should we think about that? Thanks. Thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. I'll start us off. Our investment framework here is -- around Rule of 40 is really about helping to build profitable long-term growth. And just as important as achieving Rule of 40 is a staying Rule of 40. So we're looking to make investments in our business, that can accrete returns both for our customers and ultimately for us and for our business model.
From a leverage perspective, specifically to your question, there are a couple of key things that we're looking at that I'd point you to in terms of opportunities for us to find increased leverage across our fixed expense base. The first key areas that we're looking at are hiring and sales and marketing. As you heard on the call today, we're meaningfully slowing the pace of our hiring, growing about 10% in terms of headcount in 2023, compared to 46% growth in 2022. We're putting our teams to work across key important areas to build out our product ecosystem to address a sizable market opportunity ahead of us, $200 billion in gross profit opportunity, about 5% were penetrated in. But we're doing it in a way that enables them to be smarter with their work, more efficient and effective in their work.
Now, in terms of how you'll see that roll through our P&L, because we're run rating the hires that we made in 2022, we'd expect you to see more of the impact of that slower hiring and that pace of hiring in the back half of 2023 and into 2024. The second piece in terms of sales and marketing is around, again, orienting our spend towards areas that are more proven and that can impact our customer base and potential future customer segments that we can serve. So expect to slow our pace of sales and marketing spend to 5% to 10% in 2023 relative to where we were at about 25% last year. And I think this is an area for us to find continued improvement on in refining our sales and marketing motion across each of Square and Cash App.
From an overhead perspective, we're going to be looking across all of our corporate overhead expenses, from software and data utilization to real estate facilities to professional fees and a range of other discretionary areas. Now what that all means for 2023 is we expect to see 1 point or greater of margin expansion on an EBITDA basis, and we also expect to see margin expansion on an adjusted operating income basis.
But again, if we're going to sustain, not just reach, but sustain Rule of 40 over the long term, we need to continue investing in our business. And that's where we see opportunities around reaching new customer segments through our go-to-market motions, continuing to take share in our TAM and building new products that enable greater TAM expansion and unlocking new audiences through our emerging initiatives, and we'll continue to invest with discipline across each of those areas to ultimately build growth opportunities, profitable growth opportunities over the long-term. Great. Your next question is from the line of Timothy Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I want to focus a little bit on the restaurant vertical given the competition there. So you have the Square for Restaurant's vertical offering. At the May 2022 Investor Day, one of the big themes was the build-out of the vertical sales teams and the move upmarket to larger sellers. At the time, you talked about verticalizing the sales team, starting with the inbound teams and then building out further from there. Was hoping you could give an update on the progress there, the feet on the street effort, how many people we're talking about and how the LTV to CAC look for that type of a go-to-market effort relative to the historical Square approach? Hey, Tim, thanks for the question. So let's talk about our go-to-market approach for the Square business. We have targets that we look to maintain across both payback and returns. And that encompasses the full set of our costs across sales and marketing across US as well as international. And those blended rates, obviously being 3x ROI over four years and a six-quarter payback. And we've seen us over the past few years, the dynamic with that spend and our approach to the sales initiatives that you mentioned specifically throughout the year, and I think we'll continue to be dynamic here as we read our results in the environment in 2023.
Specifically to our sales efforts, we're in the early stages of building out a software led with-embedded-financial-services sales team. And this sales team not only has inbound capabilities but also outbound capabilities. We're building verticalization into our team. So where in the past, we had a more generalized sales team, we've started to now verticalize across our three key areas of restaurants, retail and services and expect this to benefit deal cycle times and win rates over time.
From an outbound perspective, we're also enhancing our capabilities here around targeting specific verticals and seller sizes using better data and signals that enable our team to be able to reach those sellers at the right time with the right message. And we expect outbound sales to be a bigger contributor to sell our acquisition over time.
Now this is a multi-year journey that we're on, on reorienting and building up the sales team, and we'll continue to iterate on our processes and tooling, but we are encouraged by the traction that we've had in building our upmarket success through mid-market sales. And what we're seeing is that our mid-market sellers have grown twice as fast in the fourth quarter than the total Square gross profit, excluding BNPL. Mid-market gross profit was up 16% year-over-year, excluding BNPL. So these go-to-market initiatives are starting to resonate, and we'll be making more progress over time as we continue to reorient the sales team and pair that with our marketing messages. Thank you, Amrita. Your next question comes from Cash App customer, Austin Watson [ph]. Your line is open. Hi. Yes, my name is Austin. I use Cash App as my primary bank account. I get my paycheck direct deposited. I use my Cash App Card every day. And I love the app, but I still have a legacy bank account for no other reason than auto bill pay. And for me, personally, this problem could be solved if I had the ability to schedule recurring payments just to other Cash App customers. But yes, so I guess the question is, are there any plans to enable scheduling recurring payments within the Cash App? Austin, first of all, thank you for using Cash App and seeing us as your primary banking tool. That's exactly what -- it's exactly the relationship we want to have with all of our customers. We're seeing more and more of that.
We're always going to be looking at things that people are trying to do with Cash App that we didn't build. Like we're -- we have a mindset of looking at the broadest patterns. And I'm sure we've seen desire for recurring payments to friends and to other Cash App customers across the board. And as we see more and more of that, we tend to prioritize it.
But right now, we're really focused on making sure like just the basics are rock solid for every type of customer that we have, whether you're just starting with a bank account or a savings account or you've had one. And really, that's a question of looking at like the limits we placed onto Cash App and what we enable to make it super easy for people.
So we've been focused on savings accounts. We've been focused on unlimited free withdrawals at ATMs and paper money deposits. So we don't have any immediate plans for recurring, but I'm sure it will be on the road map at some point in the future. But thank you so much. Your next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Look, it's great to hear your confidence around the $1.3 billion of EBITDA in pretty much any macro scenario. But if you could just give us a little bit more color on your assumptions for the base case macro backdrop embedded. And then just on that note, I'd love to know a little more specifically gross profit growth embedded in that base case. I guess relative to the 20% to 25% rates we're seeing through January into February, if you could just frame it in that way.
And then, Jack, just a bigger picture question on the sustainability of Cash App. Obviously, Cash Card was called out quite a bit, and we're seeing a lot of success there. But can you just revisit some of the drivers of sustainability medium-term with cash card now 25%, 30% of the mix? I think we'd just love to hear more on that. Thanks again guys. Hi Darrin, thanks for the questions. I'll start off on our 2023 EBITDA guidance and what our assumptions are with respect to growth in that guide. So first, what I'll share is our 2023 outlook is based on what we've seen so far. Obviously, exiting 2022 and our Q4 growth rates, but also the early part of this year, which we've shared with you.
From a growth perspective, we expect Cash App to grow faster than Square, which is a continuation of Q1 where you've seen consumer trends relatively stable for Cash App versus some moderation in a few discretionary verticals that we believe are macro related for Square.
Within Cash App, we expect to see -- when we think about our inflows framework of active inflows per active, which is the amount of money our customers bring in to Cash App and then monetization rate, we expect to see continued year-over-year growth across each of those three drivers of the Cash App business during 2023. We do expect to see some gross profit growth to slow in March for Cash App and Q2 onwards as we lap some of the pricing changes that we made last year.
From a Square driver's perspective, our focus, as you've heard so far today, continues to be refining our sales and marketing motion and continuing to grow and take advantage of the success that we've seen in growing upmarket with larger sellers, building out our omni-channel needs. We've seen now software plus integrated payments has become the significant portion of the Square business, 75% of Square's gross profit, ex PPP. And so continuing to focus on our strategic areas around upmarket, omni-channel, international and refining our sales and marketing motion for the Square business.
From a profitability perspective in 2023 by ecosystem, we are focused on efficiency here. And as you've heard, we're slowing the pace of growth meaningfully, and we also have the ability and a number of levers at our disposal to be nimble based on what we see from a macro perspective with those levers.
Now that said, by ecosystem, we expect Cash App margins to expand, which is a continuation really of some years now of improving profitability for the Cash App business. We expect Square margins to be more consistent year-over-year, partly due to some of the moderation of growth related to macro impact starting in mid-Q4. And given it's already high incremental margins, we outlined those in some great detail during our Investor Day last year.
But as you noted, in the midst of potential macro dynamism, we intend to hold to these profit targets. And if we see growth slow, as I noted, we have a number of levers that we're scrutinizing and have the ability to pull back prudently while still investing for planned expenses.
Just to clarify the second part of your question, Darrin? …but it's now, as you guys pointed out, almost 30% of the mix of revenues. And so what do you think about that business longer term in terms of the driving force of it to keep growing well? What's going to drive that? Thanks again guys. I'm sorry, you broke up a little bit, Darrin. Are you on mute? Are you talking about Cash App Card or other parts of the banking experience? I was just trying to figure out gross profit growth sustainability for Cash App in general. How -- what kind of drivers do you see given how strong Cash App Card has already contributed? Does it have a lot more to go? Is it other drivers? Yes. I mean, I -- just to start off, Amrita can opine in here as well. But I think the most important thing for us to grow the Cash App ecosystem is to continue to find adjacencies, adjacent financial services that complement one another. And there's certainly aspects to everything that we're doing around inflows, direct deposit, all these utilities and functionalities that we're building. One of them gets people into the ecosystem and drives them in. And then our goal is to really cross-sell and make sure that like we're -- people are able to find the other services quite easily, and there might be one that resonates even more, like Cash App Card.
So, I do believe that Cash App Card has a ton of room ahead of it. And I do believe that it's a great marketing device for us, in the same way that the original Square Reader was. When people see it, whether they see their friends use it or they see pictures over social media of how they designed it, it tends to effectively encourage people to download the app and make their own.
In the same way that the Square Reader seen at farmer's markets saw other sellers, who quickly was able to recognize what the power of that thing was and then decided to download for themselves. But it's just one part of the equation. And success to us means that it's not just Cash App Card that drives the ecosystem growth, but there's multiple entry vectors that all complement each other and encourage one other contribute to. Darrin, I'll just add that, Cash App now has FIVE revenue streams at $100 million or more in annualized gross profit. Instant Deposit, obviously, Cash App Card, as you've heard, at $750 million in 2022. Our Bitcoin revenue stream, business accounts and Cash App Borrow with several others that are smaller, but scaling. Like Cash App Pay, as an example, and other banking and commerce products. And even within Cash App Card, we're at about a 36% attach of Cash App Card monthly transacting actives QR overall monthly transacting actives in December. That's about 18 million actives on Cash App Card on a monthly basis. And we're seeing that Cash App Card is increasingly top of wallet to our customers with a broad use case in terms of everyday payments.
But to Jack's point about adjacencies, maybe one recent product launch to call out that's an example of that is our recent launch of peer-to-peer gift cards, where we allow customers to send a gift card from a wide range of merchants to their friends and family, who can then receive it and spend it through their Cash App Card. It's an example of a product that, for us, spans multiple development pillars. There's a community aspect, there's a peer-to-peer elements, and there's a banking aspect that ties in utility of Cash App Card, all while ultimately promoting more commerce within our ecosystem, which is a longer-term focus for us, particularly with Afterpay and our efforts there.
So, that's an example of an adjacency. There are numerous others like our savings accounts, which we just launched in January and is on of our fastest-growing products, which is yet another reason for people to bring money into Cash App, and you link a debit card and use roundups and a number of other features that end up creating an everyday experience for our customers through Cash App and through our banking offerings. That’s really helpful guys. Thank you very much. Your next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with SVB MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And thanks for all of the detail on Block's investment framework. This shift from the focus on adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating income is an important one and I think one that will be welcomed by a lot of investors. Can you just elaborate a bit more on the why now behind that shift and how it's being operationalized by the BUs? So for example, should we expect that we would see these non-cash items, SBC and D&A, et cetera, sort of decline or slow in their growth over time with the differential there narrows? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll start off here and Amrita can follow-up. But just from a high level, why now? As we talked in our Investor Day, but also a bit in the last quarter, we realized like our business is fairly unique. We're not -- we started with this one ecosystem called Square. And we've added other ones such as Cash App, Title and TBD. Two of them are at massive scale. And the other two are just beginning. And we intend to create new ecosystems, whether that comes from an organic creation like TBD or an acquisition like Title.
All these things are also under this purpose of economic empowerment. Like how do we serve entirely new audiences to empower them, give them simple tools to participate more fully in the economy? This is a complex business. It's not like many others that you probably cover. And the reason we wanted to share this is we wanted a simple way that we could communicate how we think about investing in ourselves and a simple way to help align the interest of our shareholders and you all with those of our customers.
So what was important to us was making sure that we had, first and foremost, a customer-focused metric, and that is gross profit retention, making sure that we are keeping the customers that we bring into the network. And most importantly, we're seeing them buy more and more services within the ecosystem that they started with, such as Square, or going to a completely different ecosystem such as Cash App, and utilizing more and more of our tools and staying with us.
And the second, we want account for real cost of the business. We've heard from a lot of you, we've heard from a lot of the broader investment community that SBC, the way it's accounted for, it just doesn't make sense. And we listened, we wanted to really see it as true cost and reported as such and hold a bar to ourselves on making sure that we integrate that as a real cost. So it's much clear and more transparent to you.
And then finally, we wanted to use phrases and words and formulas and concepts that you all are familiar with, which is where gross profit retention or an NRR and Rule of 40 really comes from, but do it in a way that raises the bar even more so. We believe that it's really important to recognize that this is a steady state goal for us. We're not there today, but it will help us really think about our investments, whether they be at scale ecosystems like Square and Cash App or newer ecosystems like Title and TBD to make sure that we're investing in the right way. So we're customer focused, that we're balancing the investment between all these ecosystems in the correct way. And ultimately, that we're fulfilling our promise of a model of ecosystem of ecosystem, which means that each one of them positively contributes to the other, and that we continue to disrupt ourselves with each one of these ecosystems.
Like I expect some of our ecosystems like TBD to be disruptive to what we're currently doing within Cash App. And I'm happy that we're thinking about that before external competitors. And that's exactly the model that we want to continue because ultimately, all this represents resilience. And so we're just going to use this investment model and make sure that we iterate as quickly as possible to hit it and to keep hitting it. Amrita, do you want to say anything more? Yes, Lisa, thanks for the question. We agree with you that it is a meaningful shift to include stock-based compensation and D&A, but particularly stock-based compensation and our profitability metrics. And what we wanted to do here was align our external disclosures and targets with how we're actually running the business internally.
So to now include SBC as a part of how our leaders are measured and our business units and business models are measured internally is we think the right level playing field across our businesses and across whether it's maturity type or business model. SBC is an important part of our compensation model here. We want our employees to be shareholders. And ultimately, that structure enables us to attract and retain amazing talent and invest in high-performing teams.
So this shift to adjusted operating income to account for SBC and D&A brings increased rigor to how we manage those costs, those SBC costs. And we want our teams to consider SBC as an expense when they are hiring and making those investment decisions. Over the long-term, we expect to drive efficiencies and leverage from SBC.
And historically, our share count dilution, just to get into some of the tactics around what we expect to see. Historically, our share count dilution from SBC has been in the low single-digit percent range, excluding impacts from converts, and we expect this trend to continue of low single-digit dilution for normal run rate across our business. Terrific. Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Josh Beck with KBCM. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question, and also thanks for collapsing your investment philosophy into one sentence. That's not easy to do for anyone. But I wanted to ask a little bit about Cash App. Amrita, I believe that you said pretty much all of three core drivers would be up in 2023. The one that I wanted to ask about was the inflows per MAU. You certainly did cite some, at least in the Square business, slowdown in discretionary spend. But I assume there are offsets things like obviously, Cash App Card attach, which I'm assuming is going to lead to higher direct deposit, which obviously had a really nice step up on the metrics you gave at 3Q.
So I'm curious to hear a little bit just about the drivers there as well as the monetization rate. Certainly, you mentioned the pricing changes and that's had a sizable impact. But as we look forward, should we be thinking about Borrow as a bigger driver or other items around the monetization side? Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question, Josh. So let's break down our inflows framework for Cash App. And we'll talk in a little bit more detail on one of the three measures, inflows per active, to your question.
So starting first with actives, 51 million monthly transacting actives in December. That grew 16% year-over-year, with importantly weekly and daily actives growing even faster. Over time, we've increasingly leveraged marketing to enhance the inherent virality in our peer-to-peer network effects, and that's enabled us to drive greater acquisition and product adoption for those new customers.
I think what's even maybe more important than the 51 million is that two out of three of those 51 million transacting actives are using Cash App on a weekly basis on average. And I think that's an indication of the growth of our product ecosystem and the product adoption within it that it's becoming a more and more everyday use case.
In terms of inflows per active, we were at $1,048 in the fourth quarter. That's relatively stable on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis despite lapping a period of government disbursements in the prior period and despite the broader uncertain macro environment. Ultimately, we're encouraged here by the healthy trends that we're seeing in inflows per active. And as we think about how to grow inflows per active over time, I think there's two key opportunities for us. And the third mix shift dynamic that's worth pointing out.
So, first, product adoption. We can drive more inflows through both cross-selling our existing products and the launch of new products. As we see our customers take on more products within Cash App that generally leads to greater inflows per actives. We've noted in the past that Cash App Card actives inflow twice the amount of money of peer-to-peer actives. And you see that increase as you move up the funnel into Direct Deposit and other deeper financial services. We're also increasing the number of inflows channels for the ways in which people can bring money into Cash App, for example, through paper money deposits, and that will continue to be a focus for us to make it easier to bring your money into Cash App and ultimately move it around.
We're also investing more in trust. This is really important for us as well. The team has been prioritizing both increased access, as I noted, as well as the ability to increase limits for customers who are looking to bring more money into Cash App each week. And we ultimately think that will enable us to drive greater share of wallet and expand into broader customer segments.
The third thing to note around inflows per active is that we may see a mix shift dynamic moving forward. Given that we're targeting a younger dynamic with Gen Z and have had success in this target with younger customers, there will be some pressure on inflows per active as these customers are more likely to have lower inflows per active earlier on in their financial journey. But these are also the customers who we expect to be the future spenders over the years to come and ones that we want to be a part of in their early financial journey and have the ability to grow with them over time.
Obviously, the third component of our inflows framework is monetization rate. And monetization rate is a factor of both the ability -- the pricing that we can charge our customers, and the mix -- their mix of usage across our products. We have a number of products that are free. We have some products that we charge for. And as we think about monetization rate, we think of it holistically across the entirety of the ecosystem.
Maybe just the last point I'd make since you asked about Cash Card. We see broad-based utility for Cash App Card. And as I noted earlier, spend per active actually has continued to grow on Cash App Card. And that broad-based utility means that we've been able to -- we see customers using across both discretionary and nondiscretionary use cases, whether it's gas and utilities or it's grocery, that's about one-third of the spend on Cash App Card over this past year. And that enables us to participate wherever our customers are spending in these dynamic times. Super helpful. Thank you, Amrita. Your next question is from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hey good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just have one housekeeping item and then one follow-up. First, it was helpful to get all the January and February gross profit pacing for Cash App and Seller on a reported basis. I was just wondering, if you'd be able to discuss those pacing figures, excluding Buy Now, Pay Later? And then second, could you just give us an update on the integration of the ecosystems, not only Afterpay across Cash App and Seller, but also things like Cash App Pay on Square Seller. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. I'll kick off on our Q1 top line trends so far. So what we've seen so far this year, I think there are two sets of numbers to orient you to. There is on an as-reported basis, which is 33% year-over-year growth estimated for Jan and February. And as we move into March, what we expect to see for the full first quarter is growth, that's a few points below this, of course, as we lapped the acquisition of Afterpay from Q1 of last year.
I think the second way to look at overall company gross profit growth so far this year is on a combined company basis, which would then include the $51 million contribution from a gross profit perspective for Afterpay in January of 2022. And when you look at that combined company growth, what we see is overall Block gross profit growth of approximately 25% year-over-year in January and February, which we expect to be relatively consistent for the full quarter as well and which is an improvement from what we saw in Q4 of 21% year-over-year growth on a combined company basis.
Within each of those, Cash App, we expect to grow at more than 50% on an as-reported basis in January and February, albeit March, we expect to see a slower growth rate as we lap the pricing changes. Really the drivers of Cash App growth are continued strength in active, inflows per active and monetization rate.
From a Square perspective, we expect to see gross profit growth of 15% on an as-reported basis in January and February. I think it's important to unpack the numbers further on Square here to see what's going on in the core Square ecosystem, ex BNPL and ex PPP. So just as a reminder, in Q3, Square, ex PPP and ex BNPL, grew 19% year-over-year. We saw some softening in discretionary verticals in Q4. And so that same rate of growth for the same Square, ex PPP and ex BNPL, was 17% in Q4. And now we're seeing growth for Square, ex PPP, ex BNPL, in January and February of 21%. So those are some of the puts and takes that we see across the Square ecosystem so far this year. And then in terms of the ecosystem integrations, the number one, we're focused on, obviously, is after paying this is the connection between Square and Cash App. We're still early in the product integration, but the place to look is obviously going to be in Cash App in the Discover Tab in marketplace. We believe that we started -- we're pretty early in just what this area will do. Right now, it looks like a fairly simple search. And I think the UI is a little bit off. But we're going to continue to iterate as quickly as possible to make sure that we meet the opportunity, which is pretty massive for us. We do -- we see a lot of opportunity not just there, but what you mentioned with Cash App Pay. We're starting more with some Afterpay merchants. So customers can browse and finance and discount offers at merchants who accept Cash App Pay.
And then we'll continue to move more and more towards the Square ecosystem. But I would say that integration, the acquisition and putting the companies together, we're in a much better position. Now we're really focused on the product and how these two things to come together. And I think there's a lot more integrations to come between other ecosystems, namely TBD and a bunch of what we're trying to do with Cash App globally. And then also tied to as well for artist and musicians in making sure that they have what they need to continue to build up their careers in the same way that we've served sellers as well. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude the program.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from our customers in addition to questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook and guidance, as well as our long-term targets and goals, and we may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.
Also, note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary estimates of gross profit growth, GPV, and GMV performance for the month of July. These represent our current estimates for July performance as we have not yet finalized our financial statements for the month of July and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual July results may differ from these estimates and may not be reflective of performance for the full third quarter.
Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by and is the responsibility of management. This preliminary financial information has not been reviewed or audited by our independent public accounting firm. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for July or the third quarter. Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40. With Rule of 40, we are evaluating the sum of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margins.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter, historical financial information spreadsheet, and Investor Day materials on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you for joining us today. I'll spend my time today highlighting the progress we've made on two themes; first, our investment framework, and second, our ecosystem of ecosystems model. You'll find everything else from the quarter in the shareholder letter we posted an hour ago.
As we shared earlier this year, we define our investment framework as Block and each ecosystem must show a believable path to gross profit retention of over 100% and Rule of 40 on adjusted operating income. Today, I wanted to share our progress towards this target and demonstrate how our investment framework forces us to make trade-offs and guides our decision-making across the company.
Leaders across our company are now looking at the true full-cost of their businesses, inclusive of share-based compensation. This has led us to pull back on our pace of hiring to be more targeted in hiring for critical roles and to focus more on performance management.
For sales and marketing, we are focused on efficiency to drive acquisition while decreasing spend. We've pulled back on-brand spends and more experimental channels across our ecosystems in favor of channels with more proven returns. This past quarter, we also decided to wind down operations in certain markets, including Cash App's diverse brands in the EU and our Buy Now, Pay Later platform, Clearpay in Spain, France, and Italy. These required significant investment and the markets have not seen the growth and profitability we had expected over the past several years. We see an opportunity to shift these resources towards strategic areas that have a higher potential return on investment. And we continue to drive towards our goal, we may identify other areas where we aren't seeing the expected and necessary returns.
We also continue to improve our cost structure for each of the ecosystems by identifying opportunities to expand our structural margins. These include the investments we make in technologies like automation and machine learning to manage risk, and finding ways to optimize our partnerships. As a result of our investment discipline, we are increasing our profitability expectations for this year, which Amrita will speak about. We'll continue to share updates with you as we make progress towards our target.
As a company, our strength and resilience comes from our diversified ecosystems, each serving different audiences and the connections we create between them. There are some notable examples of this work in the second quarter. In June, we turned on Cash App Pay as a payment method for Square invoices, giving customers the ability to pay outstanding invoices directly from their Cash App balance. In the second quarter, we launched Cash App Pay with several well-known Afterpay sellers, expanding the connection between Cash App and our Buy Now, Pay Later platform, and also recently launched strategic partnerships with payment providers Stripe, Adyen, and PayNearMe, an important step-in reaching a wider range of merchants.
We started enabling Square Payroll employees to file taxes for free by using automated [W2] (ph) import directly in the Cash App Taxes. After receiving a notification from Square Payroll, employees simply log into Cash App Taxes, securely import their W2, and complete and submit their tax forms. Earlier this year, we shared plans for the public beta testing of our Bitcoin Wallet, Bitkey. And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer Bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.
I'll now pass it to Amrita who will provide more details on our financials. Thanks, Jack. There are three topics I'd like to cover. First, an overview of our strong second quarter results across growth and profitability. Second, trends we're seeing across our business in July. And third, a look at our investment discipline and profit expectations for the remainder of the year.
In the second quarter, we had strong growth at scale with gross profit of $1.87 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Our strong profitability this quarter is a demonstration of our ability to drive leverage and operating efficiency in our business. Adjusted EBITDA was $384 million, more than two times year-over-year. Adjusted operating income, which, as a reminder, includes expenses related to stock-based compensation and depreciation was $25 million compared to a loss of $103 million a year ago.
Let's get into Square and Cash App. Square generated $888 million in gross profit, up 18% year-over-year. Looking at some of the drivers, gross profit from our vertical point-of-sale products was up 37% year-over-year, with each of our restaurants, retail, and appointments products delivering gross profit of more than $100 million on an annualized basis during the quarter.
Square GPV was up 12% year-over-year, looking at the components of growth across retention, churn, and acquisition. GPV per existing seller, which effectively measures same-store growth has stepped down since the third quarter of 2022 and has been the primary driver of the moderation in GPV growth since then. We achieved positive growth in acquisition and saw relative stability in churn of existing sellers compared to historical levels.
We're seeing strength in our Square banking products, which totaled $167 million in gross profit during the quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Banking products represented 19% of Square gross profit excluding PPP, up from 17% in the prior year. The four biggest drivers of Square banking during the quarter were Instant Transfer, Square Debit Card, Square Savings, and Square Loans. We saw benefits from raising pricing on Instant Transfer earlier this year from recent launches of our banking products outside the U.S. and from interest on Square Savings balances.
Lastly, for Square, growing up-market has remained strong with gross profit from mid-market sellers up 20% year-over-year. We believe the total addressable market for the larger sellers segment remains large and highly fragmented and our recent shift in go-to-market efforts is intended to drive further growth upmarket.
Cash App generated $968 million in gross profit, an increase of 37% year-over-year. Each component of our inflows framework, Actives, Inflows per Transacting Active, and Monetization Rate grew on a year-over-year basis. During the month of June, we reached 54 million monthly transacting actives, up 15% year-over-year. We've continued to see significantly higher attention for actives with larger network sizes. During the quarter, those with a network of four or more represented more than half of Cash App quarterly transacting actives.
Peer-to-peer functionality has allowed us to scale our network rapidly and has driven engagement. In the second quarter, peer-to-peer transactions per actives reached an all-time quarterly high, which helped drive $53 billion in peer-to-peer volume across Cash App during the second quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year.
Inflows per Transacting Active averaged $1,134 in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and relatively stable compared to the first quarter, which typically has a seasonal benefit from tax refunds. We believe there is significant runway for growth in Inflows per Transacting Active over time through increased product adoption and growing share of wallet. This tax season more than one-third of Cash App Taxes Actives chose to receive their refund directly into Cash App, a meaningful increase year-over-year, driving new actives to direct deposit.
Product adoption has been especially strong for our financial services products, both Cash App Card and direct deposit experienced strong growth in actives and volumes. Monetization rate, which excludes gross profit contributions from our BNPL platform was 1.44%. Monetization was up 16 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by pricing changes over the past year, and up 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the timing of strong first quarter inflows during the tax season.
Lastly, our BNPL platform contributed $84 million of gross profit to each of Square and Cash App in the second quarter. GMV from our BNPL platform was $6.4 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Losses on consumer receivables were 1.01% of GMV, relatively consistent with the prior year.
Next, an update on July trends. For the month of July, we expect total gross profit growth of 21% year-over-year, which we would orient you to for the third quarter and the remainder of 2023. Looking at each ecosystem, for the month of July, we expect Square gross profit to grow 15% year-over-year, which we expect to be relatively consistent through the third quarter. The moderation in gross profit growth from the second quarter is primarily due to transaction margin compression as we lapse certain benefits from more favorable interchange economics last year.
Square GPV is expected to be up 12% year-over-year, consistent with the second quarter as we've seen stability in GPV growth over the past three months from May through July. For the fourth quarter, we expect gross profit and GPV growth to improve slightly compared to the third quarter as Square benefits from more favorable comparisons.
For Cash App, we expect gross profit to grow 27% year-over-year in July, and similar to Square, we expect it to be relatively consistent through the third quarter. In 2023, we continue to expect growth on a year-over-year basis from monthly Transacting Actives, Inflows per actives, and Monetization Rate. We expect Cash App's monetization rate in the back half of the year to be more consistent with the second quarter and we expect gross profit to grow more in line with the overall inflows as a result. Given the focus on efficiency, the wind down of Verse will have an impact on monthly actives going forward, although we do not expect an impact to inflows or gross profit.
Four the fourth quarter we expect a slight moderation in Cash App's gross profit growth, driven by stabilization in Cash App's monetization rate, and as we lapse stronger growth in the prior year period. For our BNPL platform, we expect year-over-year GMV growth in July to be similar to the second quarter's 22%, with GMV growing faster than gross profit due to regional mix.
Turning to our progress against Rule of 40 and our profit expectations for the remainder of the year. Our investment framework sets up an ambitious goal, and we're focused on progressing towards it over the long-term. We'll continue to share updates with you and hold ourselves accountable. Expanding on what Jack touched on, we've worked to deliver efficiencies through the first half of the year. On hiring, we drove leverage compared to our expectations entering the year by encouraging efficiencies among existing teams and prioritizing hiring in more critical areas. We expect our headcount growth in 2023 to be below the 10% target set out earlier this year.
With sales and marketing, we've pulled back on lower ROI channels to increase our efficiency, while Cash App's variable sales and marketing expenses namely peer-to-peer and Cash App Card issuance costs were up year-over-year, overall company customer acquisition spend was down year-over-year, driving leverage across Square and Cash App. Despite this pull back, we saw healthy acquisition across each ecosystem as we shifted our mix of spend. And looking at corporate overhead spend, we began to identify cost savings opportunities by downsizing our real estate footprint across some of our West Coast office locations.
Given some of these items on a GAAP basis, operating loss was $132 million in the second quarter, which includes the impact of acquisition-related amortization expenses, as well as restructuring expenses for the wind down of Verse and Clearpay in certain markets and write-downs for certain real estate facilities among other items. We expect to find further leverage opportunities in these and other overhead expenses over time.
Moving to our full-year 2023 profit guidance. As we have progressed further into the year, we have better line-of-sight into our planned expenses and our updated guidance today reflects this. We're increasing our expectations for profitability in 2023 and now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion and adjusted operating income of $25 million for the full-year 2023. We expect to achieve profitability on an adjusted operating income basis for the year, which is inclusive of share-based compensation expenses. We continue to expect year-over-year margin expansion on both an adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income basis.
Our updated full-year guidance represents a step-up of $140 million for each figure compared to our prior guidance. This represents both the gross profit momentum in our business during the second quarter and the focus on expense discipline we delivered in the first half of the year, which we expect to continue to drive in the second half of the year.
Finally, touching on the third quarter, we expect third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.55 billion and we expect share-based compensation to increase by approximately $25 million relative to the second quarter. As Jack mentioned, share-based compensation remains an area on which we are focused and expect to drive greater leverage over time. We're excited about the progress we've made towards our investment framework and Rule of 40 this quarter and are eager to continue to work.
With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tien-Tsin Huang at JP Morgan. Hey, thanks so much here. So, given your July month update tracking a little bit slower than the second quarter and also your profit update which you raised. Just love to hear your updated thoughts on operating leverage. I know I asked that quite a bit, but just operating leverage here in the second half versus the first half. Is operating leverage going to be driven more by the top-line or by expense focus that you also talked about across the two ecosystems? Thanks. Hey, thanks for the questions, Tien-Tsin. So obviously, as we see strong second quarter results across both top-line and profitability, we're pleased with our ability to show discipline in our operating expenses, finding efficiencies while continuing to strongly grow the business. And we expect to deliver continued discipline on our expenses in the back half of this year and that's what led to raising our profitability targets for the full-year by $140 million, reflective of -- on each of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income, which reflects not only the strong performance in the second quarter, but raises our guidance for the remainder of the year.
And as you heard our second quarter -- our July expected gross profit growth of 21% year-over-year growth, we would urge you to look at from a third -- full third quarter perspective, and remainder of 2023 perspective as well to see some stability from a gross profit perspective at the Block level from July forward. As we noted, there is some lapping effects within Cash App and Square related to pricing dynamics within Cash App and related to interchange economics within Square.
From an operating leverage perspective, we see a number of opportunities for us, not only that we've executed on in the first half of this year and expect to continue to drive into the second half, but also as we look forward longer-term. Namely three that I'd call out to you is the three biggest areas in our expense base of leverage: first, sales and marketing; second, around hiring and headcount; and third, around our corporate overhead.
From a sales and marketing perspective, we're focused on finding efficiencies and optimizing our spend. What you saw in the second quarter was our overall customer acquisition spend was down year-over-year with leverage across Square and Cash App. And despite this, we continue to see healthy acquisition across Square and Cash App as we oriented more of our remaining spend towards more proven channels and more proven areas of return.
Secondly, with hiring, we've taken a more disciplined approach to growing our teams. In the first half of the year, we drove leverage compared to our expectations, and are encouraging more efficiencies out of our existing teams. Over time we'd expect to see a slower pace of hiring, which drive leverage here as well as on stock-based compensation.
From an overhead perspective, as we noted in the quarter, in the second quarter, we downsized our real estate footprint on the West Coast for some relatively modest savings, but longer-term we expect to drive leverage across a number of meaningful areas of spend here, whether it's software and data usage or real estate facilities, professional fees, T&E and a range of other discretionary areas. Ultimately, our investment framework and our target of achieving Rule of 40, which is a growth plus margin framework, will help us make these important trade-offs as we continue to invest to drive long-term profitable growth in the back half of this year and into 2024 and beyond, while doing so prudently and with discipline in our operating expense base. Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it. We'll take our next question from [indiscernible] with Wolfe Research. Hey, guys, this is Darrin Peller on from Wolfe. You had 12% GPV growth into July, I think you just said, Amrita, right? And then, in comparison that was around 6% to 7% growth, so obviously, your share is still gaining and holding up versus the industry, if you could just touch on what's working well there? And then also maybe expand on the verticalization efforts in the segment? While we're on that topic though, I mean, the verticalization efforts obviously is going to come with some investments. So if you could just remind us your view on profitability levels beyond 2023 and I know the Rule of 20 there, but just without a time frame, it's hard to really handicap how to think about progress in 2024 and 2025? Hey, thanks for the question, Darrin. So, I think what I'll do is I'll first hit what we're seeing in terms of Square GPV in the second quarter and into July, and then we'll hit upon the verticalization efforts for the Square business.
So what we're seeing in terms of July trends was fairly consistent with what we've seen really through May. We've seen stability in GPV trends from May through July, with July coming in at that 12% year-over-year basis, consistent with the second quarter also at 12%. If you unpack that by vertical in the second quarter, food and drink TPV grew by 17% year-over-year. Retail GPV grew by 9% year-over-year. Services also by 9%. Services, of course, encompassing a number of sub-sectors, beauty, health and fitness, home and repair, professional services. We have seen some moderation trends across the discretionary and non- discretionary verticals which we have talked about since really that mid-Q4 timeframe, and that's really broad-based across a number of different verticals.
From a geographic perspective, what we've seen is, international markets had continued to also see some of those macro-related headwinds, which were more pronounced in Australia in the second quarter, albeit with overall growth ex-BNPL, continuing to be at a much faster rate of growth in the overall base of the business at 35% year-over-year growth for those international markets in the second quarter. And again, from a month-to-month perspective, generally seen greater stability from May through July on those GPV trends for Square.
Driving the -- diving into your verticalization question now, which I think is a key question for us as we think about continuing to grow up-market, where we have seen outsized growth. From a gross profit perspective, up-market grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter for us. This is a key area for us as we continue in our strategic focus on bringing larger sellers onto our platform and acquiring those sellers across our key verticals of restaurants, retail, and beauty. Within our sales team, our focus has been on providing our reps with the right tools, industry knowledge and signals to prospect, and to acquire sellers across those three verticals.
Let's take inbound and outbound sales, within inbound, we began verticalizing our US inbound sales team last year. We completed that in April of this year and since that completion, we've seen an improvement in gross profit added per account executive and in software attach rates, still early but encouraging trends there.
Now for outbound, we finalized verticalizing our US outbound sales team in July, so just this past month. Our account executives have now completed their industry training programs, which enables them to really deepen their knowledge within the assigned vertical that they've got. And we anticipate our account execs will continue to ramp through Q3 and hopefully be fully ramped into Q4. With those changes, our goal is to increase gross profit account added per account exec and software attach rates as we've seen with the inbound sales team, and as we see those signals and gain confidence there on our processes and results, we'll look to continue to scale the outbound sales team over time.
Ultimately, we will be iterating on this in the coming quarters and years as this is a long-term initiative for us to continue to go up-market and with our vertical points of sale and to drive those sustained results over time. We'd expect to see these results paying-off and driving growth into 2024. And expect our overall go-to-market spend to target that three times ROI over four years. Okay. Thanks, Amrita. And we'll take our next question from Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to talk about seller sales and marketing or Square sales and marketing a little bit. So this year's marketing expense, you mentioned, it's benefiting from some of the annualization of the pullback that you had on brand, awareness, and some of the experimental stuff, so a shift towards more efficient spent. But sometimes there is a concern from investors that, because the dollar amount is lower, that the size and health of the new cohorts coming in might actually be a little bit smaller, but we gather that the payback periods have really come in more than the four to five range, and they had expanded to maybe six to seven at one point last year. So with all that context, maybe you could talk about the health and the size of the cohort that you're bringing in now for Square. Sure, happy to take that. Thanks for the question, Tim. Let me start with the cohort trends on payback periods and then we can dive into what we're seeing in the first half of the year in terms of spend and customer acquisition. So, in 2022 -- for our 2022 cohort, we're seeing trends toward a six to seven-quarter payback, which is slightly higher than our expectations as these cohorts have cured. Square sales and marketing spend was up approximately 20% year-over-year in 2022 compared to 2021. From a 2023 cohort perspective, we're targeting approximately a five-quarter payback as we expect payback to improve compared to last year, and have a more meaningful impact to growth in 2024. And as I just mentioned, our longer-term target across the go-to-market investments for Square remains the 3 times ROI over four years.
When you look at the first half of this year, we have pulled back on sales and marketing spend. Through the first half of the year, Square sales and marketing is down 6% year-over-year, and we expect continued pullback for the rest of the year. Again, we're focused on optimizing our mix of investments across channels and driving efficiency, so we pulled back meaningfully on our brand and awareness channels on a year-over-year basis, as well as sales, and we've reduced the size of the team meaningfully as we focus on reorganizing the teams and enhancing our data and incentives as I was just speaking to on the sales team.
Despite those pullbacks, we've seen strong growth in acquisition over the past two quarters, with year-over-year growth in acquisition improving in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. This is with Square sales and marketing down slightly year-over-year in the second quarter and down 6% through the first half of the year. And we'll take our next question from... Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to drill in a little bit on the initiatives you have underway to connect Block’s to ecosystems. In the shareholder letter and prepared remarks, you called out a few different ones with Cash App Pay also I saw 15% growth in Cash for Business, and a couple of other highlights in there, can you just kind of take a step back and update us some of your current overall strategy for connecting ecosystems and maybe some data points on the benefits you see in the organization, the kind of network effects, as well as maybe some of the profitability that you see. Thank you. Yes, I can start with that. So as we've talked about, we do believe our power and especially resilience in our business as it is the fact we have multiple different ecosystems serving different audiences, and I've been spending a lot of my time and focus on looking for opportunities with the teams to connect them. Some of the ones we mentioned earlier on the remarks are mostly between Square and Cash App, so Payroll and Cash App Taxes was a big one. Cash App and Square through Afterpay is the biggest part of my focus right now and I'm really excited about the strategy. We continue to refine it and look for opportunities to build a really compelling experience within the Cash App that builds network effects and increases our network effects within Cash App, but also enables us to have an app that people are checking every day, because there's something interesting and especially as we balance that with Square and our network of sellers like it's even more unique and more compelling.
Cash App and our Bitcoin hardware, specifically the Bitcoin Wallet, we announced a partnership in a launch. There will be a global first product. We will be launching in the most countries we've ever launched in to start. And we're constantly looking for other ones, there's a lot around Cash App Pay and Square, especially around local offers and local merchants and we continue to find more and more connections and that doesn't speak to the future ones, which would be titled in looking at opportunities for Square, especially musicians looking forward to sell merchandise for ticketing, and TBD, we believe with its protocol will enable both Cash App and Square and even entitled to move much faster and move much faster globally. So we're excited about that.
So we have a mix of external products facing features that connect the two ecosystems and a lot of internal stuff as well. We're using more shared resources or shared learnings and able to move much faster as an individual ecosystem because the work is already done by a peer ecosystem. Thank you. We will take our next question from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It's good to see the strong growth coming out of Square's International markets yet again. I believe Square recently highlighted that many of its verticalized software products are now available in some of the company's largest international markets. Can you just talk about the opportunity here from a software penetration perspective compared to the US and how -- I guess, how have been these verticalized software products in these local markets can help you sustain the momentum behind the international business in terms of GPV growth and gross profit growth? Yes, thanks for the question. I'll start. So our priority with Square is to achieve parity across each of our markets, meaning, that we launch all our features in any one particular market globally. There is various challenges to doing that, Square Loans being an example, different regulatory environments, that just increases the workload. And every new market that we take on, it does have some cost to us doing more features for the general product, so we're always avoiding that costs and making sure that we're picking the right markets at the right time.
We made a lot of strides in Q2 with the launch of 30 products across our global markets for Square. One of the most notable was Tap to Pay on Android and that's available to sellers in the US, Australia, the UK, Ireland, France, and Spain. This is a big deal as TAP becomes the dominant way to pay, more and more people are using their phones, especially outside of the United States and Europe and Australia.
And then, we also launched our second-generation Square Reader in the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, France, Ireland, and Spain, and this improves the battery life, stronger connection, NFC performance, and it allows sellers around the world to take secure payments from just about anywhere, it's extremely affordable. Australia continues to be very strong in the 12 months ending in June, almost half of Square's gross profit in Australia came from sellers that used for monetized products, which is up from less than one-third two years ago. And we've seen our Square banking products contribute to some of the strong gross profit growth we've seen in international markets as well. So we continue to push. Going international has to be more deliberate and therefore a little bit slower. We've learned a lot as we go into every market and each market that we open, we can move much faster and ideally grow faster as well. And I'd just add, Ken, that as you noted, this is a big opportunity for us. We believe that in these markets outside the US that we're in, we're less than 1% penetrated in the opportunity with a long runway for growth. So, as I noted, our gross profit growth for Square excluding the BNPL platform in our markets outside the US was 35% year-over-year in the second quarter, now at about 11% of Square's total gross profit ex-BNPL with GPV up 26% year-over-year and 32% on a constant currency basis, and that really encompasses, as Jack was saying, the rollout of additional products across the full suite, whether it's payments, software, hardware, as well as banking products now more recently, where we're seeing strong traction and where we've got our work to continue to build upon this momentum. Great. Thank you, both. We take our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Bryan Keane
Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. We were excited to see the 1 million Cash App Pay Active use base, just curious on the timeline for merchant distribution and acquirer expansion for Cash App Pay. And then maybe you can just go over the revenue model for Cash App Pay in particular? Thank you. Yes. So with Cash App Pay, our goal is to provide a lot more flexibility for customers. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have expanded our distribution recently with partnerships with Stripe, Adyen, and PayNearMe, which allows us to reach a much broader range of merchants and also industries. We launched some additional Afterpay merchants in Q2, including Steve Madden and Fenty Beauty, and we still see significant room to grow the adoption of Cash App Pay, and we're actively pursuing a pipeline of new merchants, Afterpay certainly helps with that.
During the second quarter, nearly $500 million in annualized volume was processed through Cash App Pay, and nearly 1 million Cash App Pay monthly actives as of June. So it allows us to reach customers beyond those that the Cash App Card is serving. We've seen really strong adoption amongst our younger audience, gen-z demographic. So, we've seen promising results and we're still looking for opportunities to make sure that we continue to see those and push it. And I'll just add, Bryan, that we see merchants eager to onboard with Cash App Pay because of the access to the very attractive customer base that we have, 54 million monthly transacting actives as of June, who are highly engaged on our platform and inflows over $1,100 during the second quarter, and so with Cash App Pay being present as a payment device on their platform, they get access to these customers who don't even necessarily have to have been signed-up by a Cash App Card, and that's really the proposition that we're selling into these merchants -- these large merchants, who are finding real product fit here with Cash App Pay. Great. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Hi, good afternoon. Can you expand upon your comments around headcount growth in the business? It's been very strong over these past few years. How are you seeing potential for efficiencies, for example, in your engineering teams with AI? And Amrita, I know you talked about the headcount growth for this year, but how should we think about headcount growth trajectory over the medium-term? Thank you. Yes, I think the biggest change has been our investment framework and making all teams and leaders and managers aware of the true cost of the business and taking into account stock-based compensation, so we have slowed hiring and we have targeted more -- we've been more targeted in our hiring to get much stronger talent and looking deeply at performance management as well. Of course, there's always efficiencies to bring to the table, but we just want to make sure that we're looking at each ecosystem and really putting the decisions in the hands of the folks running those teams and really running the company with everyone having the investment model in their head to make sure that we are achieving the growth that we want to see at the cost that we want to minimize. So it is early as we just rolled out this investment framework, but it does seem to be working and this is something that's in the consciousness of the organization. Great. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the next steps in the Afterpay integration and could you discuss more broadly, what are the next thing to look out as you integrate Afterpay? Yes, as I said, this is where a lot of my focus is right now. I'm meeting the team members on a daily basis to make sure that we come up with a compelling and differentiated experience. A lot of the work is going to be found within Cash App and the Cash App Discover tab, it's a little magnifying glass in your interface. We want to build a compelling experience that people want to go back to daily to find offers, to find deals, to find items, to find merchants around them, and that would be a place that also continues to push on our ecosystem of ecosystem model so that we're benefiting -- the Square ecosystem and the Square ecosystem benefits Cash App.
So that will probably be where you'll see the highest velocity changes. A lot of it has to do with our ability to rank this items and merchants and deals and offers on a relevant basis, and obviously, we will be applying machine learning and deep learning to do that based on all the signals we get. But that's where the ecosystems really come together in our highest impact way, we believe, and it leads to many other opportunities down the line, so that's where I would look. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Hi, thanks for taking my questions this evening. I wanted to ask you to dive in a little bit deeper on the move up-market and seller, and just kind of comment on how the larger retailers and merchants are utilizing Block services maybe differently than the smaller merchants. How does the value proposition sort of change, what's resonating, and then just what strategy you might use to sort of lean into this move up-market? So, in terms of the verticalization and attracting -- getting people more up-market, I think the biggest one is, we just have a much more focused effort around these verticals and there we maintain flexibility. A lot of our competitors are working on one vertical. We're working on all three, all three of the dominant ones that you find within commerce. So the big aspects that people choose Square for is because, I might be a restaurant chain, but I also have some retail elements or it might be a chain of nail salons and provide services and retail. So we're seeing a lot of crossover between all these verticals and because Square is one ecosystem and they all -- it all connects together with all the operational utilities as well. It's very easy to choose and it's very easy to add these new dimensions to your offering to your customers, which ultimately differentiates you from your competitors and encourage ourselves.
So, if I were to point to one thing, that would be the flexibility that we enable and that flexibility extends to as you do get bigger or you're coming to us as a bigger entity or you might have legacy systems or you might need to do custom work and that's where our Square platform comes in, enables people to hire developers themselves, take tools, offer marketplace, to actually customize their work and customize their own system so that they can build the experience that they want for their customers so that flexibility is really significant, and one that continues to set us apart. It also allows us to move much faster because we're using the same developer platform internally as we're exposing externally. So a lot of our interfaces are built on that. And it allows us to focus on the interface and experience and make sure that all of our developers have access to the same tools that we do, so they can build really compelling additions and our larger merchants can build compelling additions themselves on the same tools and that same foundation. Thank you. And I'll just add, Ramsey, that if you think about, to your question how the larger sellers use our platform differently from smaller sellers, I think one simple way to answer that is, they use more of our platform than smaller sellers and I think the last stat we shared in 2022, the mid-market sellers who adopted for more of our products had 15 times greater attention than those who only adopted one, and you know, they generally adopt more products than smaller sellers. So that ability to do take on more jobs on behalf of that merger seller ultimately builds more retentive relationship with them.
And as Jack mentioned, that comes through not only in our vertical software offerings, each of which is now running at an annualized gross profit growth rate of $100 million or more during the second quarter but also a developer platform which provides third-party integrations, so the sellers can build more customized solutions and applications across a number of different aspects, not just payments, but orders, inventory, customers, et cetera. And so the growth that we're tracking on our vertical points of sale, 37% year-over-year in the second quarter and gross profit growth from our developer tools, which also outpaced overall Square gross profit growth, a real key area for us to continue to be tracking here along with our go-to-market orientation around a greater verticalized orientation from a marketing and sales perspective. We see this as being key elements of our platform and our go-to-market approach that ultimately helps us attract larger sellers. Great. Thanks so much. We'll take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the SNS line within seller the disclosure on Square banking was helpful to see this quarter, but if you could just give us kind of a snapshot of current stack rank of the biggest revenue contributors to that line today? And then, second part to that would be on Payroll. Jack, you mentioned in your remarks some of the integration there with Cash App Taxes, but any broader update on Payroll and how you're thinking about the longer-term opportunity to cross-sell into the existing sellers base there? Thanks. Sorry, your first question was on. Go ahead, Amrita. I think the first question was on subscription and services within Square and helping the stack rank some of the largest Square products within that line. And I would orient you, Trevor, to our Square banking disclosures, where Square banking contributed $167 million in gross profit in the second quarter, the four biggest sort of areas there being Square Loans, Instant Transfer, Square Debit Card, and now our Square Savings product as well, which we're now recognizing interest benefits from as part of our gross profit as well. So those are kind of the four biggest products from a banking perspective that I'd orient you to and that are driving meaningful growth in our Square banking initiative and more broadly across SNS for Square. I think the second question, Trevor, you had was on Payroll. It was on Payroll, yeah, exactly. Just a cross-sell opportunity into the existing merchant base. Thanks. I think we continue to see as we -- especially as we grow our sales initiatives and deepen those relationships with upmarket sellers, we see a significant opportunity to drive software attached, whether its Payroll or any of our other 30-plus products across the Square ecosystem to drive attach into upmarket sellers. And so that's a key part of our initiatives. And as I mentioned, it's early days, we're only a few months into having verticalized our inbound US sales team, but we are seeing higher software attach from that verticalization and we're now in the process of ramping our outbound sales team as well, and hope to continue to drive that through products like Payroll and other products as we build those touchpoints with up-market sellers. We'll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Hey, thanks, guys. Just can you quickly review what you said about Square gross profit and GPV growth for Q4? And then just on the Cash App side, I think the inflows per active were up 8% in Q2, do you expect that to stay pretty stable in the second half? Thanks. Jason, happy to take that one or start on that one. So let's start with Square and will unpack some of the GPV trends that we're looking at. Generally, we look at Square growth across three high-level components, customer acquisition, churn. and same-store growth. In the second quarter, we saw acquisition grow year-over-year, as I've mentioned already, churn was relatively stable and we saw a moderation or where we've seen moderation in growth is in the same-store growth element of those three elements or GPV per seller.
So, let me kind of walk-through and unpack each of those. From a customer acquisition standpoint, in both the first quarter and the second quarter, we saw year-over-year growth in acquisition and based on trends to date, acquisition growth in the second quarter improved compared to the first quarter. From a churn perspective, since the third quarter of 2022, we've seen relative stability in churn of existing sellers on a year-over-year basis, no material changes there. From a same-store growth perspective or a GPV per sellers, there is a kind of a couple of things that unpack for you where we've seen the moderation.
First, it looks to be consumer-related. Second, it looks to cross multiple verticals. Third, this -- sort of retention dynamic or GPV per seller dynamic. Teams that account for the majority of the GPV growth [indiscernible] that we've seen since the third quarter of last year. And for us, we see similarity in our data here on GPV per seller trend to broader third-party data as well. So let me kind of walk-through each of those elements.
First, processing volumes at existing sellers are again sort of that same-store growth element, were lower in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 levels. We noted seeing the similar dynamics since mid-November, which is kind of that Q4 timeframe that you're referencing. We believe it's consumer-related as growth spend per card and the number of unique cards remains lower than October levels, while churn, as I mentioned remains relatively stable. Ultimately, obviously, we manage the business to gross profit but unpacking some of the GPV trends might be helpful to illustrate here. Since the third quarter of 2022, we've seen an 8 point slowdown in Square's global GPV growth from 20% or so to 12% or so. We estimate the GPV per seller or same-store growth has been responsible for the vast majority of the slowdown since the third quarter of last year.
It's really impacting nearly all the verticals we see in recent quarters and impacts broadly across the seller base by seller size as well, but perhaps more pronounced amongst larger sellers. And similar to the data that we've seen and that we're tracking on third-party data, since the third-quarter, our US GPV growth has slowed by 7 points and we've seen an 8 point slowdown in growth of US retail sales and a 6 point slowdown in the growth of Visa and Mastercard volumes in the US. So these are some of the key elements that I'd point you to that kind of unpack what we're seeing from a same-store growth or GPV trend-line perspective. [indiscernible] for 2023, I just wanted to make sure I heard the commentary right there. Sorry, say that again, on 2023? For the fourth quarter of 2023, the relative growth rate you're expecting on GP and GPV versus Q3, 2023. Sure, yes, what we shared for Q4 was that we expect to see a slight improvement in gross profit and GPV growth compared to Q3. Q3, remember we're sort of -- urge you need to look at the July rate for Q3, the July rates being 15% gross profit growth for Square and 12% GPV growth for Square, but we expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter given some of the more favorable comparisons. Again as I referenced, we started to see some of the moderation in growth across these verticals in the mid-Q4 time-frame of last year. The second part of your question, Jason, was on inflows per active, the 8% growth there, and in the second quarter, and I think your question was just sort of the sustainability or how we see growth on inflows per active over time. Yes, for the second half of this year. Thanks. Sure. Yes, as I noted in the remarks earlier, we expect from 2023 perspective to see overall growth in inflows per active. We saw that 8% growth in the second quarter as well, and relative stability quarter-over-quarter even though we have a greater impact from tax refunds in the first quarter. Ultimately, we've been encouraged here by the healthy trends. As we look forward, I think there's kind of two dynamics that I'd point out beyond the broader question of consumer health and consumer spend levels. One is product adoption. If we can drive more product adoption and cross-sell of our products, that gives customers more reasons to onboard more funds into Cash App.
Also, if we give customers more ways that they can onboard their funds into Cash App that also, for example, Pay for money deposits in the past couple of quarters, that also gives us -- leads to incremental volumes on inflows and opportunities to engage customers through our products. The one mitigating element to that is the mix-shift dynamic as we attract younger demographics into Cash App and we've seen strong and encouraging trends with younger demographics like Gen-Z demographics that could put some pressure on inflows per active as these customers are more likely to have lower inflows per active earlier in their financial journey, but this is the demographic that we want to be growing with over the long-term. So those are kind of the two dynamics that I would share with you as you think about modeling inflows per active over time. Very helpful, thanks. And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna International Group. Hi. I was wondering, Amrita or Jack, how Afterpay is performing relative to your expectations from a credit perspective. I realize losses on consumer receivables were just 1.01%, essentially the same as last year, but is that more due to your treatment of the credit box? How, overall, are you thinking about that, the originations versus the profitability from a credit perspective? Thank you. I can start on that one. What I would say is that what we've seen for Afterpay in the first half of this year is stability to improvement and overall trend lines from a topline perspective, whether you look at GMV or gross profit with consistent loss rates and we've maintained a really disciplined approach here to risk loss and continue to see stable trends in consumer health and repayment behavior with stability as you noted on losses on consumer receivables from the year-over-year perspective in the second quarter. This is while GMV was up 22% year-over-year in the second quarter and improving from the 17% growth rate in the first quarter.
And similarly, while gross profit was up improving from -- at 13% year-over-year in the second quarter, improving from 10% in the first quarter. So we've seen stable to improving trends on the core BNPL products within Afterpay, while we continue to focus on much larger opportunities on integration with the commerce pillar connecting our Cash App and Square ecosystems and while we maintain healthy loss rates across the ecosystem. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.","we will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions . all statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking . this call includes discussions of our outlook and guidance, as well as our long-term targets and goals .",0.0

[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward looking. These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook and guidance as well as our long-term targets and goals and we may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note that forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will provide preliminary estimate of performance for the month of October. This represents our current estimate for October performance as we have not yet finalized our financial statements for the month of October, and our monthly results are not subject to interim review by our auditors. As a result, actual October results may differ from this estimate and may not be reflective of performance for the full fourth quarter.
Moreover, this financial information has been prepared solely on the basis of currently available information by and is the responsibility of management. This preliminary financial information has not been reviewed or audited by our independent public accounting firm. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for October or the fourth quarter. Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40. With Rule 40, we are evaluating some of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margins. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter historical financial information spreadsheet and investigator materials on our Investor Relations website.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on the website shortly. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. I'm sorry, that was on me. So we're going to do something a little bit different this year. Thank you all for joining us. We wrote -- I wrote a shareholder letter to you all, which you'll find on our website. And we're going to focus our call to maximize questions. So we're going to start with Amrita, providing more detail into what I wrote, most notably reaching our Rule of 40 goal in 2026  authorizing a repurchase of $1 billion in shares to offset a portion of dilution from share-based compensation. If you haven't yet, please read that letter for all the details and what I'm focused on going forward. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are 4 topics I'd like to cover. First, our strong performance in the third quarter and increased profitability expectations for the remainder of the year. Second, a preliminary view of 2024 and where we're demonstrating discipline on our investments to drive margin improvement. Third, our path to achieving Rule of 40 in 2026 and lastly, our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders.
In the third quarter, gross profit was $1.90 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We delivered our highest ever quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $477 million or 25% margin on gross profit. Adjusted operating income which, as a reminder, includes expenses related to stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $90 million and 5% margin on gross profit compared to $32 million a year ago. Our strong profitability during the quarter demonstrates our focus on efficiency in pursuit of our investment framework. Cash flow generation has also been strong and improving. Adjusted free cash flow was $427 million in the quarter compared to $88 million in the prior period.
For the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was $945 million up from negative $99 million in the prior period. Let's get into Square and Cash App. Square generated $899 million in gross profit, up 15% year-over-year. Square GPV grew 11% year-over-year or 12% on a constant currency basis. We're committed to serving sellers locally and through our banking products. In the third quarter, we experienced strong growth from our vertical point-of-sale products with gross profit up 29% year-over-year, and our banking products up 20% year-over-year. Cash App generated $984 million in gross profit, an increase of 27% year-over-year.
Looking at the components of the inflow framework. As of September, there were 55 million monthly transacting actives up 11% year-over-year, with growth driven by our peer-to-peer network. Inflows for transacting active averaged $1,132 in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and relatively stable compared to the first half of the year. Monetization rate, which excludes gross profit contributions from our buy now, pay later platform was 1.43%, up 8 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by pricing changes over the past year and relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Turning to our BNPL platform, which contributed $94 million of gross profit to each of Square and Cash App in the third quarter. GMV from our NPL platform was $6.7 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Losses on consumer receivables were 0.84% of GMV, an improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
As Jack noted in his letter, in the fourth quarter, we restructured our commerce efforts moving our BNPL platform into Cash App, as we believe combining the 2 ecosystems enables us to provide consumer experiences others can't, especially for commerce. From a financial reporting perspective, moving forward, we will no longer split 50% of our BNPL platform into each of Cash App and Square. Instead, to reflect the recent organizational change, will include 100% of our BNPL platform and Casa's results, beginning in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we experienced an outage to our services across block, which impacted both Square and Cash App systems. We know the reliability of our systems is crucial for our customers and are working hard to rebuild trust. The outage lasted about 15 hours on certain products, and we estimate it impacted gross profit by less than 1% during the quarter.
Our off-line capabilities for Square and Cash App enable our customers to continue to process some transactions during this time. Looking ahead, we are accelerating our efforts to expand off-line capabilities to all of our Square products so sellers won't be worried about missing a sale and are prioritizing, building our technical infrastructure with greater redundancy and resilience. Turning now to the fourth quarter of 2023. We are shifting away from monthly trend disclosures in favor of reinstating quarterly and annual gross profit and profit guidance. We expect to continue with this updated approach until we achieve and sustain [indiscernible] 40. We expect to deliver between $1.96 billion and $1.98 billion in gross profit or 19% growth at the midpoint. For Square, we expect gross profit growth to improve from the third quarter's 15% growth rate as we lap more favorable comparisons from the prior year and we get the first full quarter benefit from pricing changes on Square invoices we implemented in the third quarter.
For the month of October, we estimate Square GTV was up 9% year-over-year. Our growth has moderated due to both GPV per seller and lower contributions from new cohorts of sellers. We believe GPV per seller has been impacted by macro trends in discretionary verticals, which continued through October. Although we've achieved positive customer acquisition through the first 3 quarters of the year, gross profit from seller cohorts onboarded over the past 2 years are not contributing as much to growth as anticipated and we're focused on evolving our go-to-market strategy to improve this. For Cash App, we expect gross profit growth to moderate on a year-over-year basis from the third quarter's 27% as we lap stronger growth from the prior year. We continue to expect all 3 components of the inflows framework to grow on a year-over-year basis in 2023.
From a product perspective, we've seen particular strength in Cash App Card and borrow as we drive continued growth in our financial services products, while we've experienced softness in growth from cash for business accounts and expect Cash App business GPV to decline in the fourth quarter. Compared to our prior expectations, growth in the fourth quarter was primarily impacted by expectations for our BNPL platform and to a lesser extent, Cash App business GPV and spare GPV. Looking at profitability. We expect to deliver $430 million to $450 million in adjusted EBITDA and $40 million to $60 million in adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter. and we are raising our full year 2023 profit guide. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.66 billion to $1.68 billion and adjusted operating income of $205 million to $225 million. These are increases of $170 million and $190 million, respectively, at the midpoint compared to our prior guide.
For the full year 2023, the midpoint of our guidance implies gross profit growth of 24%  adjusted operating income margins of 3%, leading to rule of 27 this year. This reflects meaningful margin expansion in 2023 with the midpoint of our guide reflecting 5 points of adjusted operating income margin improvement and 6 points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement compared to 2022. Turning now to our path to achieving Lula 40 in 2026. As a company, we remain focused on balancing growth and profitability. As we look longer term, we're bringing a renewed focus to efficiency, exercising discipline with our expenses and thinking critically about how we operate to drive leverage. We're going to do all this while also focusing on how we can continue strong top line growth to capture more of our addressable market. We introduced our investment framework at the beginning of the year. And today, we want to provide more context on when and how we expect to reach our goal. As Jack shared in his shareholder letter, we plan to reach rule of 40 in 2026 within at least mid-teens gross profit growth and approximately mid-20% adjusted operating income margin. This guidance is based on current trends in our business and does not factor in changes to the macro environment.
As we learn more, and trends change, our expected mix of growth and profitability may change over time as well. We will continue to monitor trends as we periodically update this view. We see a long runway for continued growth ahead. And in our long-term planning, we've refined our priorities for each of our Square and Cash App ecosystems, which are captured in Jack's shareholder letter. We believe we are still less than 5% penetrated against our $200 billion total addressable market, one which we will work to expand over time in a disciplined way with new products and audiences. In balance with our growth priorities, what you're hearing from us today is a significant commitment to profitability and efficiency across 3 key initiatives. The first area is through the efficiency of our teams. As Jack outlined in his letter, we are implementing an absolute cap on the number of people we have at our company. We expect to be a smaller team by the end of 2024 compared to where we are today.
Our cap of 12,000 people compares to our current size of just over 13,000 people as of the end of the third quarter. We believe constraining team size will enable us to be more effective in how we drive performance and service of our customers and accountability on our business strategies. We expect to reach this cap by the end of 2024 with steps towards this goal throughout the year, through a combination of performance management, centralizing teams and functions to reduce duplication and strict prioritization of our scope aligned with the priorities outlined in Jack's letter. We expect to hold firm at 12,000 people until we feel the growth of the business has meaningfully outpaced the growth of the company. With greater constraints on team size, we expect to drive meaningful leverage in stock-based compensation. as a percentage of gross profit in the years to come, starting in 2024. Second, we are also in the midst of a broad-based effort to reduce our spend across corporate overhead areas. We've identified a number of areas where we expect to find savings such as real estate, process improvements using automation, discretionary spend areas like T&E, and certain vendor relationships across software, data, cloud, consultants and contractors.
Third, within our ecosystem, as we shared in the past, we've been identifying opportunities to continue improving our cost structure as we optimize unit economics and partnerships by leveraging our scale. Moving to our initial outlook for profitability in 2024, which we expect to be our strongest year of profitability yet. While we are still in the planning process for next year, we expect significant margin expansion as we implement these constraints. We expect to achieve profitability on a GAAP operating income basis in 2024. We and to deliver $875 million in adjusted operating income, up approximately 4x compared to our 2023 guide. We expect to deliver $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an increase of more than 40% relative to our 2023 guide and to deliver strong adjusted free cash flow growth next year as well. We plan to share more about our gross profit growth expectations for 2024 during our fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Lastly, I wanted to touch on capital allocation and our focus on prioritizing shareholder return. As we progress towards Rule of 40 in the coming years, we expect our margin profile and free cash flow generation to improve, which means we can return more to shareholders over time. Today, we are announcing an initial share repurchase program of $1 billion, which will offset a portion of dilution from share-based compensation and allow us to act opportunistically when we believe our shares are undervalued. We consider share-based compensation and our financial targets as we measure our progress towards rule 40, and we want to be responsible in managing the impact of dilution as our company grows. What you hear from us today is an increased commitment to delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders as we execute on the opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Really appreciate the cost discipline comments here. Jack, a question for you. Just with all this cost framework now laid out, do you think there's still room here for innovation and outsized growth that we've come to know from block for quite some time, especially with all the changes and the focus. Can we see gross profit growth accelerate between now and 2026. We love to hear your thoughts. Yes, I think there's even more room for innovation and invention and growth. To be very frank, I believe we were getting in our own way throughout the company. As I dug in through both the lens of Square and also our investment framework, I just found a lot of silos, a lot of redundancy, a lot of kind of a lack of desire for teams to work together.
So I think a lot of what's been holding us back is cultural and that we need to reinvest in why we're building an ecosystem of ecosystem model and how powerful that is. And then number 2 is around just our structure. We had unclear decision-making throughout the company, which led to a lot of slowness, especially on the Square side. So we've been spending the past few weeks just looking at all of that and looking at all of our intersections with our foundational teams, our HR and counsel and financial teams and making sure that we approach that work very lightly so that we can focus a lot more on getting products and features to our sellers and to our cash up customers much, much faster.
So I believe we're about to enter a phase of reacceleration as we look to really hit our goals in 40. And I want to maintain that we're looking  really focus on our customer and retaining our customers as well. So that will always be a checkpoint on all the moves that we make and ultimately how we think about shipping and iterating and experimenting much more. Tien-tsin, I'd just add that in many ways, we think constraints can make us stronger as I think that's what you're hearing from Jack. And if people cap, the absolute number cap on the number of people we have is meant to address and enable these key decisions around our priorities, around our structures, centralizing teams to reduce redundancies in places enables faster decision-making with clearer accountability and help us create higher-performing teams across our ecosystems.
We'll release the team size cap constraint when we feel it constrains growth of our customers or our business or when the growth -- when our top line growth outstrips the growth of these teams. We're not there today. Our focus also is on cost areas outside of the personnel costs that don't touch customers, such as with corporate overhead. And we think there's lots of opportunity here to address to streamline our operations without impacting the customer experience. And then finally, just a word for me on our planning process. We have more to do. So far during our planning process, I think we've been appropriately focused on cost efficiency opportunities. But we have so many opportunities from a growth perspective across our ecosystems as well. some of which from a strategic prioritization perspective, Jack outlined in the letter.
So what you see here with 2026 growth, what we've shared so far really is based on our current run rate trends. And of course, we'll periodically update this as we learn more, whether it's from a macro perspective or based on our own execution and ability to accelerate. And relative to that current view of at least mid-teens growth, we'd expect cash apps growth to be slightly above that and Square's growth slightly below. But our focus is on exploring new growth initiatives and then we'll incorporate those as appropriate into our outlook over time. We have a history here of unlocking new innovation on products and across new audiences to continue driving outsized growth, and we'll continue that work. We'll take our next question from Timothy Crodo with UBS. Great I want to touch on some of the local sales efforts in the move up market for the Square ecosystem. In the context of the 12,000 headcount cap, do you feel that there is ample room to show meaningful leverage on both product development and G&A, but at the same time, again, leaving that room to really lean into sales and marketing and specifically in building out some of those local in-market sales teams to help drive seller upmarket. Yes, I do think there's I do think there's a lot of areas that we can make more efficient within Square. And I think where we've been lacking on the go-to-market is much more experimentation and experimentation driven by AI tools as well. We put a focus, as you saw in the letter, it's our #3 priority is to utilize and grow with AI.
For us, that means increasing the probability of positive outcomes for sales, customer service, which is focused a lot on retention and sales within the ecosystem and also marketing to make all of those efforts much more efficient in terms of reaching sellers where they are. And it allows us with those efficiencies to experiment a lot more. So we made a really good move with verticalization of our sales force. We're going to prioritize 2 verticals, in particular, food and beverage. And also services such as beauty. They're inherently local. Our strength is in local. And when we have that in-person -- when we have that in-person strength, whether that be an upmarket seller or a small seller, we can expand our ecosystem through that relationship.
So we're going to continue to focus on that strength. And then through all those efficiencies that we create with these new AI tools that we'll continue to roll out to our sales staff to our staff into marketing. I do believe we can experiment and experiment with new things that we haven't tried yet, such as field sales and learn from them quickly so we can iterate some really good answers. Take our next question from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. It's great to see the outlook going all the way into the Rule of 40 and 26. But really for now, we get a lot of questions on the sustainability of your square, the seller business. really just understanding the drivers to the double-digit growth we hope to see international verticalization, software services cross-sell.
Just give us a sense of what the building blocks are to keep that up to those rates? And then also just to add on to that, would be to touch on where you see the success. I know, Jack, you alluded to the company's culture working on the ecosystem. But I guess we'd love to hear more about where you see the success on ecosystem potentially kicking in, where you can see the benefit of that. Yes. So I think, first and foremost, this goes back to the prioritization that we laid out. So my first 2 weeks with Square again, running Square was focused on like what are we working on and why and doing a significant stack ring so that we -- as an organization, we know what's most important, why it's most important and how it's going to impact. The platform that we're building is critical, not only for enabling new features that have left us out of the conversation for some sellers and upmarket sellers, but also to make sure that we're realizing our ecosystem of ecosystem strategy and especially around our third-party developers so that they can continue to build next as well.
So the platform is going to be, I believe, a huge unlock for us, and we're going to be seeing those unlocks next year -- into next year. And then I do believe that the focus on these local efforts, whether that be local merchants, local sales is going to bear a lot of fruit for us. We have a very compelling product, but we've been hampered a bit in the past around experimenting with more novel approaches to sales that we see in our competitors. We're removing those constraints so that we can learn much faster and invest more deeply into the things that do actually work. I think a lot of what's holding us back from a product side is actually onboarding. We still get a pretty significant chunk of sellers from self-serve, and those are of all sizes.
Whether that be going to our website or buying hardware from an Amazon channel, for instance, and our flow or onboarding flow is, it just takes we too much time. And we're taking time away from our sellers completely. So those will be significant focus areas for us and something that I think will provide pretty quick results over the next year. I talked about in the last question. The final thing I want to point out that really sets us apart is banking. We have a number of products for sellers within banking out there. And we've seen banking -- we see banking today as more retaining our customers. And when someone comes into the Square ecosystem, signing up for a loan or a card, a debit card or a credit card or a savings account helps keep them. In the future, we do believe that this will become more and more an acquisition channel for us as well. And I think it's one of our strongest differentiators.
And one, I think we'll look back at as being the most proud of. And we have some pretty unique advantages in how we approach people banking with Square and how we enable sellers and how that ultimately positively reinforces our ecosystem and also the cash up ecosystem. So in terms of bringing these ecosystems together, I think the place to look at is going to be commerce. And the most notable within commerce is how we really bring in local comers, especially within cash to. That is our superpower. And I think the world  is going to want more local experiences. A lot of retail is becoming more and more monitor on the Internet, and people are looking for more unique experiences. And that's where we fit in. That's where our strength is. And those connections will be coming to bear more and more, especially early next year. So you will be able to see something early next year. And there's an obvious intersection between cash business and also Square and you can see that potentially as a graduation path print. But people may want to start simpler and smaller on -- and utilize cash. And then as they grow, squares there to grow with them. We'll take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. This question dovetails a little bit with a couple of the prior ones. But I wanted to ask about square go and the progress you're sort of making connecting consumers to merchants on the platform. If you can kind of talk about the progress you're making on this theme more broadly and what other ways you're exploring to create that sort of consumer demand within the app and ecosystem? Yes. I mean it's great you brought up this question because this is exactly how we're thinking about crossing the 2 ecosystems between Cash up and Square. So for those of you who are not aware of square ago, is right now focused on services, it's focused a lot on beauty. It allows you to open up to download an app [ Baltoro, ] open it up in your local city, and is this mainly in the U.S. right now and see all the services around you and book an appointment. And then all the information that would be critical for your appointment in real time.
So we're seeing it as a way to provide discovery because we've had to start it organically, and market as such and get people to download it. We have actually seen a very strong start, surprisingly, which points to the intent and the desire. Now if you imagine what that might look like in a much larger canvas with a much larger audience, such as Cash App, those are the questions that we want to explore more and that's where we think our strength really wise is when we look across these ecosystems for the use case, specifically that GO is going after, which is Discovery and discovery of merchants around you, and building up a resilient and retentive relationship for a seller and their customer. We think we can amplify that, especially with everything that we've learned with Square go being in the market thus far. We'll take our next question from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Jack, I want to ask about Square leadership. You recently took over the leadership of that business after a lysis departure. How are you thinking about that going forward? Are you looking for a replacement for Lisa? Or should we expect you to continue to be a [indiscernible] Thank you for the question. I'm going to lead Square until we had some milestones. I want to see significant return to growth. Number one, I want to see us be a lot more innovative and inventive and I want to see us connect our ecosystems better, not just with cash but also a title BD is going to enable us to go more global faster, both Square and Cash. And with title, we do believe that there's parallels between what a musician faces and what a small seller just starting out faces and a lot of the same tools are going to be useful.
So thinking -- I'm thinking about this more from a milestone perspective. And I'll know when it's time and when Square is set up in a way that we look to find a dedicated lead. But this move has enabled me to see a lot of the problems, not just within Square but across the company and work to fix them very, very quickly. So our pace of addressing some of the issues that we've had for quite some time, but may be ignored the lack of collaboration between ecosystems, the silos that we built in the past. All those are a thing of the past, and we're immediately moving to something that is much stronger. And is going to deliver a whole lot more value for our customers and everything else will follow from that. We'll take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. I wanted to ask on the path forward for Cash App gross profit and the monetization rate specifically, I think within the guidance for Q4, if we back out Afterpay, it looks like it's embedding a pretty big step up just in the pace of quarter-over-quarter gross profit dollar growth for Cash App. Amrit, if you could unpack where that improvements coming from? And then on the monetization rate, how we should think about its progression over the next year or so? And if there's anything you're able to share on product pipeline specifically there would be great. Sure. Thanks for the question. On monetization rate, what we've said in the past, which we've reiterated today as well is that we are now lapping some of the pricing adjustments that we made last year. So we expect to see greater stability in the monetization rate in Q4 relative to Q3. And as we said from a Q4 guide perspective, we also expect to see a moderation in cash up growth rate in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as we're lapping again, some of those more difficult comparisons from last year.
This is on the back though of strong results in the third quarter, with -- if you look across our inflows framework, strong growth across each of the 3 aspects of Cash App's inflows, whether it's active, which grew 11% year-over-year to $55 million on the back of continued [indiscernible] growth in our peer-to-peer network mechanisms or it's inflows per active, which were $1,132 in the quarter and were up 8% year-over-year, relatively stable with the first half of the year. Again, this one is really a factor of both our customers' spending power as well as their adoption of our products and engagement with our platform. And you see with products like Cash App Card and Cash App borrow, that we've been able to build awareness and deepen engagement with our -- with those products over time with now 22 million customers on Cash App Card and strong spend on a year-over-year basis. with cash up card as well.
And then thirdly, monetization rate, as you know, which was 1.43% in the third quarter, and that was up 8 basis points year-over-year, relatively stable from a quarter-over-quarter standpoint, which, as you noted, that monetization rate excludes the gross profit from our BNPL platform. We do expect, as I noted earlier, that monetization rate to stabilize as we lap the pricing changes over the past year. We'll take our next question from Alex Markgraff with KBCM. And all the kind of financial targets provided in the shareholder letter outside of the more explicit Rule of 40 targets. Just curious how we should evaluate some of the progress you're making on the product side of things and kind of tighten the ecosystem together as you've laid out priorities in the letter. Is there a north star to kind of orient folks around to kind of follow along with that progress? I think the biggest one to look at is going to be commerce, and it's going to be through the lens of cash up. We spent the past few months looking deeply at the Afterpay integration, restructuring, that team, moving things to cash up because a lot of the value is going to be created there, especially as we bring commerce opportunities, both Internet-based and e-commerce space to local right to the surface. So that's probably going to be the most notable in terms of connecting these ecosystems.
And as I mentioned before, the second one will be the intersection between cash out for business and the Square ecosystem. There's some obvious connection points there, especially as cash out for business customers grow and how they utilize our tools. And I think a big theme between both ecosystems is going to be around banking use cases both on the Square side and the cash upside. Actually throughout our entire ecosystem in all our business units. But those would be the 3 that I'd point  watch. We'll take our next question from Brian Kane with Deutsche Bank. I guess, Jack, my question is just when you assess the seller volumes, how much do you feel like it's pure economic volume that discretionary spend that's slowing some of the volume versus maybe competitive pressures from the market that you guys can do a better job at. And then I guess, going forward, as the comps get easier, do you factor in a little bit more of an economic slowdown in the fourth quarter, if that's in the guidance? I'll take the first part of the question. I do believe that by focusing more on the product or features and also getting to parity on particular verticals, especially within food and beverage and services will unlock a lot more growth. There's been certain features that just locked us out of conversations from restaurants, for instance. And a lot of those will be unlocked soon with like our focus on the platform. And I do believe that we can be much smarter and more efficient with our go-to-market.
Most importantly, as we've made this move to verticalization, looking for more opportunities to automate through AI, but also to experiment more. I want to make sure that we're experimenting with things that we had not tried before, smaller scale. So we can see what works and then make better informed decisions about investing more fully in them. I think there's a lot of room there. And that, of course, has to match what we're doing when a seller no matter the size gets to our website gets to our dashboard, and they find something simple, intuitive -- and most importantly, find all of the other products that we offer them, not just the one that came on board for. So the combination of that, I think, gets us back to a place of growth that we'll be very proud of. And Brian, I can help fill in just some of the numbers that we're seeing in real time and kind of what's embedded in our Q4 guide. So if we look at Square GPV in the third quarter, we grew 11% year-over-year. And again, based on our estimates, we believe, excluding the impact on the outage, growth would have been more in line with the second quarter's growth rate of 12%. And looking at October, we estimate GPV to grow 9% year-over-year. This is obviously a bit lower than our 11% from the third quarter is primarily driven from the U.S. as international markets have been more stable. But looking at some of the drivers, as we think about the 3 high-level components of Square's growth, customer acquisition, churn and same-store growth, -- we've seen stability and churn through this period, but ultimately, our growth has moderated due to both same-store growth and lower contribution from new cohorts of customers.
Now we think same-store growth, the slowdown there is relatively in line with broader macro trends across discretionary verticals and -- and that, as Jack has noted, we have work to do to shift our customer acquisition trends, which the team is laser focused on. Just to provide maybe a little bit more granularity on the same-store growth. When you look at GPV per seller, this is where we believe the recent moderation we've seen has been macro-related. -- processing volumes at existing sellers were lower in the third quarter compared to the prior year. We believe it's macro-driven as the recent results of track directionally with other third-party spend indicators that we measure when we adjust for our mix of verticals given our greater mix of discretionary spend. For instance, we don't serve grocery or gas as an example.
And in October, we saw a broad-based softness in consumer trending -- consumer spending trends in those discretionary verticals, food and drink and retail. So we're watchful here and these trends are factored into our Q4 guide. Ultimately, a lot of the work that we're doing to close feature gaps and iterate and experiment move quickly on our go-to-market is where we expect to see opportunities for growth in the future. We'll take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to follow up on kind of Cash App and the intention to grow there and provide more of banking type services for the letter, et cetera. How do you think about like the life cycle of a typical customer, a, that you're onboarding? And then clearly, you're able to deliver peer-to-peer and that seems like the easiest first thing, but then bank card or debit card, but -- and you've got some other products. But can you walk us through like how you think about the evolution of other products that those customers need and how to evolve with them and particularly as they increase their own spending capacity. Yes. So as I said in the letter, cash up is interesting and it sits at the intersection of 3 very distinct use cases, which are financial services community-based transactions, which is effectively good appear, as you mentioned, in commerce. And our approach is ultimately to bring these 3 together in a very seamless way to find an entirely new product category, which reinvents banking for our customers. So a lot of -- what we started, obviously, was peer-to-peer and it has inherent network effects and that you're receiving money from Fenza spending money to families. So it is inherently social and inherently has this incredible word-of-mouth factor. But as you get into it, as you receive money and you see that you can also get a card that you can use that card at an ATM that you can invest in Bitcoin or stocks.
You start seeing it more and more as a bigger part of your financial spend in your financial activity and financial life. And our goal now, as we mentioned, is to win more of a banking use case relationship with our existing customers. And what that means is ultimately getting to direct deposit and winning a majority of their direct deposit because that really indicates that they're seeing this as a financial home for them. And they're able to use it in entirely new ways that they wouldn't be able to in the past. So everything that we've built, again, goes back to this concept of an ecosystem where these tools positively reinforce one another. Either through new use cases or through retention or through entirely new features that they can't find elsewhere.
And that helps not only drive new customers but also helps us keep them. And I think as I said before earlier on this call, I think the one that we're really excited about because it is fundamentally new to us is around commerce. And as we really deliver against these 3 financial services community-based peer-to-peer transactions and commerce. We have something that I believe is very, very powerful and very unique in the world and continues to build on our strength and lends itself to add strength to our other ecosystems, most notably Square. And I'd just add, James, that as we see customers taking on more products within our ecosystem within Cash App, we see a multiplier effect on the amount of inflows that they bring into Cash App, whether they start as peer-to-peer and then they take on a cash up card maybe they participate on our free stock investing program or Bitcoin investing, and then eventually getting them to direct deposit their paycheck which is a significant opportunity from a primary banking relationship standpoint.
And that's been a big driver of the growth that we've seen in inflows for transacting active over time as we bring customers greater awareness around the broader set of financial services and commerce products across the ecosystem. What we saw in the third quarter was continue to drive growth in these newer inflow channels. Customers received more than $8 billion in direct deposits into their cash up accounts in the third quarter and more than $2 billion of paper money deposits in the third quarter, both grew approximately 40% year-over-year, which is nearly 2x as fast as the growth of overall inflows into Cash App.
So obviously, more opportunity for us to do here as we see the direct deposit attached still in that sort of 10% range to cash up card monthly actives through September. Although we've obviously continued to grow our cash up card attach through this period of time. We think we have an opportunity to improve both attach rates to cash up card as well as direct deposit and this broadening ecosystem of financial services products for Cash App. We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Maybe more for Jack. I think at the Analyst Day and obviously, you're very prominent talking about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is now having a renaissance. What is kind of the role of bitcoin right now in terms of your vision of connecting the ecosystem, the Holy Grail and specifically the cash app. I'm really interested in hearing your views on that. The reason we're -- we have a focus on Bitcoin is because we believe the Internet will have a native currency. We believe the Internet needs a native currency to enable micro payments globally. And we started very simply by providing an exchange for people to buy and sell Vicki. But ultimately, over time, we do believe there is a significant market and significant opportunity in remittance using Bitcoin. And that's exactly what TBD is focused on.
Not only is it a really incredible business that's quite large. But it enables our other ecosystem Square and Cash App to move much faster globally as we build out that functionality and as we build out the primitives we're working on for developers. So I do -- I believe that Bitcoin will continue to increase in value, not just in monetary value, but in use case value to the world. And I do believe that it will be a big part of the future of commerce. And since we have such an early lead in understanding on it, will be set up for success. We always knew that this was going to be a long-term play, and it still will be. But there's no doubt that the will have a native currency. And there's no doubt right now that Bitcoin is the best candidate for them. And I'll just add to that. I'll just add that, obviously, you've heard from us today an increasing focus on not only our aspirations and growth for the business, but also discipline in how we operate our business. And similarly, we'll be disciplined around our Bitcoin initiatives, holding our emerging initiatives to a specific investment envelope and will track progress relative to those key milestones on a recurring basis. We'll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. I wanted to come back to the vertical point of sale in Square. You had the gross profit of 29% there. Is that growth rate sustainable over the next few quarters? And I'm curious what percent of Square's total gross profit is now coming from vertical point of sale? And then separately, if you could just make a quick comment on what you're expecting for stock-based comp expense both this year and next year? Jason, I can start. So in the third quarter, yes, we had a strong growth in our vertical point-of-sale and developer solutions where gross profit from our vertical point-of-sale products across retail, restaurants and appointments was up 29% year-over-year in gross profit growth from our developer tools also outpaced overall Square gross profit growth. As we said last quarter, each of our vertical point-of-sale products delivered gross profit of over $100 million on an annualized basis during the third quarter as well.
And there will be key pieces of how we optimize our go-to-market strategy, improving onboarding flows and experimenting with new channels. I won't give you a specific number for vertical point of sale going forward, but we did note that we expect Square gross profit growth from a Q4 perspective to improve relative to Q3, partly because of the more favorable comparisons as well as the full quarter of a pricing movement that we take -- we took on Square invoices during the third quarter. And your second question was related to stock-based compensation. Right for 2023 and 2024, just in the context of the AOI targets? Sure. So stock-based compensation in the fourth quarter, we expect to be relatively flat relative on an absolute dollar basis relative to the third quarter. And as I said on the call earlier, we expect to drive meaningful leverage on SBC over time, starting in 2024. And here, we measure it as stock-based compensation as a percentage of gross profit as we implement the absolute number cap on the number of people that we have at the company and look to drive operational leverage and efficiencies across our business. This is a key focus area for us.
Obviously, SBC is an important tool for us and how employees are shareholders and align our incentives as owners of the business. But it's one that we're very mindful of and have deliberately included in our financial targets and adjusted operating income to be measuring and watchful of the amount of dilution. That's also part of the reason that we've got our $1 billion buyback that we've announced today is an intention to offset a portion of dilution moving forward. We'll take our next question from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Jack, I wanted to dig a little bit into the go-to-market on the Square side, connecting a few dots from earlier questions, conversations, it sounds like Square may be more interested in participating with the ISO channel to distribute Square products. Is that something on the road map? Is that something where you've experimented before? Do you believe that Square needs to embrace the ISO channel more to scale against competitors? We have experienced -- we've experimented with it before from a financial partnership perspective. Specifically, we had a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and gave out Square readers at all of their branches as a distribution point. not close off to it. I think the most important thing is like we need to experiment more and we need to experiment with different models. I think the answer is not going to be generalized. It's going to be specific to the vertical. This looks different in terms of distribution for a restaurant than it does for services and beauty and then that's completely different from retail.
So I think the most important point to take away is like we want to be open to a lot more experimentation that's on a smaller scale for a bit of time so that we can see what's working and then invest in a much heavier way. We are looking more deeply at just some immediate experiments such as contracts which you're seeing some early success from some local campaigns, more partnerships and specifically referrals, which we think there's a lot to it, and it kind of harkens back to our earliest day in terms of how square spread, which was entirely by word-of-mouth referrals helps push out even more. And then just making sure that we're focused on the experience the sellers have when they get into the service or when they go to our website. So those, I think, are the biggest drivers. And we'll take one more question, and we'll take that question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. I appreciate you sneaking me in here at the end. Amrita, the Cash App monetization framework has always been really helpful. Could you unpack a little bit sources of monetization within Cash App. I'm thinking specifically about Instant Deposit versus interchange and how that's changed over time and how you think about the Instant Deposit product, in particular, in a real-time payments world. Sure. Thanks for the question, Andrew. We've had a growing set of products across Cash App and some of which are free and some of which are monetized and have grown the pace of monetization of some of the products outside of Instant Deposit even faster than instant deposits. So the mix of the business relying on instant deposit has declined over time despite the fact that, that continues to be a growing product for us and has  use cases around customer utility.
Of course, our focus is as much as possible, delivering value within our ecosystem across a number of products. And that's where you've seen the strong growth of things like Cash App Card, with $22 million, 40% attached to our 55 million monthly active base and where we've seen strong growth from per active spend perspective which continues into the third quarter with growth on a year-over-year basis there. So -- and along with greater utility around, obviously, peer-to-peer within the broader ecosystem of Cash App, the ability to deposit paper money deposits ability to receive your direct deposit, the ability to extract money through an ATM, has the ability to invest money, the ability now to save money within Cash up. And all of these provide a greater utility for a lot of these inflows that are staying within the cash up ecosystem are moving throughout the CashAp ecosystem.
Now what we've seen historically when we look outside at other countries where instant rails are available. For instance, in the U.K., where Square also has an instant transfer product as the attach rate in those areas for that product continue to be strong and generally about as strong as what we see in the U.S., meaning that people are willing to pay for seamless, integrated product experiences that provide them with value. So obviously, this is one that we'll continue to watch. But we've been pleased with the continued growth of Instant Deposit, but even more pleased with the growth of the other products across Cash App. Thank you. And that does conclude Block's third quarter earnings call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.
We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook and guidance as well as our long-term targets and goals, and we may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, a discussion during this call of Cash App's banking services refer to those offered through our bank partners.
Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40. With Rule of 40, we are evaluating the sum of our gross profit, profit growth and adjusted operating income margins.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter and our historical financial information spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, I focused our shareholder letter on how we're going to grow Square through 4 priorities. This quarter, our letter is about Cash App's strategy and our goal to become one of the top providers of banking services to households in the U.S. If you haven't yet, please read that letter for details. As we did last quarter, to maximize time for your questions, we're going to focus our opening remarks on Amrita providing more details on the financials.
Over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. There are 2 broad topics I'd like to cover. First, where we've been, in particular, our performance for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023 where we saw strong growth and meaningful improvements in profitability, driving progress against our investment framework.
Second, where we're headed, our expectations for 2024, our guidance for the first quarter, recent trends we've seen and ways we'll look to drive improvements on Rule of 40.
Let's start with our strong growth and efficiency in 2023 as we continue to drive toward our Rule of 40 target in 2026.
We ended 2023 with $7.5 billion in gross profit for the year, up 25% year-over-year or 24% on a combined company basis. Our heightened focus on efficiency helped us improve profitability during the year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $1.79 billion, up 81% year-over-year, and 24% margin on gross profit, our highest ever. Adjusted operating income, which as a reminder includes expenses related to stock-based compensation and depreciation, was $351 million, our highest yet, representing a 5% margin on gross profit and compared to a loss of $145 million a year ago. Cash flow generation also improved this year as adjusted free cash flow for 2023 was $515 million, up from negative $346 million a year ago.
Taking the components together, we achieved Rule of 29 in 2023, on a combined company basis, which was a few points higher than our guidance as of the third quarter.
The other component of our investment framework is gross profit retention, which shows our ability to retain a customer over time and is an indication of whether our products, pricing and support are valued by our customers.
During 2023, Square and Cash App each achieved positive gross profit retention in aggregate across our annual cohorts. Square cohorts saw strength in software and banking, offset softness in processing volumes during the year. Cash App benefited from on inflows per active, driven by financial services products and monetization from pricing changes.
In the fourth quarter, gross profit was $2.03 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $562 million and adjusted operating income was $185 million, both higher than our guidance, driven by continued discipline in discretionary spend.
On a GAAP basis, operating loss of $131 million was impacted by a goodwill impairment of $132 million, severance expenses of $70 million, primarily related to our recent organizational restructuring, and lease impairment restructuring expenses of $34 million. Also as a reminder, starting in the fourth quarter, we restructured our commerce efforts by moving our BNPL platform fully into Cash App. We are reflecting this change in our fourth quarter and 2023 gross profit results as well as prior periods. Let's get into the drivers for each of Square and Cash App in the fourth quarter.
Square generated $828 million in gross profit, up 18% year-over-year. Square GPV was up 10% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. While we experienced positive acquisition and stable churn of existing sellers compared to prior periods, GPV per seller continued to be affected by slower discretionary spend in the U.S., and consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've also seen a lower gross profit contribution from ramping cohorts of sellers.
Within our card-not-present volumes, we saw solid growth in online volumes, up 11% year-over-year. This was partially offset by a decline in manual-keyed entry, or MKE, volumes, where a seller manually enters card information into a payment device either in person or over the phone. This has been an ongoing trend, with MKE volume now representing just 13% of Square GPV in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to more than 16% 2 years prior. We expect the headwind from MKE transactions to remain for some time, although its impact should moderate as we expect software-enabled payments to become an increasing driver of our business.
While Square GPV growth has moderated, driven by GPV per seller and MKE declines, our banking products and vertical point-of-sale solutions delivered strong growth, with gross profit from these products up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively.
Cash App generated $1.18 billion in gross profit in the fourth quarter, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Looking at the components of the inflows framework, which as a reminder, does not include our BNPL platform. As of December, Cash App had 56 million monthly transacting actives, up 9% year-over-year. Inflows per transacting active averaged $1,137 in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year, driven by increasing adoption of our financial services products over the past year. Cash App Card continued to increase its scale and introduced customers to financial services within Cash App. Cash App Card reached 23 million monthly actives, representing more than 40% of our total active base in December and growing 20% compared to the prior year, more than twice as fast as overall monthly transacting actives.
Monetization rate was 1.48%, up 9 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Improvement from the third quarter was driven by a number of factors, including an increase in Bitcoin gross profit from pricing changes implemented during the quarter.
Turning to our BNPL platform, which contributed $242 million of gross profit to Cash App in the fourth quarter. GMV from our BNPL platform was $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by strength across our Pay-in-Four offering as well as single-use payments, which allows customers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia to shop via the Afterpay merchants we don't have a direct relationship with and pay using BNPL.
Losses on consumer receivables were 1% of GMV, consistent with historical ranges. As Jack included in his letter, integrating commerce payments tools is a key focus for us next year, and we see powering BNPL through Cash App Card as a significant opportunity.
Turning to our guidance. We have committed to achieving our Rule of 40 target in 2026. Our primary objective in 2024 is to deliver an improvement from the Rule of 29 we achieved in 2023, on a combined company basis.
To achieve this, we have put forward an initial guidance that we intend to exceed by at least 1 point of outperformance during the year, either on gross profit growth or adjusted operating income margin or both. As we did last year, we are working to identify growth opportunities and additional efficiencies that further progress us towards Rule of 40.
For the full year 2024, we are expecting at least $8.65 billion in gross profit or at least 15% growth year-over-year. By ecosystem, we expect Cash App to grow faster than Square, but for growth to moderate from 2023 as we lap pricing changes and other initiatives that improved our cost structure. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we are focusing our efforts on driving engagement through product adoption and product velocity.
Within Square, we expect software and integrated payments and banking to be continued drivers of growth. We believe the work we put towards our new strategic priorities and the investment behind several go-to-market initiatives can improve seller acquisition over the next few years.
On profitability, we are raising our full year guidance and now expect adjusted operating income of at least $1.15 billion compared to our preliminary guide of $875 million and adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.63 billion versus $2.4 billion. This represents year-over-year margin expansion of approximately 9 points on adjusted operating income and 7 points on adjusted EBITDA.
As we continue to focus on managing costs, we expect to achieve leverage on share-based compensation expenses as a percentage of gross profit compared to 2023. This guidance on growth and profitability is based on the visibility we have into our business today with no significant changes to the macro environment.
Lastly, our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. We expect to deliver between $2 billion to $2.02 billion in gross profit or 17% growth at the midpoint. For Square, we expect gross profit and GPV to moderate slightly compared to the fourth quarter's 18% and 10%, respectively. So far this year, weather has periodically impacted Square GPV in the U.S., and particularly in January, where we saw it drive a 3- to 4-point moderation in growth, as certain regions experienced impacts to in-person volumes, particularly within food and drink and retail.
For Cash App, we expect growth to be driven by actives and inflows per active in the first quarter. We expect the gross profit growth rate to moderate compared to the fourth quarter's 25% as we'll be lapping tougher comparisons.
Looking at profitability, we plan to deliver both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth with adjusted operating income of $225 million to $245 million and adjusted EBITDA of $570 million to $590 million. The respective midpoints represent margins of 12% and 29% and year-over-year growth of 361% and 57%, demonstrating our continued focus on driving profitable growth.
With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. So you acted really quickly here on costs. I want to ask how quickly you can attack growth in '24. Really, product velocity is the question here. In your letter, Jack, you talk about closing product gaps in Cash App and reclaiming leadership in engineering and design of Square. How quickly can you get there? And when might we see some measurable benefits to growth in '24? Yes. Across the board in every one of our business units, we've been going through an exercise in order to simplify how we work so we can move much faster. And that's inclusive of Square and Cash App and TIDAL and TBD. So you should expect a much higher product velocity across the board.
With Square, in particular, we've been doing a lot of platform work. This is our #1 priority to ensure that we can move much faster with some features and future gaps that have held us back from certain customers, namely with food and bev. We have, for example, pre-auth coming this year. And when those platform elements unlock, it's just kind of unlock a whole bunch of speed across restaurants, retail, services. And I believe we'll be able to push really hard and see really good outcomes.
On the Cash App, where we're going to benefit a lot from this, the focus is on the banking relationships. We've been focused a lot of our -- we've been pulling the thread, I should say, on banking relationships for quite some time. And we have proven out the model with the success of the Cash App Card. And it's really focused a lot of our efforts in order to, as I said in the shareholder letter, bank our base. So our strategy is to make sure that we are the best choice and the first choice for anyone looking who's making under $150,000 to see Cash App as their primary bank. And that has to do -- one of the biggest signals is that the majority of their direct deposit is going into Cash App.
So we're going to move very fast because we have a much more focused road map and a road map against banking in particular. And as we said in the letter in a lot of detail, I think we'll see very positive outcomes from that focus, and it allows us to go to parts 2 and 3 of that strategy, which is on families and also becoming a social bank. Cash App is inherently social.
We have this incredible network effect through starting with peer-to-peer. And we have this opportunity to make it even more social and really look deeply at the local payments and local commerce, in particular. And that's where the intersection with Square comes into play. We're going to start putting our Square customers first and foremost in the Cash App, and you really see the power of our combined ecosystems and a combined network. And I'd just add, Tien-Tsin, just to tie this together with our 2024 outlook. Our guidance philosophy is to guide based on our current run rate trends in our business, what we're seeing in the business quarter-to-date as of earnings and the known expense and growth levers that we've incorporated into our plan entering the year. So a lot of the refocused strategy and key growth initiatives that we're discussing are not included in our 2024 expectations, given how recent they are. And they provide us with the opportunities to outperform relative to this initial guidance.
Whether it's a product platform or go-to-market experimentation within the Square business or the Cash App's bank the base strategy, we're hard at work at each of those elements, and we expect those to deliver for us as we get into later into the year in 2025 and beyond but still early days. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo from UBS. I want to dig in a little bit to the Square distribution approach. You've talked about building out the vertical outbound sales teams and also potentially experimenting with local in-market sales teams, and also saw in the shareholder letter, you mentioned the revamped referral program. But maybe you could expand upon how Square views the potential to partner with banks and ISOs, so adding bank partners for distribution, adding ISOs to get broader coverage across the nation and the various considerations and how you sort of view the potential for that in the future. Yes. We're definitely open on this. We tried this in the past in our first few years as a company. As many of you know, JPMorgan Chase was one of our earliest investors, our Series B. And we had Square readers in every single branch in the United States. It wasn't that effective. I think that particular strategy just did not work because the expectation of the customer coming in, especially for business banking, for whatever reason, was off.
That's not to say that all these channels don't work. Obviously, it does work for a few of our competitors. And we're certainly open to them and open to exploring them. I think the biggest thing that is really important for Square is certainly the -- our go-to-market approach, but our product itself is where I want to put a lot of our focus. One of the things that we're doing soon is we're -- right now, we have about 4 or 5 apps in the App Store. It's pretty confusing to direct people to the App Store. And when they get there really, it's a function of Apple's search results as to whether they find us or not, the app they need, especially if they're a restaurant or retail or a services organization.
So what we're going to do is we're going to go back to having one app. It's just going to be called Square. And we can easily say to anyone that you can go to Square or you can download Square. You have everything you need. The interface and navigation and features will dynamically shift based on the type of merchant you say you are and shift over time as you get more and more sophisticated with the software. And we can also obviously help folks with our sales team to guide them through. But I think generally, it would be a whole lot simpler. We have massive success with self-serve. And as we do add referral engines and be more targeted with them, specifically within food and beverage and restaurants, having a much simpler way to get the app, to use it, and to get up and started, whether you're a micro merchant, just one person, sole proprietorship, or all the way up to multi-location, multi-country. So that's the goal, and we'll realize all that this year.
And I think that's really going to unlock a ton of growth and make anything that we do from a distribution standpoint, whether it be through ISOs or bank partnerships, or what I think is more important, through our targeted channels for restaurants and services and retail, it's going to make it that much better. And most importantly, we'll focus on retaining, which is a big aspect.
The other thing that I think will help us retain, which is a core part of our strategy #4 is banking. We have 9 products within the market. They're only going to get stronger. It's the thing that truly differentiates us from our peers. And we not only have an ecosystem that serves our entire business, but we have the equivalent of a business banking account. Just like there's JPMorgan Chase branches that they're going to in the past, they can get a card, they can get a credit card, they can get a line of credit, they can get a loan as we've been doing for quite some time. And that it's integrated all into one stack with one app download is hugely unique and also hugely important to our sellers. So I think it's going to be amazing. Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Just to hone in a little bit more on Direct Deposit. It obviously is moving to the forefront around Cash App for your strategy on it. And look, I mean, we obviously see a notable set of banking assets you've been able to package for your MAUs. But if you could just expand on what you see actually driving adoption or accelerated adoption of Direct Deposit now, getting that 2 million to, say, 5 million or 10 million users versus, I know there's been some prior attempts to make that happen. And then, Jack, maybe just what time frame would you consider a success on this front in terms of an incremental maybe 5% or 10% of Cash App users taking on Direct Deposit? I think the biggest driver is going to be easy, connected banking features that just work and that people can trust. We want to make sure that people see Cash App as reliable, as dependable, as something that they trust on their full direct deposit of their paycheck with. And trust is the one input, but a big factor of that is the output. So what can I actually do with it? And the Cash App Card has been one of our most successful products within Cash App. It's extremely easy to get a card. It's extremely easy to personalize it, to use it, to change it, to give it to family members.
So there's a lot that's attractive there. There are some gaps that we're missing that traditional banks offer that we do not. But really, the road map is filling those gaps and doing so in an intuitive, well-designed way that feels fresh and benefits from technology to give time back to the customer. And then as people see that and as people use it and they talk with their friends and their family about it, that's the growth. That's how Direct Deposit grows.
And people, again, trust us more and more to put more of their paycheck in the Cash App because they know they can use it in very traditional ways that are reliable but also entirely new ways, and it all fits together perfectly and seamlessly. So expectations, we want to move as fast as possible. The fact that we're no longer focusing on expanding globally for right now, that we're focusing on banking our base in the United States, it's going to allow us to move much faster. And I think we'll see outcomes much faster than we have traditionally.
And this is the base foundation for our other 2 priorities, which is moving more upmarket with families, which we've seen some early positive signs from, and then really going after -- being a social bank starting with peer-to-peer, but expanding beyond that and really getting in the neighborhoods and local communities and focusing a lot more on commerce. So all these tools add up to a desire, we believe, to put more and more money with Cash App and use it there, and hopefully, more and more becomes 100%. And Darrin, just to go a little bit deeper on some of the actual features that we think will be compelling for customers, we've got a bunch of features. We're rolling out more features to give customers an experience beyond what's available to the market today. So today, we think our Direct Deposit offering is differentiated with no fees or minimums, early direct deposit availability and the benefit of our active money being in the broader Cash App ecosystem where they can send, spend on Cash App Card or Cash App Pay, invest it, et cetera.
We're also focused on the new products and features that drive engagement. So for example, we recently launched free overdraft coverage up to a certain amount. We introduced yield on savings balances and allowed for automatic paycheck distributions. So we're prioritizing launching products that customers expect from us before they start bringing in more of their money. Today, it's about 2 million paycheck deposit actives as of December, about 3% of our monthly actives, but this will be one of the key KPIs along with broader inflows per active that we're focused on driving forward as part of our bank the base strategy. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. I think your 2024 outlook implies OpEx growth of about 4%. Would you just discuss your confidence in being able to achieve that at least 15% gross profit growth against the backdrop of this tight cost management? And then what signals are you looking for when deciding whether to invest in OpEx more aggressively again? I can start maybe with a reminder of kind of the key areas of operating expense leverage that we've been pursuing and which we believe still continue to have opportunity against. And that those constraints are clarifying for us actually in supporting further scoping prioritization and operational excellence in how our teams operate. But the key categories being, one, personnel. Obviously, you heard from us last quarter our constraint around people, which at the 12,000-person cap, which we're currently operating under and expect to for some time. That unlocks a tremendous amount of leverage for us both from a non-GAAP operating expense perspective as well as leverage from an SBC perspective, and you see that reflected in our expectations for 2024.
And that constraint, again, is what leads to stronger prioritization and focus in the areas that will impact our customers the most and ultimately lead to profitable growth. The other key focus area for us is around corporate overhead expenses, where we've already seen opportunity to get more efficient, whether it's things like third-party spend food vendors, real estate, T&E, data and cloud fees, professional fees, et cetera. we have an opportunity to continue to refine how we operate to make sure that we are operating with the greatest amount of discipline, constraint and efficiency.
And then as we look longer term, of course, there are new technologies like AI that we can be leveraging in-house not only in terms of the product that we're serving our customers but that deliver efficiency to our teams internally, whether it's customer service or sales or engineering and design. And then, of course, structural costs, which we've already made some headway on with some partner renegotiations last year, but we'll continue to pursue in terms of unit economic improvement across our base of products. So there are a number of different areas for us that we've already been digging deep into and for us to continue to do that, that actually support our opportunity to continue to grow our platforms and grow our overall gross profit. Sorry, the 2 things I would add to that is it's just to emphasize what Amrita said about AI. I mean, you all have been hearing AI constantly in all these calls in terms of efficiency, but it's going to be extremely impactful for us as we look at everything that we're doing and all the tools that we're building and how much more productive it makes all of our engineers, and I think in the very near future, our designers as well. That allows us to learn much faster. It allows us to ship faster, allows us to correct mistakes much faster and really be ahead of the market where we think our strength is, which is creativity and bringing all these very complex systems together.
And the second thing is about 3 years ago, we were more in a mode of letting as many flowers bloom as possible. And it created a bunch of inefficiencies between all of our ecosystems. We had a lot of duplication between Square and Cash App, and these tools and these costs just weren't really great at all. And we've taken -- we've done a ton of work to clean that up and I believe there's even more to go. So I believe we can actually move much faster, shift much faster because of those 2 things and because we don't have such a dependence on this multitude of tools that are all different but effectively doing the same thing or solving the same use case. Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. I want to ask about Cash App and commerce. Cash App Pay is growing rapidly although from a small base. Can you give us some color on the composition of these volumes, for example, within Square merchants or online? You've had some very interesting merchant-acquired partnerships to enable Cash App Pay recently as a payment option online. What are some of the most salient things you can do to kind of grow Cash App Pay penetration in e-comm? And also just related to Cash App overall, can you also talk about your compliance investments in Cash App as we grow banking? Yes, I'll start off, Harshita, on Cash App Pay. We're really excited about the progress that we've seen over the past year and how quickly we've been able to drive growth as we've expanded to more and more merchants. This is a key part of how we integrate commerce tools more broadly in the Cash App over the next several years. We see Cash App Pay as a seamless way for customers to spend, especially online and provides more ways for our customers to spend beyond using Cash App Card. We ended December with 3 million monthly actives and $2.5 billion in annualized GPV, which has more than tripled since what we reported to you last June.
Growth here has been driven through recent partnerships such as DoorDash, Adyen, Stripe. We have a strong pipeline as well of large merchants we're exploring to continue to expand our reach. Of course, Afterpay's enterprise sales team has been critical here and allowed us to scale quickly by leveraging existing relationships and the quality of their sales organization. I think the second part of your question was about Cash App commerce, or can you repeat the other -- did we answer your question, Harshita? Yes. So just the compliance investment just more broadly within Cash App, not just related to Cash App Pay, especially as you focus now more into banking? Sorry, compliance investment more broadly across the company? No, within Cash App. I was just kind of thinking about some recent media reports suggesting regulatory probe into Cash App. Yes, absolutely. So compliance, security fraud risk. These are all areas that are constant iterations. We're never going to build a perfect system where we can only focus on velocity and speed. And any areas that we've had in the past, our goal right now is to make sure that we crack them quickly and that we continue to build those learnings into the future. And then we stay 10 steps ahead of any adversaries.
And that's been a big focus for us for years. Well, we put even more emphasis on this right now because we do want to earn more trust with the use case of banking and being the primary bank for people. And obviously, this is a big, big part of having that trust. We want people to trust that if they put 100% of their paycheck into Cash App's Direct Deposit and utilize it, that it's sound and they can do everything that they want without restriction and that it just works. So this is a significant investment for us, and we'll continue to grow. But we have entirely new technologies available to us now that makes us work even more efficient, much better, and we can be far more exhaustive and far more precise in our approach than we have ever in the past. Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams from Jefferies. I want to follow up on the product pipeline in Cash App, especially around commerce and the new products you expect to layer in this year. In the letter, Cash App Card was mentioned as a way to distribute BNPL, which I think that's something we haven't heard from you guys before, if you could dig into that. And then just how much contribution at least within what you're expecting for Cash App that you're baking in from some of these newer initiatives around commerce within the full year outlook. Yes. I mean, so we've been doing a bunch of work since we first acquired Afterpay. As you all know, we had more or less split the org between Square and Cash App. We realized last year that, that was incorrect, and that we should put the majority of it within Cash App because that's where the greatest benefit is going to be. And that's, first and foremost, in discovery in Cash App and discovery of commerce, whether that be global Internet commerce, e-commerce or more local commerce such as Square merchants.
But we have an incredible asset in Afterpay and we have an incredible asset in the Cash App Card and that distribution. So we're looking for all the tools, all the financial tools that Afterpay has created. We'll be right within Cash App and right within the card. And as I talked about on past calls, you can imagine, just as you would on the Cash Card today, in the app, you can turn on Boost and get offers and see these things in real time and interchange them. We want that same sort of feeling for buy now, pay later on the card itself. And this opens the door for our customers to treat every single merchant that they go to as a buy now, pay later entity, which is pretty awesome and pretty cool and we're excited about it.
So there's a lot there with the financial tools within Cash App. And also within the Afterpay app itself within Australia, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow and to push. But this will be a year of much, much tighter integration and much more visibility of the Afterpay tools and the use cases within Cash App itself. And in terms of how we think about our outlook with respect to some of these newer products that we'll be launching later this year and into next year, as I said earlier, our guide is based on -- primarily on our current run rate trends in the business and known elements around expenses and growth levers. And typically, we're moving quickly to improve our product velocity, but typically, as we launch these products, they take time to ramp. So I'd expect to see greater benefit later in the year but primarily heading into 2025 and beyond as we move quickly against these commerce and banking and financial services products within Cash App. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Do your broader banking aspirations require you to do anything different on the banking license side? Or asked differently, should your efforts on the banking side be successful, can you still leverage partner banks or do you need to go with direct licenses? Great question. It doesn't necessarily require us to do anything differently. We do have, as far as financial services, our bank, and we're very excited about the expanded potential use cases that we can utilize for, in addition to the ones today which are around loans. So we want to make sure that the bank itself like can help us provide more efficiency and provide speed, much tighter integration so that we can have much more cohesive experiences.
And it doesn't limit us from using partner banks. You can think of these as a portfolio. We can use multiple banks, including our own, to do various things in the future, and we have a lot more flexibility as that comes more online. And what's fully going to rule all this is the product experience that we can offer to people. And obviously, that we can do it with new technology that makes it easier and much more profitable than a traditional bank could. So that is our focus and we don't see any significant changes in how we build products coming up. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski from Autonomous Research. I think you mentioned in the quarterly letter that the 2022 and 2023 Square cohorts are tracking to a 6 to 7 quarterly payback period. How are you guys thinking about the payback period for 2024, 2025? And if you can comment on how you're thinking about marketing spend in Square for the year, that would be great. Sure. Happy to kick off on what we've seen recently and what we expect moving forward. We orient primarily to ROI the returns that we see over a 4-year period in how we go to market across the Square ecosystem. And as we're able to attach more products to our customers, as they're able to grow on our platform, that extends the lifetime value of these customers and ultimately what we're able to invest into go-to-market initiatives to bring customers into the Square ecosystem.
So I would argue more to ROIs where we've seen healthy ROIs at sort of 3x over 4 years in the past, and we'll continue to focus on ROI moving forward. Across our initiatives, it takes a key focus for us is the pace of experimentation across both sales and marketing. We're going to orient more of our spend in marketing to proven channels, but we'll have a number of our efforts from a team perspective on trying new things in small ways so that we can iterate rapidly and learn, whether that's in sales where we've now deployed contracts or where we're taking a local approach with referrals, or we're bundling our products differently as we did with a restaurant's essentials bundle to create simple pricing, one simple price for a set of customers across the restaurant vertical.
We are doing a number of different things to drive cohesion and how a customer can onboard into the Square ecosystem. And as Jack mentioned earlier, some of the product initiatives around our single app strategy and our platform initiatives are key unlocks for us as we think about more efficient onboarding of customers into the broader ecosystem. The only thing I'd add there is we're -- as I said in the letter, we're doing a reorg with Square back to a functional organization. And one of the results of that is going to bring -- is to bring product and marketing much, much closer together. This is how we started the company. And we believe that the gaps that we had in the recent past really hurt our aspirations and our execution. And the reason why is we want to make sure that there's a very, very smooth ramp from any marketing that we do, and that would be targeting -- targeted are more out-of-home and the actual sign-up flow, and the customer experience that they come -- they get when they come to the website or when they get in a number to call one of our sales folks. So the organizational structure, I think, will help illuminate a lot of the issues we had in the past, and we're focused on really making sure that they work together a whole lot better so we can move much faster. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Wanted to ask about the Cash App monetization rate. I think it was up 5 basis points sequentially. If I recall correctly, I think you thought it would be more stable sequentially. So I guess what kind of surprised and drove the outperformance of the monetization rate? I think you called out Bitcoin and pricing, so just curious exactly on the pricing side where that's coming from and then any color on how monetization rate will trend as we go through 2024. Sure. So what we saw in the fourth quarter was a 9 basis point improvement year-over-year and 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter. To your question specifically on quarter-over-quarter, there are a couple of different factors at play but the primary ones were around Bitcoin. And within Bitcoin, it was both the pricing of the product as well as the price appreciation of Bitcoin itself, which benefited monetization rate on a sequential basis.
As we look forward, we see opportunities in 2024 around actives and inflows per active as the primary drivers of growth for Cash App in 2024. As we look longer term, we see opportunities around monetization rate as we go deeper in the financial services ecosystem and we attach more of these products to our customer base. As our customers take on more and more products themselves, we see an opportunity to grow monetization rate. But as we'll be lapping some of these pricing changes coming up in 2024, we don't expect a meaningful change in monetization rate and certainly not at the meaningful level that we saw during 2023. Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. I'm curious, could you walk us through the mechanics on the yield, the savings product or direct deposit users and Cash App? And Amrita, I'm curious your thesis on, I guess, the relative unit economics for that particular product and how you see that evolving. Yes. The overall strategy is that as customers save more of their funds with us, they make us more of their primary banking partner, and then we can offer them more financial services, some of which we monetize. We have had a history of thinking about our ecosystem in terms of the entirety of the value we provide, with some products being free, like our tax product, our investing product, our peer-to-peer product when you use a debit card, and some products being monetized.
And with the savings launch where we're offering a yield for customers who direct deposit with us, a strong yield for customers who direct deposit with us at 4.5% and a more modest yield for customers who use Cash App Card, and about 1.5%, what we're providing is an incentive for customers to bring more inflows into Cash App. And we see a strong correlation with inflows into Cash App driving gross profit and customers being more engaged with the broader set of products across Cash App.
What we've seen so far, look, it's early days of these savings balances. We have balances from Cash App savings accounts total $200 million as of the end of the fourth quarter, representing 6% of overall customer funds. But as we've introduced more recently the yield, we'll be looking to more opportunities to attract savings and inflows and ultimately, engagement with a broader suite of financial services. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. I was just looking at Page 18 of the shareholder letter showing the Cash App gross profit mix. I think at least some of that is a new disclosure which we appreciate. It shows you become a lot less dependent on instant deposit, financial services becoming a much bigger part of the pie. I think it was 38% in 2023. So I'm just wondering as you execute on the bank the base strategy, is there any kind of target in mind in terms of the percent of Cash App gross profit that may come from financial services, say, by 2026 as you pursue the Rule of 40 that year? And just separately, Amrita, real quick, any comments on free cash flow for 2024? Sure. Look, financial services at 38% in 2023 as a percent of catch-up gross profit versus 29% 2 years prior is obviously a key growth vector for us within Cash App, as you note in our new disclosure in the shareholder letter. And it's one that we're going to continue to focus on as we grow out the broader set of products, as you've been hearing today and as you saw in Jack's note in the shareholder letter. So that is one that I would continue to focus on. We still have seen growth in instant deposit and other parts of the ecosystem but just not as fast as some of the financial services products. So we'll continue to lean in there.
With respect to free cash flow, I'd orient you to the trend lines across EBITDA. Obviously, the free cash flow metric is a different calculation, but it's directionally where we expect to grow our profitability on an EBITDA basis. We also would expect to grow our free cash flow over time. Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Just wanted to ask a question on the seller business. It looks like the growth rate in the U.S. decelerated a little bit but international continues to look quite good. And just wondering how we should think about the trajectory of U.S. versus international, anticipate the mix. And any sense as to in what time frame particularly the U.S. could be bottoming and where you think you can get that growth rate back to, especially as you focus on product, et cetera, as Jack's talked about? Yes. U.S. growth is a big focus for us. And a lot of our focus right now is going to be on restaurants, food and beverage. And as I said earlier, like I think there are significant product gaps that are -- we have line of sight into that will be unlocked this year, that we can move much, much faster on from a development and product standpoint, that we'll see results from and much greater outcomes.
And we'll continue to push around the world, of course. But I really want to make sure that we advance even faster than we have in the past on the U.S. And I think that's really a function of all the changes that we're making with the org, with how the product is packaged and how we think about onboarding, in particular, and making it super easy for people and then putting on a much stronger go-to-market on top of that. Yes. And I'd just add that in addition to our focus areas in the U.S., we can benefit from those product initiatives in international markets as well. And we're enthusiastic about what we see in the markets outside the U.S. We think we're less than 1% penetrated in those markets that we're currently in outside the U.S. with a long runway for growth. And we saw GPV growth in the fourth quarter in the markets outside the U.S. grow 26% year-over-year, with gross profit growth about 28% year-over-year, now representing 13% of Square's gross profit. And obviously, that's grown over time. So we have opportunities to continue to refine and push our product velocity in the U.S. and ultimately, that will help with the significant TAM opportunity that we see outside the U.S. as well. We will now take our last question from Andrew Bauch from Wells Fargo Securities. Just wanted to revisit the Direct Deposit assumptions that you're kind of making. I mean it's nice to see that the 6x data point for those who are depositing $2,000-plus. But can you give us a sense on what the path to increasing that paycheck direct deposit mix ultimately looks like in 2024 and 2025? Are there certain unlocks you kind of need to achieve to see that ramp? I think the biggest unlocks are going to be products. And we want to make sure that it's super easy to get into Cash App and to see what you can do with it from a banking relationship standpoint. Like I want to put my money into something that I trust, first and foremost, and has significant utility and that the utility is broad but also highly connected and works very fluidly. And that's what we want Cash App to be.
We have a lot of the pieces there. We're going to spend this year, really focused on making sure they sing and they really work in a way that makes people feel great in the same way that like designing a Cash App Card feels, we want that across the board for every single one of our features. And it really starts, as I said before, with trust. We need to make sure that Cash App is seen as reliable, as dependable and with a great customer base on top of it. And this is a constant iteration to make sure that we earn that trust. But then it really comes back to like now that I have inputs, what are the outputs and what can I do with my money on Cash App? Certainly, I would be able to do in a traditional bank, but what's the plus-plus? What can I do more of within Cash App than I could do on another traditional bank?
It really starts, I mean, as you know, with peer-to-peer and the fact that it's an app and it just works and it's fast and easy and meets my expectations and hopefully, in many cases, exceeds them. But there's a lot of work to get that right and a lot of connections we can make to that. And a lot of it comes back down to just new functionality on top of what we already have. And Andrew, I'd point you to Cash App Card as well as a key proof point for us as we bring more awareness to our financial services capabilities and ultimately to Direct Deposit. In the same way that peer-to-peer is the awareness driver for overall Cash App, we see Cash App Card as the awareness driver for our financial services and banking products and Direct Deposit.
What we've seen with Cash App Card, now at 23 million monthly actives, growing twice as fast as our overall monthly actives base at over 40% attached, is that we're at true scale in terms of the ability to drive awareness here. We surpassed $1 billion in gross profit in 2023 for Cash App Card. And that growth was 3x higher than instant deposit, where customers are sending their funds outside of Cash App, so giving people more reasons to keep their funds within Cash App.
And what we've seen in terms of the behaviors and the engagement on Cash App Card has been healthy not only with the growth in actives but also growth in spend per active, which means that we saw meaningful growth in overall spend on Cash App Card in 2023. And finally, point you to that strong engagement where customers using our banking products are ultimately more engaged with Cash App Card monthly actives bringing in over 2x more inflows, 2.3x more inflows and those Direct Deposit monthly actives bringing in 7x more inflows than a peer-to-peer active. So there's a key thing, the kernel here that's working with Cash App Card that we can then bring people into the deeper suite of financial services and ultimately to Direct Deposit.

And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today. We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from conference call participants.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward looking. These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook, strategy and guidance as well as our long-term targets and goals. We may decide to shift our priorities or move away from these targets and goals at any time. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Further discussion during this call of Cash App's banking services referred to those offered by our bank partners. Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40. With Rule of 40, we are evaluating the sum of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margin.
Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter and our historical financial information spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
Finally, this call, in its entirety, is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. In the last 2 quarters, I focused my shareholder letter on our priorities for Square and Cash App strategy to become 1 of the top providers of banking services. This quarter, my letter was focused on the Bitcoin strategy. If you haven't yet, please read that letter for details.
Before Amrita talks about our performance, there was a news report yesterday I wanted to address directly. In general, these sorts of stories can lack full context.
First, we do not believe that there are any new investigation in the Block, but rather that these reports relate to the existing inquiry by the DOJ that we've previously disclosed.
Second, there was critical information omitted from the article when it was first published. In 2022, our compliance engineering risk team, who proactively investigates threats, identified signals that lead us to conduct a thorough review of transactions potentially associated with sanctioned countries. We voluntarily reported these to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, where we were transparent with them, and we stand by the scope of the transactions that were included in the report. OFAC then issued us a No Action Letter in which they determine no further investigation or action was needed at the time. This is how the process is supposed to work and this outcome not originally included in the article.
Third, as it relates to preventing terrorist financing via Bitcoin, we have a robust control environment in place to mitigate exposure from adversaries. For instance, we use industry-leading blockchain analytics firms to screen transactions in real time. We also maintain some of the most restrictive limits in the industry for on-chain Bitcoin withdrawals, which are deliberately calibrated to prevent bad activity. And of course, we require identity verification for customers engaging with our Bitcoin products and file suspicious activity reports when warranted, which is an important contributor to keeping the broader financial ecosystem safe and secure.
We take compliance seriously at Block. Our culture of compliance is foundational to our work. We have a radically transparent culture that supports us. Employees are empowered to raise issues through multiple channels, including directly to me or anonymously through our whistleblower hotline. We continuously improve our compliance program based on the number of different inputs, including self-identified issues, audits and guidance from our regulators.
Adversaries have always and will continue to try to exploit the global financial system. No company is perfect at preventing this. Our work is to constantly be steps ahead of their attacks through better use of technology. This includes leveraging industry-leading machine learning models and product controls aimed at detecting and preventing bad activity in real time. It's an always-on part of our business, and it always will be.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amrita to talk about the quarter. Thanks, Jack. I'll keep my remarks brief as we've included information on our performance and guidance in the financial discussion of our shareholder letter.
We delivered strong results across the company during the first quarter. Gross profit was $2.09 billion, up 22% year-over-year, consistent with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $705 million, nearly doubling year-over-year. And adjusted operating income was $364 million, up 7x year-over-year.
By business, Cash App's gross profit was $1.26 billion, up 25% year-over-year. And Square's gross profit was $820 million, up 19% year-over-year. Gross profit outperformance compared to our guidance was mostly driven by Cash App.
We saw strength across Buy Now, Pay Later, Bitcoin, Cash App Borrow and Cash App Card, where we had 24 million monthly actives. Inflows per active were up 11% year-over-year in the quarter for our highest growth since the fourth quarter of 2021.
Square's GPV growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations as we saw continued moderation in same-store sales growth. This was more than offset by strong attach rates on our broader ecosystem of software and banking products.
Our profitability improved as we showed discipline across a range of expenses, ending the quarter below our 12,000-person cap and achieving leverage on corporate overhead expenses.
For the 12 months ending in March, adjusted free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up more than 2.5x compared to the prior 12 months, and represented 50% of adjusted EBITDA, an improvement compared to the 36% conversion rate in the prior period.
Turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year 2024 guidance for both gross profit and profitability, not only reflecting the Q1 outperformance but also reflecting our raised expectations for the remainder of the year.
For full year 2024, we are now expecting gross profit of at least $8.78 billion or 17% growth year-over-year. We expect Cash App's gross profit growth to moderate slightly from the first quarter's 25% as we lap some meaningful pricing and structural cost benefits, with relatively stable growth from the second quarter through fourth quarter.
For Square, we expect gross profit growth to moderate from the first quarter's 19% growth rate as we lap strong banking performance and pricing changes from the prior year. In the back half of the year, we expect GPV growth to be stable to improving behind more favorable same-store growth comparisons, with a narrowing delta between gross profit and GPV growth rates.
We continue to focus on initiatives that improve our product velocity. These include several upcoming launches that further our strategies for Cash App and Square, most notably testing and rolling out Afterpay on Cash App Card and for Square, completing the orders migration this summer and conversion to a single app by year-end. These initiatives remain on track, and we expect them to benefit our growth into 2025 and beyond.
For profitability in 2024, we are now expecting at least $1.3 billion in adjusted operating income or 15% margins on gross profit. With efficiency initiatives underway to improve our structural costs and corporate overhead, we also see opportunities to invest in the back half of the year in high-return areas like sales and marketing that can drive future growth.
Our updated guidance now implies a Rule of 32 for full year 2024. This is an improvement compared to 2023 and compared to our prior guidance of at least a Rule of 29 and progresses us towards our goal of achieving Rule of 40 in 2026.
With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang at JPMorgan. I wanted to, Jack, follow up on a question I asked you last quarter. I think you mentioned that you expect much higher or faster product velocity from Block across the board, so just wondering if you can give us a progress report on that. Are you close to where you want to be in launching and enhancing products? And I'm curious if some of the unannounced products that you're focused on are more about entering new categories is what I call it or are they more incremental to what you already have in place? I know a lot of investors have asked me about that, so I'll ask you. Yes. So we're focused on our development velocity in two main ways. One is making sure that we're much stronger in our engineering and design disciplines. We're putting much more focus on that work. This did a big change here with Square just recently, to reorganize the team, to be more focused on engineering and design. And we'll start seeing that play through more and more in our work.
And the second way we're doing is scoping, making sure that we're focused on the most important things. On the Square side, the most important thing that I want us to focus on right now is reliability, making sure that we stay up for sellers and that we have ways for them to work even if their networks fail, such as the off-line mode. The second most is what we've talked about in the past, the focus on local and food and beverage. And there's a number of things that we're doing immediately to help not only with retention but with acquisition. Amrita mentioned our single app, which is on track to launch this year, so that we have a very simple call to action. Download Square and you have everything you need, including all of our banking products within one app.
And then onboarding is another big one. We have successfully taken our onboarding flow for Square sellers from about 15 steps and something that took people close to 20 minutes to complete down to 2 steps and takes under 5 minutes. We rolled it out to a small audience and watched what they're doing. And we saw all positive results, some much more positive than we're expecting, so we're going to be rolling out that in the coming months. And that should have a pretty great effect on how we sign up new merchants. And most importantly, that they see more of our ecosystem and they want to stick around. And as we've talked about in the past, I think the best differentiator for us is the banking aspect of our ecosystem on the Square side.
To the second point of your question, I think both on Cash App and Square, there are new products, of course, but there's a lot of work to get to parity with some of our competitors. There's a lot of work to put some of the features that we've had into the hands of millions such as Afterpay on the Cash Card, which is going to continue to expand out this year and something we're super excited about. So a lot of work that is more iteration. And of course, we have some new products that we're thinking about as well. But the iteration stuff is really going to unlock a lot of new customers for us, we believe. And we will take our next question from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. I want to dig in a little bit on Cash App direct deposit net adds and the run rate that you might be seeing for new users. So last quarter, you mentioned that the addition of overdraft protection was helping to drive record gross adds for DD users. So I was wondering if the combination of that, plus high-yield savings and live phone support and maybe some other features, have really helped to maybe step up that run rate. So part of it is where is the run rate gone to today? And then the second part is, if it could potentially step up further with the addition of maybe some newer products around Billpay or, as you mentioned, Afterpay being worked into the cash card or cash card BNPL as we call it. Tim, thanks for the question. Our top strategic priority, as you know, for Cash App is banking our base, which is about bringing more financial services to our 57 million monthly actives. Banking is not a new concept for us, but it is one that we started prioritizing in a more meaningful way recently. The last few years, we've been seeing organic adoption of direct deposit. Now we're focusing our efforts on driving this higher and winning that longer-term relationship with our customers.
What we saw in March was that paycheck deposit actives grew on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with paycheck volumes growing faster than overall inflows. And as we think about continued growth here, there's two key areas of focus: one, around the product; and second, around how we go to market with those products.
From a product perspective, we're not only prioritizing table stakes features but also how we can make those offerings more compelling than what you can get at a bank. We're hearing our customers say they want products that allow them to bank without any worries. That's paying with checks. That's Billpay. That's a web offering. And we're hearing from our customers that they want to achieve their financial goals. That's initiatives around card spending insights, around our savings initiative, around Afterpay on Cash App Card.
From a go-to-market perspective, with all of these products, and as we bring them together, we'll be looking to package these products in a way that makes it easier for customers to discover and understand our offerings through the app. Again, that's bundling that's packaging. And then it's testing incentives and other ways to drive conversion. We haven't done much of that yet in terms of our go-to-market efforts with direct deposit. But you'll see us do much more of this as the features come together in the back half of this year and into next year.
Similar to what we've seen with Cash App Card or with Cash App Borrow, it takes time. It takes some time, several years, to get these to scale to where they are today. And we think similarly with bank or base and direct deposit, it's a multiyear effort, but it's one that we have deep conviction on and are very excited about. We will take our next question from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. It's great to see the ongoing improvement in EBITDA and the guide you guys gave now, a more notable increase than we expected so far, while at the same time, balancing it, with growth being strong. So I guess in that context, if you can just give us a little more color on what you're identifying in terms of efficiencies now that it was able to drive that uptick? And maybe what's on the horizon? What else do you see in the model that can drive further progress on efficiencies for EBITDA going forward? Darrin, thanks for the question. I'll start with the first quarter and then talk about what we're looking out for the full year. Obviously, what you saw, the first quarter was our highest-profitability metrics ever and a beat at the high end of our guidance of about $119 million from an adjusted OI perspective, with again, nearly doubling in terms of EBITDA on a year-over-year basis.
I think there's kind of three key things to point out. Obviously, there's continued strong growth and momentum across each of the two ecosystems, Square and Cash App, with 19% growth and 25% growth, respectively. But from an expense discipline perspective, three key things I'd call out.
First is our personnel cap, which is driving the right level of sharpening our strategy and prioritization and scoping our work, as Jack mentioned, and we remained under our 12,000-person cap at the end of the first quarter. Second, it's driving leverage across each of our areas of corporate overhead, whether it's T&E or professional fees, real estate, software and data fees. And third, it's around our structural costs and continuing to focus on ways that we can improve there. And do want to note, as we've called out in our shareholder letter, in the first quarter, we also benefited from $52 million in out-of-period items in Q1, mostly related to the releases of risk-loss provisions established in prior periods. So that's an important thing to note for the first quarter.
More broadly, when we look at the full year, from a profitability perspective, we've raised our profitability expectations both in EBITDA and adjusted OI basis not only for the full amount of outperformance relative to the high end of our guidance for Q1 but also an improved expectation for the remainder of the year where we expect to keep screws tight in terms of discipline and efficiency in how we run our business, but where we also see the flow-through of strong incremental margins in each of our businesses as we continue to grow Square and Cash App strongly for the remainder of the year, but also leaving room for us to invest in growth initiatives in the back half of the year. That should benefit our future growth, particularly around sales and marketing. So those are the different levers that we're looking at and why we think we can drive continued profitability through the remainder of the year. And we will take our next question from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Amrita, can you elaborate on the drivers and quarterly cadence of the gross profit growth of 17%? You gave some first half, second half color earlier, but just maybe talk a little bit more there and also about the assumptions for Cash App and Square. And then also, just as a follow-up, Borrow and Square Loans scaled nicely over the past year and year or so. What determines your ability and willingness to continue to grow this revenue stream as credit is less benign? Sure. So let me start on our gross profit growth assumptions for the remainder of the year. So obviously, we've raised our full year guidance on both gross profit and profitability. We now expect gross profit of $8.78 billion, at least $8.78 billion for the full year, that equates to about 17% growth year-over-year. That reflects both the outperformance during the first quarter mostly from Cash App with a modest beat from Square as well as improved expectations for the remainder of the year.
If you look at sort of breaking that down into its component parts, we expect Cash App will grow slightly faster than Square this year. We are going to be lapping some of the structural cost improvements in the back half of the year. And our implied guidance for the second half demonstrates, at a Block level, mid-teens gross profit growth expectation with these changes around structural cost and pricing mostly behind us.
Many of the key growth initiatives and strategies that we're hard at work at now and plan to be ramping through the back half of this year, whether it's Afterpay on Cash App Card, orders migration or the single app model, we expect to benefit our growth into 2025 and are less of a 2024 impact. That's sort of the cadence and the puts and takes around the remainder of the year.
I think the second question that you asked was around Borrow. We have seen strong growth on Borrow in the first quarter, with originations up more than 2x year-over-year. This is while we've been able to scale this product responsibly, with loss rates in line with what we've shared historically. This is growth that's primarily driven by increasing the number of loan actives while maintaining strict eligibility requirements.
And not only does Borrow have strong positive unit economics on its own, net of risk loss as a stand-alone product, but it drives a really compelling ecosystem benefit through greater inflows into Cash App that are then spent or invested across a number of different monetized products. In fact, we see nearly 40% of Borrow monthly actives making a transaction on Cash App Card after receiving a Borrow loan. And we've seen strong conversion rates from those offered loans and repeat usage.
Similar to what we see on a Square Loans product or a Buy Now, Pay Later product, we see that these products are very short in duration and act as sort of cash flow management or working capital products. So similarly with Borrow, we see repeat usage across Borrow monthly actives. And it's an area that we feel very strong about our machine learning and risk-loss capabilities behind the growth of this product, and so we're excited to continue to keep ramping it for our customers. We will take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. I wanted to ask about the integration of Afterpay and Buy No, Pay Later with the Cash App Card. How should we think about sizing the opportunity? In other words, which cash card customers or how many card customers would be eligible to use the Buy Now, Pay Later capability? And also, do you have any preliminary view of what the product might look like? Will users be able to toggle between credit and debit in the app, for example? Are there any other integrations like that, that you could share with us? Yes. I mean so we're really excited about this integration. Just some context for you, we acquired Afterpay some time ago, and I would say that we forced an integration way too quickly. And now having a fixed a bunch of those issues, the team is really executing on two main things. One is discovery. And that is within the Cash App, bringing our Cash App network and bring the Square merchant network together. So a lot of visibility around local and a lot of what we hope to achieve with the power of our combined ecosystems, both on the merchant and the seller side.
On the other side of that is the Cash App Card and how large that is and Cash App Pay, how large that network is growing to, and putting Afterpay on top of that as well. Afterpay on the Cash App Card, as I said earlier, is super exciting. We have started rolling it out. As with any product, we're looking at how people are using it, and we'll be making decisions on what it ultimately looks like when we roll it out 100% over time based on how people perceive it, how they use it, how they find it valuable or not valuable. But we think it's really exciting. And it's taking us some tend to get here, but we're finally here, so excited to see it roll out and for you all to be able to use it. And I'll just add a couple of points of data around that, Ramsey. First, with the opportunity that we've got, with bringing Afterpay to Cash App card, this is having an already built-in audience of 24 million monthly actives who have spent more than $100 billion in total over the past year. Of course, we're going to start small and, as with any lending sort of product, start small and ramp based on the signals that we see, Where eligible actives will be able to easily convert certain purchases into an Afterpay transaction. As Jack said, we've begun testing here already. We've seen strong attach rates and we're excited to scale this in the coming months. This brings visibility and the utility of Afterpay into Cash App much more directly than we've done so far and drive engagement around Buy Now, Pay Later which, on its own, is growing nicely for us: 25% GMV growth, 32% gross profit growth in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. And it helps merchant partners who have access now to a much bigger network of customers across the Cash App ecosystem.
Just the second piece, as Jack mentioned, Cash App Pay. The strength in the growth of Cash App Pay wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the enterprise sales team that Afterpay has built through the years, driving it across its network of merchants. And now Cash App Pay is an example of a payment tool that customers can use regularly, and so we're giving customers the Cash App more and more ways that they can spend their funds and more reasons to inflow funds into Cash App.
We ended the quarter, March had 4 million monthly actives across Cash App Pay, adding $1 million monthly active each of the last 3 quarters, while GMV was up 40%, more than 40%, quarter-over-quarter. So a very strong growth here, and I think more milestones towards proving out the integration between Cash App and Afterpay. We will take our next question from Trevor Williams with Jefferies. I wanted to dig into seller GPV. The card-not-present in retail growth rates, those have lagged overall GPV growth pretty consistently over the last few quarters, if you could just unpack what some of the dynamics have been within both of those. And then Amrita, on your comment that GPV growth could potentially accelerate in the second half, how much of that is comp-driven versus potentially starting to see some benefit from some of the go-to-market changes you guys have made? Yes. I mean just to very directly answer the end of your question, I think most of it's likely more comp-driven in terms of more favorable comp, but we've got a tremendous amount of work underway that we hope will shift the tide on Square GPV into 2025. Now just to back up, Square GPV in the first quarter was up 9% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations that we shared on the Q4 call. Again, gross profit growth, ahead of that based on the strength of our banking products and our SaaS attached products. U.S. growth was 6% in the quarter, while non-U.S. growth was 23% or 26% at constant currency. And as you noted, we expect, as we look ahead, to see stable to slightly improving GPV growth in the back half of the year.
But we're not satisfied with these growth rates, and we want to turn the tide. We think that increasing product velocity, as Jack shared earlier, and some of our go-to-market changes can improve growth in 2025. Specifically, I would point to orders migration, which helps us with critical features for food and beverage sellers and beauty in salons, like pre-authorization at bars or deposits for service and sellers. That work, as I mentioned earlier, is on track to be completed this summer; or onboarding flows where we're reducing the friction for new sellers to join the Square ecosystem from 10-plus minutes to a much more faster and intuitive onboarding experience. We began testing that new onboarding flow with quick-service restaurant sellers. And as Jack noted, those results are encouraging, so we'll be rolling it out to our other verticals in July.
And then contracts. As we think about our go-to-market motion, our sales team and the tools that we give them are critical to be able to reach the sellers with more complex needs. And we rolled out contracts in the second half of '23. And what we saw from December to March was that the number of U.S. sales wins that had contracts attached more than doubled. It's early, but we're also seeing cohort retention improvement when contracts are deployed. So we believe that there's more that we can do here as these products and features come together to lean in to go to market, especially in the back half of the year and into the future to improve the trend lines that we see across GPV. We will take our next question from Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. I just wanted to expand on what you just said there around the go-to-market strategies and the improved product velocity. And maybe if you could help us understand what the value proposition of contracts really unlocks for you guys. And maybe if we can just layer that into some of the expanded franchise capabilities that you discussed. I mean, the Bitkey is better, like that's a win for Square that we haven't seen that magnitude in the past. Yes. Well, just to start on contracts, since you pointed it out, this is something we were against for many years in our funding because we saw what a lot of people were doing to small merchants. They're locking them into these pretty predatory contracts. And we still see some of our peers do this today. We took a slightly different tact on it and also have a different goal. We recognize that there are merchants who appreciate contracts because it helps them with predictability of their cost and it allows us to get them free hardware. So if you were to look at just one point, it would be that. And from December to March, we saw the number of U.S. sales wins with contracts attached more than double.
So this is really still early for us, but we're looking, we're observing what our peers are doing. We're observing customer needs, and we want to do something that is far more attractive and much better for the seller and therefore, for us. And it's working. A big portion of what we're doing on the go-to-market side is we're just experimenting a lot more. I think in the past, we relied a little bit too much on one thing working. And when that thing didn't work, we switched the thing.
Now we are focused on a big thing in our go-to-market, which is like really looking deeply at the product and the onboarding experience, of course, and just really focusing a lot on that, but also looking at doing experiments like field sales, like contracts, everything we've done around verticalization of our sales force. All these things compound. And some of them will work, some of them won't work, and we'll invest heavily in the ones that do. But I think that experimentation mindset and being much faster to recognize when something is working or not working will help us really improve it, mirrored with everything that we're doing on the product side as well.
On the franchise capabilities, yes, this is an opportunity for us. We are focused a lot on food and beverage. We know there's a number of gaps that our competitors take advantage of. We're driving those home and fixing all of them. And our first goal is to get to parity on all the features that make us lose in food and beverage. And then as we get to that this year, then it's a question of really showing people the depth and the breadth of our ecosystem. And this is where banking continues to be a stronghold for us and something that will really set us apart, in addition to our renewed focus on a better design product and a better engineered product that doesn't fail. And we will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. I wanted to stay here on the Square side for a minute. You had expected the gross profit growth to decelerate in Q1. It's obviously accelerated modestly. And I think you said, at a high level, software and banking, obviously, were drivers there. But hoping you could go a little bit deeper into which specific parts of the software and the banking businesses and maybe touch on international a little bit also, just trying to unpack where the sources of upside surprise were because certainly good numbers to see there. Sure. Maybe just to unpack the drivers on the banking side first. What we saw was first quarter banking gross profit for Square grew 36% year-over-year and was the key driver of delta between gross profit and GPV growth. Unpacking that a bit more, what we saw was healthy repayment trends and strong organic volume growth drive results this quarter for banking. Square Loans facilitated $1.32 billion in originations, up 17% year-over-year in the first quarter. Instant transfer also contributed as we lap now, in the second quarter, some of the pricing impacts, pricing increases, that we made in Q2 of last year. And then gross profit from banking products in our international markets also continue to grow as we add more and more capabilities to more geographies.
The recent launches of loans in Japan in January, for instance, has well exceeded our initial expectations. Clearly, quick access to funds and a seamless product experience are true differentiators relative to existing financing options for SMBs in Japan. From an international perspective, in the first quarter, gross profit markets outside the U.S. grew 38% year-over-year and represented 13% of Square's gross profit. International GPV was up 23%.
We believe there is a significant long runway ahead for growth here as we're less than 1% penetrated in markets outside the U.S. And we've continued to see growth in our deeper vertical points of sale as well across the Square ecosystem. So each of the key strategic and focus areas for us continues to show outsized growth and will be areas that we lean into. Specifically on vertical points of sale, gross profit from products across retail restaurants and appointments grew 24% year-over-year in the first quarter. We will take our next question from Alex Markgraff with KBCM. Just a couple on tax in direct deposit. Of the 40% tax actives, the positive refunds into cash, just curious what sort of overlap there might be with existing payroll direct deposit actives? And then what exactly is entailed in sort of converting those folks that are not maybe overlapping today? And then just as a quick follow-up, any sort of indication of inflows growth excluding the impact of any sort of tax refund growth. So as I noted, the paycheck direct deposit inflows grew faster than overall inflows, so that is neutralized for the tax impact in Q1, the sort of seasonal impact in Q1. More broadly, what I'd say about our tax initiative is that it represents a discovery initiative for us in bringing our direct deposit capabilities, the ability to get your funds faster through Cash App, and put it front and center for our customers as they're engaging in a deep financial services offering that we have a free one with taxes. And so as you look at the broader base of direct deposits in Q1, that's clearly larger than the paycheck direct deposits alone. And we saw growth in that as well.
But really, the tax piece is about driving discovery and awareness around our broader financial services offering, including paycheck direct deposits. And it is a potential for us to convert more of those tax direct deposit customers in the paycheck direct deposit customers. A much broader opportunity for us, of course, is, as I mentioned earlier, around the key initiatives that we got from a product perspective around financial services and around bringing all of those initiatives together in bundling and in pricing that's compelling to our customers. And we will take our next question from John Davis with Raymond James. Jack, I just wanted to touch on the recent merchant settlement with the networks, both on the surcharging side as well as the interchange cuts, and just thoughts on how that impacts the merchants and Square more specifically. Sorry, what are you talking about here? Sorry, the merchant settlement with Visa and Mastercard on the ability to surcharge as well as the cut in interchange going into effect next year. I'm not sure how to answer the question. I haven't spent much time on this particular issue. I do know that it is an active conversation for a lot of sellers and their customers, and different countries have different policies on this. We don't have a surcharge ability on Square right now. We are rolling that out in Australia where it is something that most merchants do. But no other comment on this. Okay. Then maybe just Amrita, just a quick question on the sustainability of the 1,000 basis point difference and kind of GPV growth in Square of 9% versus 19%. I know you noted Square banking growth was like mid-30s for the quarter. But how should we think about the relation between GPV growth and seller and GP growth throughout the balance of the year? Yes. As I noted in the interim remarks, what we expect to see is a narrowing of the gap or the delta between gross profit growth and GPV growth. That's as we see GPV growth in the back half of the year, we expect to be stable to improving behind more favorable same-store comparisons. So that's sort of the expectation that we see for the remainder of the year. And we expect gross profit growth to moderate a bit from the first quarter, 19%, as we lap some of that stronger banking performance and pricing changes from the prior year.
Obviously, all of our key initiatives the Jack's been referencing related to Square. From a product and go-to-market perspective, we're hard at work on and believe that, as they hit throughout the remainder of the year, can turn the tide from the 2025 perspective. And we will now take our final question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Congrats on the solid results here. I just want to ask about Afterpay. It really seemed to have turned a corner, with volume now having consistently growing 25% the last couple of quarters. Can you just maybe talk high level what's changed for Afterpay to get better growth? And then obviously, the gross profit growth jumped this quarter to be higher than the volume. Maybe what are those drivers and the outlook there? Sure. I can start on this, which is we saw strong growth in the quarter, as you noted, both from a GMV perspective, and even more so from a gross profit perspective, GMV being similar to our Q4 growth rate at 25% but with gross profit at 32%, which is higher than the fourth quarter growth rate. What we saw with Afterpay was strong customer acquisition across both consumers and merchants with growth driven by single-use payments and our gift cards offering. Single-use payments is our product that allows customers across the U.K., U.S. and Australia to shop via the Afterpay app and merchants that aren't in Afterpay's network, so a broad set of merchants. And that enables us to reach highly engaged customers through personalized merchant recommendations in the app while also offering a flexible payment offering.
And gift card is a product that allows eligible customers to purchase an online gift card from a variety of leading retailers and then spread it out across 4 payments with Afterpay. Afterpay's enterprise sales team also has been driving a strong pipeline of new merchant growth across all of these products, our core Buy Now, Pay Later products as well as some of these newer products. Some of these newer products also do have improved monetization rate relative to Buy Now, Pay Later. And that, I think, is some of what you're seeing come through in terms of the stronger gross profit growth.
Stepping back more broadly to the first part of your question, what's changed here is, as Jack noted, we've reset on our strategy and reorganized our team. Afterpay is now fully embedded in the Cash App ecosystem and operating at a high level of excellence between our sales team, our product-led teams and our customer-facing teams. And so we're excited to see what's ahead not only for some of the stand-alone Afterpay initiatives but also the deeper integrations that we're doing with Afterpay on Cash App Card and with Cash App Pay, which has now strong growth, of which I think is very much attributable to the Afterpay team as well. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude our program, and you may all now disconnect.",we will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions . we would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call . all statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward looking .,1.0

Today's call will be 45 minutes. And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.
We will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During Q&A, we will take questions from conference call participants. We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed to be forward-looking.
These forward-looking statements include discussions of our outlook, strategy and guidance as well as our long-term targets and goals. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ.

We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further discussion during this call of Cash App's banking services refer to those offered through our bank partners.
Within these remarks, we will also discuss metrics related to our investment framework, including Rule of 40. With Rule of 40, we are evaluating the sum of our gross profit growth and adjusted operating income margin. Also, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the shareholder letter and our historical financial information spreadsheet on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly.
With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack. Thank you all for joining us. I focused my shareholder letter this quarter on our go-to-market strategy for Square and our efforts to improve acquisition across sales, partnerships, marketing and product. If you haven't yet, please read that letter for details. As part of this, I'm thrilled to share that Nick Molnar, the CEO and Co-Founder of Afterpay, will be leading a centralized sales function across Block working across Square, Cash App and Afterpay. Nick shaped Afterpay's high-performing sales culture and we're excited for him to raise the bar for Square and across Block.
This aligns with our recent decision to reorganize our company's reporting structure by function, enabling more collaboration across our different ecosystems. This will also help our people get to true mastery of their craft and open up opportunities for mobility within disciplines. We plan to execute this change this month with minimal disruption. The new reporting structure does not impact our strategy, road maps or financial goals. Instead, we believe it will allow us to move with greater speed, agility and efficiency on the growth initiatives we've already discussed. Similar to prior quarters, we're going to keep our remarks brief to focus on your questions. And with that, I'll turn it over to Amrita. Thanks, Jack. We've delivered strong results across the company during the second quarter. Gross profit was $2.23 billion, up 20% year-over-year. By business, Square gross profit was $923 million, up 15% year-over-year, and Cash App gross profit was $1.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Both businesses showed strength in areas aligned to our strategies. Gross profit outperformance compared to our guidance was mostly driven by Cash App. We saw strength across Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow and buy now pay later. Inflows per active saw healthy growth, up 10% year-over-year in the quarter and was consistent quarter-over-quarter despite coming off the first quarter seasonal benefit of tax refunds. Square's gross profit was in line with our expectations, with strength in software and integrated payments and banking. GPV growth in the quarter was up 8% year-over-year, as strength from our markets outside the U.S. was offset by a continued moderation in U.S. same-store sales growth, consistent with broader macro data points.
From a profitability perspective, we saw a significant increase on a year-over-year basis. with meaningful margin improvement due to our improved efficiency and discipline on expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $759 million, nearly doubling year-over-year and adjusted operating income was $399 million, up 16x year-over-year. For the 12 months ending in June, adjusted free cash flow was $1.43 billion, which was up more than 2x versus the prior 12 months and represented [ 57% ] of adjusted EBITDA, an improvement compared to the 44% conversion rate in the prior period. Our strong profitable growth shows that our ecosystems continue to serve our customers with differentiated value. And our teams are operating with purpose and efficiency.
As Jack noted, our shift to a functional organizational structure is about deepening collaboration across our ecosystem. It doesn't change is our commitment to our long-term target of achieving Rule of 40 in 2026 and our reporting of gross profit by business segment. We'll also continue to hold our leaders accountable to our existing product road map and go-to-market time lines.
Turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year 2024 guidance for both gross profit and profitability, reflecting not only outperformance in the second quarter, but also increased expectations for the remainder of the year. For full year 2024, we are now expecting gross profit of at least $8.89 billion or 18% growth year-over-year. This reflects our strong top line momentum as we head into the back half of the year. We expect Cash App to deliver strong gross profit growth in the back half of the year with growth expected to moderate only slightly from the second quarter's 23% even as we fully lap the benefit from improvements to our structural costs in the second half.
For Square, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth for the back half of the year to be relatively in line with the second quarter's growth rate. We remain focused on cross-selling banking and software further into our seller base and optimizing our processing value chain. In the back half of the year, we expect GPV growth to be relatively stable, although we are mindful of the backdrop for consumer discretionary spending continues to be dynamic. Our focus is on the things we can control, including executing against our product strategy and the go-to-market approach Jack outlined in his letter.
Over the past year, our discipline on operating expenses has driven significant operating leverage in our business. While we do not share segment adjusted operating income, we wanted to share a view of the business level profit margins we expect this year. For 2024, we expect each of Cash App and Square's adjusted operating income margins to be in the high teens range, delivering meaningful improvement in the underlying profitability of these businesses each of the last 2 years.
Across both ecosystems, our efforts are centered on initiatives that improve our product and go-to-market velocity and which we expect to benefit us into 2025. For Cash App, we continue to round out the features that support our bank to base strategy and are starting to increase marketing investment behind them. For Square, we're excited about our partnership strategy and planned product launches post completion of the orders migration work this summer. Sellers will start to see our single point-of-sale app before year-end, which will be a significant unlock for simplifying our value proposition.
From a profitability perspective, we are now expecting at least $1.44 billion in adjusted operating income in 2024 or 16% margins on gross profit with efficiency initiatives underway to improve our structural costs and corporate overhead. This also reflects plans for a step-up in sales and marketing in the back half for both Square and Cash App as we invest behind the strong unit economics and margins in each business to drive growth into 2025.
Our updated guidance now implies Rule of 35 for full year 2024, a significant improvement compared to 2023 and progressing towards our goal of achieving Rule of 40 in 2026. Finally, as our margins and free cash flow generation have improved, we also plan to return more capital to shareholders. We very recently completed our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And today, we're excited to announce an incremental $3 billion share repurchase program. With that, I'll now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
And your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. It takes a lot of great results here. I did -- I like the go-to-market discussion in the letter here, Jack, and definitely excited for Nick to lead sales. I want to ask you, Jack, just curious what inspired this shift to a functional work structure, why now, what outcomes do you -- or should we expect from the change in the short to midterm? Is it more collaborative products? Or is it just more products? And what are the risks because whenever I think about these kind of changes, I always worry about the risks, and I'm sure you have some guardrails in place. So anything you could share would be terrific. Yes. The short answer to the question is it will result in much better technology, much better design and ultimately a much better product. We -- I want us to be able to move much, much faster with newer technologies such as all of the AI models, all the open source AI models that you're seeing come to market really level the playing field for us and by seeing that technology through the lens of an engineering and design and product organized company versus trying to manage us across different business units.
It means we can move much better and much faster. We do have multiple business units right now. They represent multiple brands, lots more customers. Obviously, as we've been talking about for some time, we believe our superpower is combining these. And I believe strongly that this model will allow us a lot more flexibility and also the collaboration that you mentioned.
But the real benefit, I believe, is more of a focus on better technology and better design and better products through engineering, design and product being at the top of the company. And obviously, centralizing sales and really providing a tangible change and shift to how we think about Square's go-to-market completes a lot of the work we've been doing on the product side. So I'm really excited about that. In terms of risk, we've tried to mitigate a bunch of the risk by changing -- starting with only the reporting structure. So Block, before this move, every single business unit was functionally organized.
So what this is effectively doing is just removing that business unit lead structure, appointing a new functional lead and going. So most of the company will not notice a change at all. But it means that we can start really focusing on our disciplines and up-leveling and raising the bar on our talent and execution, again, from that technology and design lens. So I think we've mitigated the risk. We're not changing any of our goals. We're not changing assignments to products and projects that people have. Over time, as we build confidence around those things, we will evolve our operating model and just how we work together. But right now, this is just a reporting shift so we can really focus on our disciplines and improve them greatly, which will have all the desired outcomes that we want. So I think with this move, in particular, there's very little risk because we're holding ourselves accountable to the goals that we've put out before us. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. I really want to dig in on the U.S. GPV trends within seller. So two factors that have impacted growth in the recent past have been discretionary spend, which you called out earlier, particularly you called out earlier, the 2021 and '22 cohorts. And also, there's been the weakness in the NKE, which was in the shareholder letter.
But looking ahead, you have a combination of easing comps, you have the pre-auth and product work done. You have sales force hiring ahead, you mentioned a reinvestment in marketing, distribution partnerships. Granted, many of these factors are more 2025 or 2026 drivers, but with that in mind, maybe you could touch a little bit on or expand upon the second half GPV expectations and then somehow these initiatives would be more supportive for next year. Yes, I can start with this and then Amrita can follow up. I think we now have a perfect storm brewing for Square. We spent the past few months really focused on organizing the product priorities, simplifying our product approach, making sure that we have a much more cohesive and understandable and intuitive system. We're looking at every single aspect of our offering from onboarding and acquisition to our dashboard where sellers are introduced to new products to the products themselves, our hardware, how we think about marketing. Everything has been investigated and evolved including, as we've been talking about our orders migration, the platform, unlocking features that bring us to parity and beyond our competitors. And now that we are centralizing sales under Nick.
I feel like we have a tangible solution to that. So all the pieces are now set. I do think the majority of them come together at closer to the end of this year, so the end of summer to the end of the year and really manifest next year. And I think all these changes compound into something that I'm really excited about, a much better foundation for us and gives us an opportunity to truly compete with our peers in a way that we haven't for years. So I'm pretty confident about all the moves.
I think we've executed them in the right priority, like really focusing on onboarding and products, first and foremost, who we get that acquisition and retaining our sellers, making sure that we have a rock solid and reliable platform that offers all the features that we see with our peers and then improving our go-to-market, including newer initiatives like field sales that our peers have used quite effectively, but with a weaker product in my mind. So that we have the strength in all of those. I think we'll shake up for really, really good outcomes going forward. And Tim, I'll just add some color as well with respect to GPV trend lines that we're seeing. For the second quarter, GPV was up 8% year-over-year, which is a slight moderation from the 9% year-over-year growth rate that we saw in the first quarter. And as we look towards the back half of the year, we expect to see stability in that GPV growth rate compared to what we saw in the second quarter, as I noted earlier.
When you unpack some of what's going on there, it is very consistent trend lines with both what we've called out over the past couple of quarters as well as what we're seeing externally. We're seeing relatively consistent trends from a churn and customer acquisition standpoint with more of the moderation coming from same-store growth or GPV per seller, which continue to moderate a bit on a year-over-year basis. And we've seen many other companies note similar softness from a discretionary consumer spend perspective as we look at external data point showing a dynamic macro backdrop, whether it's slower new business formations or industry-specific data across the verticals that we serve.
Now with that backdrop, we have still been able to grow the Square business strongly from a gross profit perspective, a 15% growth in the second quarter and with outsized growth in the areas that we are really strategically inflecting whether it's a vertical points of sale, which grew 21% on a gross profit basis in the second quarter or our banking products, which grew 27% or international markets, which grew 34%. Each of those areas showing strong product market with those customers that we're serving. And so what we're focused on more than anything at this point, as Jack noted, is what we can control, which is improving GPV growth and ultimately, gross traffic growth by investing across partnerships ramping our marketing spend, simplifying our onboarding tools and launching new products. And your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Nice job. I want to touch on the incremental distribution partners you called out like U.S. Food and obviously, those are clear adds and material, could be material. I think you talked about 40% coverage of the restaurant space. If you could just expand on this a little bit more on what the potential is for it, how it could contribute to actual GPV potentially over time? How does this fit into the road map and time line and your strategy? And then maybe just any other types of partnerships we can expect on the horizon, whether it's domestic or internationally? It seems like a nice addition. Yes. So we've -- as I said, we've been reconsidering everything, including how we think about partnerships. We've got a lot of questions about this in the past. We're investing in 3 types of partners vertical in specific industries like food and beverage, horizontal that have more broad reach across geographies and business types and then looking at third-party sales organizations.
In terms of food, as we mentioned in a shareholder letter, we've made a lot of progress, especially around food and beverages, and we signed U.S. Foods and -- but that means we're serving our partners up to 40% of the restaurants in the United States, which is a pretty sizable chunk. And we have a strong pipeline of both vertical and horizontal partners in the U.S. International, we're doing a lot more, especially around bank partnerships. So outside of the U.S., the bank partnership, [indiscernible] is working quite well, and we're working to sign more. And also internationally, we're exploring third-party sales as well. Just a much easier approach than what we're currently seeing in the U.S. and where we think we're going to get the most impact in the United States. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Direct deposit has been a focus for the company for some time. I don't think I saw it in the letter, but I think we're still at a few million recurring paycheck direct depositors. One of your main competitors has, call it, 4 million to 5 million direct depositors. What's it going to take to push this number meaningfully higher? What's working? What's not working? And is there any way to think about the adoption curve around direct depositors and the visibility you have into that? Yes, I can start and Amrita can follow up. There's 3 main ways that we believe we will drive direct deposit, and this is all captured in our bank the-day strategy, which we referenced in earlier earnings letter. The first is packaging. The second is around marketing and the third is products. I'll start with packaging. We want to make sure that the benefits of depositing your paycheck is super clear in the app. So one of the things we're doing is those who deposit $300 each month get access to free overdraft coverage up to a certain amount of 4.5% savings yield priority phone support, which is really important and free in-network ATM withdrawals in addition to early access to the paycheck. So making sure that those incentives are clear. Marketing is another one. We're investing in the back half of the year as we've been further refining our strategy based on the impact that we're seeing. Again, like the incentives matter here. So we have deep expertise in peer-to-peer referrals and Cash App card with Boost. We're starting to test this past quarter and seeing some strong results around our marketing and just like marketing those incentives. And we're cross-selling direct deposit through in-app messages as well. And then finally, in products, we want to add spending insights to the Cash App Card, so customers can make more informed financial decisions, improving our web experience to look at balances and review statements.
That's what a lot of our customers expect from their bank, and they should expect it from cash up as well. And then integrating commerce by expanding buy now, pay later on the Cash App later this year. These are all ways that people can make their money work more for them and reasons why they just want to direct deposit their entire paycheck to cash up, they have much better utility. So that's how we think about driving it. And again, it all goes back to the bank to base strategy, and I'll let Amrita follow-up. Yes. Ken, I just add that we're really holding ourselves accountable to 2 metrics as we assess our performance against our bank to base strategy, which of course, is just about making Cash App our customers' primary financial tool. The near-term metric is inflows per active, the medium- to longer-term metric is around Paycheck deposit actives. So looking at each of those, with inflows per active, we've had strong momentum on engagement through the first half of this year in both the first quarter and second quarter, we saw double-digit growth in inflows per active behind strengthen our banking products, specifically with Cash App card and Cash App borrow. With card, we saw -- we've seen this product as oftentimes our customers' first entry point into banking with Cash App. And as utility grows, ultimately, we see a greater portion of inflows from those customers.
With Cash App borrow, this provides customers with access to small dollar credit, kind of like working capital, which is really key we've seen to winning that primary banking relationship. So continuing to drive engagement and adoption of these key financial services products is ultimately leading to stronger engagement and stronger inflows per active. On the second metric, Paycheck direct deposit active, this is a longer-term strategy, one that we've really clarified throughout the first part of this year, and as Jack noted, have already made a bunch of progress across packaging, marketing and product features, but that 2 million or so paycheck deposit actives was largely driven organically.
And that number has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year as we increased the penetration of -- into our Cash App card active base even through the second quarter. And as you heard from Jack, there's more to come, both from a product and go-to-market perspective that we think drives focus not only to our overall banking products, but also ultimately to the long-term goal of earning their paycheck. And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. So lots of balls in the air at Square. We've gone through a lot of it. And I'm curious, as you look ahead to 2025, which of these newer products and go-to-market initiatives are really best positioned ultimately to move the needle on GPV growth if you had to highlight maybe the top couple or so. Yes. I think the most important thing is our platform and making sure that we have something that's reliable. We did take a bunch of hits in the past when our service went down. So this is the #1 priority. We want to make sure that we are up for our sellers constantly, and we're not taking the time away from their business. That's not just about keeping our servers up. It's also providing features that allows them to work offline even when their WiFi is down. so they can still make the sale. Orders migration is something we've been talking about. This is migrating our system to a newer framework so that we can add features like pre-auth and deposits and other things. The kiosk that we just launched, the Square Kiosk is built on the same platform. So we do have this up and we will scale it to the rest of our futures by the end of this summer. So all that's on track. The pre-auth capabilities that are being tested today through [indiscernible] apps with select sellers, and all this means we can serve a wider range of sellers, more borrowers, full-service restaurants, service sellers and omnichannel retailers.
Onboarding has been a big focus for us. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, it took over 10 minutes in most cases, like 20 minutes and 30 steps just to sign up for Square. And we got that down to r and that means that people can see the dashboard right away, and they can see the full breadth of everything that we offer all of our products and they can start attaching to those products and turning them on.
But most importantly, they get a feel of what Square is and much easier to commit to it after you feel it. And the single app is one thing I'm really excited about. We have 4 or 5 apps in the App Store. We're going to bring that down to one. That really eases our go-to-market because all we have to say is download Square in the App Store, Google Play and the Apple customize itself based on your preferences and based on how you use it and based on your role at the particular business that you're in.
So we're using much better technology to personalize our experiences on the apps and through our hardware and through the dashboard itself. So as I said before, I think we're -- we have a perfect storm. We've been focusing on product and acquisition and retaining folks. We have a much stronger answer as we centralize sales across the entire company. And we have one go-to-market strategy with a leader who's done some amazing things on the Afterpay side. And all these things will compound into a lot of the outcomes that we've been wanting to see for some time and I think put us in a lead against a lot of our peers. And your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Jack and Amrita, I wanted to follow-up on some of your responses around the orders migration and replatforming project. Could you help us think through the incremental sort of market opportunity that it opens for you guys? And maybe also comment on the sales strategy to sell in the new capabilities? Will you be leveraging inside sales or cross-sell or -- how do you kind of proactively get that to market expeditiously. I can kick off -- go ahead, Jack. I can start on this. I think the most important thing about the orders migration is that we have a much more flexible and reliable platform with which to build on top and it does unlock a bunch of features that bring us to parity and beyond with our peers, especially in food and beverage. So as I said before, stuff like pre-auth and bar tabs and there's a whole host of features that have been blocked on this work. But ultimately, it's not just about those particular features. It's about a much greater development velocity because we have a much more stable, much more cohesive and much more enabling platform that allows us to really move a lot faster, but also build better products. Product has always been our strength. And I would state that our product is far above the majority product quality is far above the majority of our competitors.
Where we have been weaker in the past is how we mirror that with our go-to-market strategy and just updating our approach there, especially given what our competitors have done. Acquisition has been tough because we just put away too many steps in front of sellers. So all of these are either launched or about to be launched. And that gets us back to a Square that I think becomes a leader for sellers again in a way that we haven't seen in quite some time. Yes, Ramsey, I can add just a bit of color maybe to help bring it to life a little bit, what the -- how important the orders migration is for us. ultimately, the orders migration moves us from a payment-oriented platform towards a sales-oriented platform. Almost all of our products assume a single payment was at the heart of a sale. But as we know, commerce has grown far more complex than that.
Just to give you a couple of examples, if you order online and pick up in store, the order and the payment might be separate events. If you go to a full service restaurant and place an order, the order and payment, again, may be separate events. If a customer buys 5 items from an e-commerce seller, and wants to return two, you need to have separate logic for the cart between the order and the payment for each item.
Final example, if you're a services seller that needs a deposit before starting a project. that project or order is the core of your business and enables -- once we shift to the orders migration, enable multiple payments for that project. So what it enables our sellers to do is be able to sell more anywhere, anyhow, more flexibly, help them run more efficiently, give them time back and empower them with the data to better serve their customers. It unlocked just most recently, our kiosk product launch, which is something that we know is really important again for the food and beverage space where sellers want to sell via kiosk, drive-throughs, other forms of checkout, need to open an order, which exists throughout the sale and in many cases exist long after the buyer has consumed the goods or services. So those are just some examples of the sorts of things across really all verticals, food and beverage services, retail, that our orders migration help unlock. And your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Can you give us some more color -- some color on the core scientific deal? How do you think about the opportunity within Bitcoin [indiscernible] in house? Yes, happy to. This is -- I think this is a massive opportunity for us. This is a super concentrated industry with one main provider and that is a bit more [indiscernible]. We spent a lot of time talking to Bitmains customers. All the feedback was extremely consistent. The #1 concern is reliability. Bitmain produces mining chips and rigs that fail a lot. The second was around being able to customize into minor particular solutions. This is why we decided to make the chip and also build this in the open source -- in an open source way so that our customers can actually design their systems around any part of our system that they wish or can buy a full mining rig from us. And then second -- sorry, third is being just a lot more transparent around pricing.
And all 3 of those things are what matter most to miners and our customers. In addition, we're one of the few companies in the world that have access to a 3-nanometer fab. Bitmain is producing chips that are 6 nanometer. So we can build a far better product that's far more reliable, far more open and configurable and this is super attractive to every single mine that we've talked to, and you're seeing the result of that within one of the deals we just announced, and we have a very strong pipeline behind it as well.
So I'm fully confident and have no doubt that this is going to be a significant business for us, and we're going to take a majority of the market share. And your next question comes from the line of Lafitani Sotero with MSP. Great to see the up to $3 billion reloaded the share repurchase program. Can you talk to the capital intensity of Cash App and Square, and is it changing as the product mix shifts. Thanks for the question. So first, just with respect to capital allocation, to provide context level set as we progress towards being a Rule of 40 company, we expect both our margin profile to improve as well as our free cash flow generation. And what we expect to do with -- as you see here with our $3 billion share repurchase authorization, as a continuation of our initial $1 billion share repurchase authorization last year is to return capital to shareholders in excess of what we need to run our business.
What we need to run our business, which I think is sort of the core to your question, this is obviously to support our operating expenses, where you've seen a tremendous amount of leverage from us over the past year or two across personnel, across corporate overhead expenses, across our structural unit economics in each of our businesses. And we expect to continue that work. As you see reflected in our raised profitability guide that not only reflects the strong second quarter, but also our improved expectations for the back half of the year. So we continue on that journey of driving efficiency and discipline in our operating expenses. The second piece of, obviously, what our balance sheet covers from a business operation standpoint is some of the lending originations related to our core lending products, which include, obviously, Square loans, where we sell the vast majority of those loans off to investors, our Afterpay buy now, pay later product and our Cash App borrow product.
Both of those 2 products are typically very small in size, $100 to $200 type loans on average and turned 15x the year with a very simplified repayment mechanism. So given the short duration given the small size, they really act like working capital for our customers, and we can efficiently turn $1 on our balance sheet to support to support the growth of each of those -- the strong growth that we're seeing in each of those businesses.
We also, as we think longer term, have optionality around our funding structures. As we've done with Square loans, we have the potential to expand upon our investor base that we could potentially bring buy now, Pay later and borrow to over the medium to long term. And really, our focus is on the very strong unit economics and risk return profiles that we've seen with both of these products to continue to make that case to investors over the long term. So can I summarize the capital intensity is broadly the same and that we should expect to see ongoing share repurchase programs over time as the profitability improves as you move to Rule of 40. Yes. Our capital allocation program is, as I said, first and foremost, support the organic growth of the business and to ensure that we can also support a diverse balance sheet, including some of these lending originations, some which we may sell off and then to return excess capital to shareholders. And that's what you see today with the $3 billion purchase authorization. And your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Great results. I wanted to ask about Cash App Pay. It looks like it continues to grow I think you mentioned volumes up 7x year-over-year, 18% quarter-over-quarter. This seems like a huge opportunity. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the drivers and what to expect in the coming 6 to 12 months from that. Yes. Yes, you're right. The [indiscernible] was up more than 7x compared to the prior year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. What's driving the growth is our sales team, Afterpay's enterprise sales team. As of June, Cash App Pay actives are more than 80% of the scale of Afterpay U.S. actives compared to less than 25% a year ago. We're signing many large merchants. This past quarter, we added Google Play, which is a top merchant for Cash App Pay. And we're finding that merchants value Cash App Pay because they can access all Cash App customers. Our cash-paid actives are highly engaged, and we offer competitive pricing. So the formula is working and the sales team is doing an amazing job, and we'll continue to grow. And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Can you help us understand the pricing opportunities inside of the Square seller, especially with some of the product acceleration refreshes thinking just about pricing higher for value versus some of the pricing transparency and potentially coming in at a lower cost of ownership that you mentioned in the shareholder letter for some of the incumbents and digital peers. Yes. I think at a very high level, we have a lot of opportunity here. We're seeing a lot of our peers and competitors raise their pricing and that doesn't necessarily come with a raise in quality or more products or more features. So we've been spending a lot of time on our quality and our products and features. We've also been looking at simplifying how we approach pricing and how it's presented to our customers. We're right in the midst of doing a bunch of those reviews and looking at the numbers and how those might work. I do think like we can have a better packaging and better bundling of our products, and we're doing that work right now.
And I'm pretty excited about starting to test these things, and that will be something that we will do definitely this year. But I think we have an amazing opportunity just given what our peers are doing as well and how we're seeing them raise our pricing and opportunity for us to take a larger portion of the network and not have our pricing be an excuse, we can take that off the table. But I think the majority of it is going to come from really looking at simplifying and and getting people in as soon as possible so they can see the full extent of our ecosystem and the value that it brings with a much simpler pricing going forward. And we will now take our last question from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. I appreciate you squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask a question on the Cash App monthly active this quarter. I think there was a comment in the shareholder letter about some enhancements made to promote a healthier ecosystem as well as a strategic pullback in marketing spend. So maybe you could kind of elaborate on what's driving those and maybe specifically on some of the enhancements that you made. I appreciate it. Sure. Thanks, Will. So in June, we ended the quarter with $57 million monthly actives in Cash App, which was a growth of 5% year-over-year, similar to the growth rate that we saw earlier in the year as well. We see a really compelling opportunity here to drive active growth for consumers in the U.S. with less than $150,000 in household income. That represents 80% in the U.S. today. And so there's significant opportunity to continue to gain market share.
Some of the enhancements that we called out specifically in the shareholder letter are really to drive our continued focus on promoting a healthy ecosystem. So it includes changes to the onboarding flow, which can, among other things, give us a better understanding of our customers, enable access to more products and higher limit for those customers and also helps create opportunities for cross-selling. We're continuing to see strong engagement as we make some of these changes. We really have focused on driving deeper engagement across our financial services and commerce products for our customers. And you see that evidenced by the strong growth of the inflows per active, which grew, as I noted earlier, 10% year-over-year.
From a marketing perspective, we've been fairly disciplined in marketing as we refined our bank to base strategy in the first half of the year, and we're now ready and planning to ramp spend in the back half of the year on various campaigns. And you heard about some of those earlier, as we talked about our bank to base strategy or engaging our customers and our banking products and ultimately earning their paycheck. As we think about the opportunity ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue to grow across our base of potential customers in the United States. We know Cash App resonates strongly with Gen Z and millennials. Those customers, those demographics make up nearly 3/4 of our active base. And we think there's plenty of room to grow because we estimate we're only 34% penetrated in the Gen Z segment and 25% penetrated in the millennial segment. So as we look at the long term, we see an opportunity to continue to grow our active potential base of customers for Cash App. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude the program, and you may now all disconnect.",we will begin this call with some short remarks before opening the call directly to your questions . all statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-looking . this call is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website .,0.0
