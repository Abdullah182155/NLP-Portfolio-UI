For the first time, gross margins strongly exceeded 60%, non-GAAP operating margins exceeded 40% and net income exceeded $1 billion.
Fiscal 2018 revenue was $9.71 billion, up 41% or $2.8 billion above the previous year. These short platforms posted record full year revenue with data center growing triple digit. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 33% from last year to 2.46 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 75% to $450 million.
Let’s start with our Gaming business. Q4 revenue was $1.74 billion, up 29% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially with growth across all regions, driving GPU demand for a number of great titles during the holiday season, including Players Battleground, PUBG, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2. PUBG continued its remarkable run reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players.
These games delivered stunning, visible effects that requires strong graphics performance, which is driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture. eSports continues to grow, expanding the overall industry and our business. And one sign of their popularity Activision Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week.
We had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the Annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs, Big Format Gaming Displays in a partnership with ACER, ASUS and HP. The high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and interrogate our shield streaming devices, offering popular apps such Netflix, Gaming Video, YouTube and Hulu, the BFGD 19 best of show awards from various publications.
We expanded the free beta of GeForce now beyond Macs to Window based PCs and we enhanced GeForce's experience with new features, including NVIDIA Freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters and updated NVIDIA Ansel photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay Highlights for capturing gaming achievements.
Additionally, the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth, as it became the fastest selling console of all time in the U.S. Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and some was not with our gaming GPUs.
This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter. While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile.
Moving to data center, revenue of $606 million was up 105% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture, which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4. V100 are available through every major computer maker and have been chosen by every major cloud provider to deliver AI and high performance computing.
Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and Samsung. We continued our leadership in AI training markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training, learning networks.
During the quarter, Japan's preferred networks trends ResNet-503 network for image classification in a record of 15 minute by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs. Our newer generation V100 delivered even higher performance with the Volta architecture offering 10 times the deep learning performance of Pascal.
We also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA's platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs. We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs. Hyperscale inference applications that runs on GPUs includes speech recognition, image and video analytics, recommender system, translations, search and a natural language processing.
The data center business also benefited from strong growth and high performance computing. The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore’s law has begun to level off indeed more than 500 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated including all of the top 15.
NVIDIA added a record 34 new GPU accelerated system to the latest top 500 supercomputer lift, bringing our total to 87 systems. We increased our total petaflops of list by 28% and we captured 14 of the top 20 slots on the Green500 list of the world’s most energy efficient supercomputers.
During the quarter, we continue to support the build out of major next generation supercomputers among them that the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit System expected to be the world’s most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also announced new wins such as Japan’s fastest AI supercomputer, the ABCI system, which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs.
Importantly, we are starting to see the conversions of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster. Modern supercomputers will need to support multiprocessing computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing. By combining AI with HPC, supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitude greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics.
We are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare. We announced engagements with GE Health and Nuance in medical imaging, Baker Hughes, a GE company in oil and gas and Japan Komatsu in construction and mining.
Moving to professional visualization, fourth quarter revenue grew to a record 254 million, up 13% from a year ago, up 6% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 30% of pro visualization sales.
We saw strength across several key industries including defense, manufacturing, energy, healthcare and internet service providers among key customers high end quality products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization.
Turning to automotive. In automotive for fourth quarter, revenue grew 3% on year to 132 million and was down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline reflects our condition from infotainment which is becoming commoditized to next generation AI cockpits systems and complete top to bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software.
At CES, we demonstrated our leadership position in autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnership that point to AI self-driving cars, moving from deployment to production. In a scanning room only key note that drew nearly 8,000 attendees, Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier the world's first autonomous machine processor will be available to customers this quarter with more than 9 billion transistors DRIVE Xavier is the most complex system on ever created.
We also announced in NVIDIA Drive is the world's first functionally saved AI self-driving platform, enabling automakers to create autonomous vehicles they can operate safely and necessary ingredient for going to market. Additionally, we announced a number of collaboration of CES including with Uber, which has been using in video technology for the AI continuing system and its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks.
We announced that ZF and Baidu are using NVIDIA Drive self-driving technology to create a production ready AI autonomous vehicle platform for China, the world's largest automotive market. Production vehicles utilizing this technology including those from chariots expected on the road by 2020. We also announced partnership with Aurora which is working to create a modular scalable Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform incorporating the NVIDIA Drive Xavier processor.
Jen-Hsun Huang joined on stage by Volkswagen CEO, Herbert Diess, they announced the new generation of intelligently VW vehicles for using NVIDIA Drive intelligent experience or drive IX, platform to create the new AI infused cockpit experiences and improved safety. Later CES, Mercedes-Benz announced that MBUX its new AI based smart cockpit uses NVIDIA graphics in the AI technologies. The MBUX user experience which includes beautiful touch screen displays and a new voice activated assistant, they viewed it last week at Mercedes-Benz A-Class compact car and we will shift this frame. And earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Continental to build AI self-driving vehicle systems from enhanced Level 2 to Level 5 for production in 2021.
There are now more than 320 companies and research institutions using the NVIDIA Drive platform that’s up 50% from a year ago and encompasses virtually every car marker, truck maker, robo-taxi company, mapping company, center manufacture and self starter in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the inter-meet to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving.
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 61.9% and non-GAAP was 62.1%, record that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $728 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $607 million up 28% and 22% year-over-year respectively. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and automotive.
GAAP EPS was $1.78, up 80% from a year earlier, some of the upside was driven by a lower than expected tax rate, as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation. Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7% compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was a $1.72, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5% compared with our expectation of 17.5%.
We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash from operations reached record levels at $1.36 billion, bringing our fiscal year total to a record $3.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $469 million for the four quarter, inclusive of $335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building.
Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go forward financials. In Q4, we reported a GAAP only one-time net tax benefit of $133 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of foreign earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax hence the one-time benefit.
For fiscal 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12% which is down from approximately 17% previously. This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation, which depending stock price investing schedule could increase or decrease our tax rate in GAAP in a given quarter.
In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business as we see significant opportunities ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx such as adding engineering talent as well as CapEx such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, with our plan remaining at $1.25 billion for fiscal 2019.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.7% and 63% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $770 million and $645 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&Es are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 12% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items.
For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect our operating expenses to grow at a similar pace as in Q1. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, I like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 13th and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on February 26th. We will also be hosting our Annual Investor Day on March 27th in Sam Hose on the sidelines of our annual GPU Technology Conference, which we are very excited about.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you pole for questions please. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore. I guess first question when I think about normal seasonality for gaming that would imply data center potentially more than $700 million plus into the coming quarter. And so, curious if I am thinking about that right whether crypto has been modeled more conservatively by you guys, and so would love to hear your thoughts there? Which way is more conservatively? Yes, sorry. When you say conservatively, which direction are you saying was are you implying up or down? Well curiously to your thoughts there. We model crypto approximately flat. Okay. And then I guess as part of the larger question. How are you thinking about seasonality for gaming into the quarter? Well, there are a lot of dynamics going on in gaming, what dynamic of course is that there is a fairly sizable pent up demand going into this quarter. But I think a larger dynamics that are happening relate to just a really amazing games that are out right now. PUBG is doing incredibly well as you might have known and it’s become a global phenomenon and whether it’s here in United States or Europe or in China, in Asia. PUBG is just doing incredibly well and we expect other developers that come with up similar genre like PUBG that can become in the near future and I am super excited about these games.
And there is of course Call of Duty, there is Star Wars that, there are just only so many great games around the market like today. Overwatch and League of Legends are still doing well. They just catalyst number of great franchises that are out in the marketplace and the gaming market is growing and production valley is going up and that's driving increased unit sales of GPUs as well as APSs of GPUs. And so, I think those are that’s probably the larger dynamic of gaming. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lopasif with Jefferies.
Q - Mark Lopasif
The first question, the checks we've done indicate that the Tensor Core you put into Volta give it a huge advantage in neural network applications in the data center. I am wondering whether the Tensor Core might also have a similar kind of utility in the gaming market? Yes, first of all I appreciate you are asking a Tensor Core question. It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers. Our GPU the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs, and one of our multi-GPUs would take something along the lines of 20 plus GPUs or 10 plus notes. And so one GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would 10 plus CPU powered server notes to keep it with. And then Tensor Core comes along last year and we increased the throughput of deep learning, increased the computation throughput deep learning by another factor of eight. And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPU, it's very unlike a CPU when the instruction sets remain locked for a long-term and its hard, it's difficult to advance.
In the case of our GPUs and with could that’s one of its fundamental advantages, we can continue to year in and year out, continue to add new facilities to it. And so Tensor Core boost of the original great performance of our GPU is really raised the bar last year. And as ColetteI said earlier, our Volta GPU has now been adopted all over the world whether it's in China with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, iFlytek too. Here in United States Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and IBM and Oracle. And in Europe and Japan, the number of cloud service provides that have adopted Volta has been terrific.
And I think I already really appreciated the work that we did with Tensor Core and although the updates they are now coming out from the frameworks, Tensor Core is the new instruction fit and new architecture and the deep learning developers have really jumped on it and almost every deep learning frame work is being optimized to take advantage of Tensor Core. On the inference side, on the inference side and that’s where it would play a role in video games. You could use deep learning now to synthesize and to generate new art, and we been demonstrating some of that as you could see, if you could you seen some of that whether it improve the quality of textures, generating artificial, characters, animating characters, whether its facial animation with for speech or body animation.
The type of work that you could do with deep learning for video games is growing. And that’s where Tensor Core to take up could be a real advantage. If you take a look at the computational that we have in Tensor Core compare to a non optimized GPU or even a CPU, it's now to plus orders of magnitude on greater competition of throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time and synthesize virtual world and make characters and make faces, bringing a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to the video games. Your next question comes from line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Jen-Hsun just a near and longer term question on the data center. Near-term you would have a number of strong quarters in data center, how is the utilization of these GPU? And how do you measure whether you're over or under from a supply prospective? And then longer them, there seems to be a lot of money going into startup developing silicon for deep learning. Is there any advantage they’ve been taking a clean sheet approach? Or is GPU the most optimal answer? Like, if you were starting a new company looking at AI today, would you make another GPU or would you make another ASIC or some other format? Just any color would be helpful? Sure. In the near-term, the best way to measure customers that are already using our GPUs for deep learning is repeat customers. When they come back another quarter, another quarter and they continue to buy GPUs that would suggest that the workflows continue to increase. The -- with existing customers that already have a very deep penetration, another opportunity for us would be using our GPUs for inference and that’s an untapped growth opportunity for our company that's really, really exciting, we're traction there.
For companies that are not at the forefront, the absolute forefront of deep learning, which -- with the exception of one or two or three hyperscalers, almost everybody else I’ll put in this category. And their deployment, their adoption of deep learning, applying deep learning to all of their applications, is still ongoing. And so I think the second wave of our customers is just showing up. And then there is a third wave of customer which is, they're not hyperscalers, they are internet service -- service applications, internet applications for consumers. They have enormous customer basis and that they could apply to artificial intelligence to, but they run their application in hyperscale clouds.
That third phase of growth is now really spiking and I'm excited about that. And so that's kind of the way to think about it. The pioneers and the first phase are the training customers. Then there is the second phase that’s now ramping. The third phase, that’s now ramping. And then for everybody, we have an opportunity to apply our GPUs for inference. If I had all the money in the world, and I had for example billions and billions of dollars of R&D, I would give it to NVIDIA’s GPU team, which is exactly what I do.
And the reason for that is because GPU was already inherently the world's best high throughput computational processor. A high throughput processor is a lot more complicated than a linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsys tool stores. It's not quite that easy. The computation throughput keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency, with all of the software that is -- that’s needed to keep the data flowing with all of the optimizations and you do with each and every one of the frameworks. The amount of complexity there is just really enormous.
The networks are changing all the time, it started out with just basically CNNs and then all kinds of versions of CNNs, now it started out with RNNs and simple RNNs and now there is kinds of LSTMs and gated RNNs and all kinds of interesting networks they're growing. It’s started out with just eight layers and now its 152 layers, going to a 1,000 layers. It started with mostly recognition and now it’s moving to synthesis with GANs. And there's, so many versions of GANs. And so, all of these different types of networks are really, really hard to nail down and we're still at the beginning of AI. So, the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks, it's just an enormous advantage.
You don't ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs. It could be used for one particular network and other. And so you can buy our GPUs at well and know that every single GPU that you buy gives an opportunity to reduce the number of servers and you data center by 22 nodes, by 10 nodes, 22 CPUs. And so the more GPU you buy, the more money you save. So, I think that capability is really quite unique and like I just give one example from last year or from previous year, we introduced a 16-bit mixed precision, we introduced 8-bit imager, we introduced -- the year before this last year.
This last year, we introduced Tensor core which increased by another factor of nearly 10. Meanwhile our GPUs get more complex, imager efficiency gets better and better every single year and the software origin gets more amazing. And so, it’s a much harder problem than just a multiply accumulator. Artificial intelligence is the single most complex mono software that world is ever known that’s the reason why it’s taken so long to get here, and these high performance supercomputers is an essential ingredient, an essential instrument in advancing AI. And so, I don’t think it’s nearly as simple as liner algebra. But you might have all the money in the world, I would invest it in the team that we have. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. I have a question for Colette. So if I correct for the switch revenue growth in the quarter, it means that the gaming business X which was at maybe $140 million or $150 million. In your Q3 commentary, you did not call out crypto was a driver. You are calling out it in Q4. Is it fair to say that like that incremental growth is all crypto? And I guess going forward, you mentioned pent up demand, normally your seasonality for gaming will be down probably double digit. Do you think that pent up demand is enough to reverse that normal seasonal pattern or normally down? And frankly, do you think gamers can even find GPU at retail at this point to buy in order to satisfy that pent up demand? So, let me comment on first one. We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well. We indicated how much we had in OEM boards and we also indicated that there was definitely some with our GTX business. Keep in mind that’s very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customers view. But yes, there is also some in our Q3 and we did comment all that. So here, we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4. It’s up a bit from what we saw in Q3 and we do again expect probably going forward. Although, Jen-Hsun answered regarding the demand for gamers as we move forward. Yes, so one way to think about the Tensor demand as we typically have somewhere between six to eight weeks for inventory in the channel, and I think you would ascertain that globally right now the channels relatively lean. We're working really hard to get GPU down to the marketplace for the gamers and we’re doing everything to advise retailers and system builders to serve the gamers. And so, we’re doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is we just got to catching for supply. Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC. And I just want to circle back with autos and so with at CES, so it's kind of on track for towards calendar year '19 in that what we see the autonomous kind of ASP uplift. And just the clarify the expected ASP uplift, all around $1,000, is that all right? Yes, it just depends on mix. I think for autonomous vehicle that still have drivers passenger cars, branded cars, ASP anywhere from $500 to $1,000 makes sense. For robot taxies where they are driverless, they are not autonomous vehicles they are actually drivers less vehicles, the ASP will be several $1,000. And in terms of timing, I think that you’re going to see a larger and larger deployment starting this year, and I'm going through next year for sure especially with robust taxies. And then with autonomous vehicles, cars that have autonomous driving capability, automotive driving capability start late 2019, you could see a lot more in 2020 and just almost every creating car by 2022 will have autonomous automatic driving capabilities. Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Jen-Hsun, I was hoping to ask a little bit about inferencing. How big was inferencing within data center in Q4 or fiscal '18? And more importantly, how do you expect that the trend over the next 12 to 18 months? First of all just the comment about inference, the way that it works as you take the output of these frameworks and the output of these frameworks is a really complex large computational graph. And when you think about these neural networks and they have millions of parameters, millions of parameters, millions of anything is very complex. And these parameters are ways in activation layers and activation functions and they are millions of them. And it's million of them composes consist of this computational graph. And this computational graph has all kind of interesting and complicated layers.
And so you take this computation graphic that comes out of each one of these frameworks and they all are different, they're in different formats, they're in different styles, they're different architectures and they are all different. And you take these computational graphs and you have to find a way to compile it, to optimize this graph, to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold, reduce the amount of conflict across all of the recourses that are in your GPU or your processor. And these conflicts could be on to memory and register follows, data paths and it could be the fabric, it could be the framework of interface, it could be the amount of memory.
But you got this computers are really complicated across all these different processors, and the interconnect between GPU, the network connects multiple notes, and so you kind figure out what all these different complex are, resources are and compile and optimize to take advantage of to keep it moving all the time. And so, TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation, graph complier. And it targets each one of our processors, the way it targets Xavier is different than way it targets Volta and the way it targets our inference, the way it targets for low energy for different precisions. Now, all of that targeting is a little bit is different. And so first of all TensorRT, the software of inference that's really where the magic is.
Then, the second thing that we do, we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks afford to have 8 bit imager or even less, some really can barely get by with 16 bit floating point and some you really would like to keep it at 32 bit floating point. So, that you don't have to expect and guess about any precisions that you lost along the way. And so, we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph, computational graph complier to processors that are very high throughout that makes precision. Okay. So that’s kind of the background. We start -- we've been sampling our Tesla P4, which is our data center inference processor.
And we’re seeing just really existing response. And this quarter, we started shipping, we’re looking outwards. My sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training, and the wonderful thing is everything that you train our processor will inference wonderfully in our processors as well. And the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for uploading inference and training, the more money they save.
And the amount of money they save is not 20% or 50%, its factors of 10%. The money savings for all these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic. And then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines, which is self-driving cars. TensorRT also targets Xavier, TensorRT targets our Pegasus, a robot taxi computer and they all have to inference incredibly efficiently, so that we can sustain real-time, keeping energy level low and keep the cost low, keep the cost low for core companies. Okay. So I think inference is a very important work for us. It is very complicated work and we’re making great progress. Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Just kind of curious as you look at the gaming business, I have kind of lost track with seasonality as you really have a big ramp ahead. And I’m just kind of curious as we think about Pascal of our seasonality ahead of Volta, if you could just kind of extrapolate as you look out into April and maybe July? Well, we don't -- we haven’t announced 2018 for April or July. And so the best way to think about that is, Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet. It is the most future feature rich software. The most energy efficient and from $99 to $1,000 you can buy the world’s best GPU, the most advanced GPUs and you buy Pascal you know you got the best. Seasonality is a good question and increasingly because gaming is a global market and because people play games every day. It’s just part of their life.
There is no -- I don’t think there is much seasonality in the TV or books or music, people just whenever new titles comes out that’s when the new season starts. And so in China, there is iCafes and there is Singles' Day November 11, there is Back to School in the United States, there is Christmas, there is Chinese New Year. Boy, that there are so many seasons that is kind of hard to imagine what exactly seasonality is anymore. So hopefully overtime, it becomes most of a matter. But most appointing is that, we expect Pascal to continue to be world’s best gaming platform for foreseeable future. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. I know somebody asked a question about inferencing for the data center market, but on inferencing embedded in Edge application on the software and firmware side. You talked about TensorRT framework, on the hardware side you got the Jetson TX platform embedded and Edge inferencing applications things like drones and factory automation and transportation. What else is the team doing in the embedded market to capture more of the same opportunities that are going forward? Thanks a lot, Harlan. The video Tensor RT is really the only optimizing inference compiler in the world today and it targets all our platforms. And we do inference in the data center that I mentioned earlier. In the embedded world, the first embedded platform we’re targeting is self-driving cars. In order to drive the cars, you are basically inference or try to predict your perceive what's around you all the time and that’s a very complicated inference matter. It could be extremely easy like taking the car in front of you and applying the breaks or could be critically hard which is trying to figure out whether you should stop in intersection or not. If you look at most intersections, you can't just look at the lights to determine and where do you stop there were few lines.
And so using scene understanding than using deep learning, we have the ability to recognize where to stop and where not to stop. And then for Jetson, we have a platform called Metropolis and Metropolis is used for a very large scale smart cities where cameras are deployed all over to keep city safe. We’ve been very successful in smart cities just about every major smart city provider and what's called intelligent video analysis company whether almost all over the world as using NVIDIA’s video platform to do inference at the Edge, AI at the edge.
And then we’ve announced recently success with FANUC, the largest manufacturing robotics company in the world, Komatsu, one of the largest constructions equipments company in the world to apply AI at the Edge for autonomous machines. Drones, we’ve several industrial drones that are inspecting pipelines and expecting power lines, flying over large spans of farms to figure out where to spay insecticides more accurately. There is all kinds of applications. So, you're absolutely right that inference at the Edge or AI at the edge is a very large market opportunity for us and that’s exactly why TensorRT was created. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You mentioned how lean the channel is in terms of gaming cards. There has been an absorbable increase in prices at retail. And I am just curious, is that a broad-based phenomenal? And is there any economic ramification to you? Or is that just sort of retailers bringing prices up in a shortage environment? We don’t set prices at the end of the market, and the best way for us to solve this problem is, work and supply. The demand is great and it's very likely the demand will remain great as we look through this quarter. And so, we just have to keep working on increasingly supply. We have our suppliers are world best and a largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world and they’re responding incorrectly and I'm really grateful for everything they are doing, we dot got a catch up to that demand, which is such really great. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with Susquehanna. Just to clarify in terms of pent up demand, one of your GPU competitors basically said that constraints was memory. I just want to make sure that was correct? And then in the CFO commentary, you mentioned opportunities for professional biz, like AI and deep learning. Can you talk about that in more kind of application you would use Quadro versus Volta or GeForce Specs? We’re just constraints. Obviously, we're ten times larges of a GPU supplier than the competition and so we have a lot more suppliers supporting us and a lot more distributors taking approach to market and lot more partners distributing our products all over the world. And so, I don’t know how to explain this right from demand is just really great. And so we just got to keep our nose to it and catch up the demand.
With respect to Quadro, Quadro is a work station processor. The entire software stack is designed for all of the applications that the work station industry uses. And it’s the quality of the rendering is of course world-class because NVIDIA, but the entire software stack has been designed so that mission critical applications or long-life industrial applications and companies that are enormous and gigantic manufacturing and industrial companies in the world could rely on an entire platform, which consist of processors and systems and software and middleware and all the integrations into all of the CAD tools in the world.
To know that that the supplier is going to be here and can be trusted for the entire life of the use of that product which could be several years, but the data that is generated from it, has to be accountable for a couple of decades. You need to be able to pull up an entire design of a plane or train or a car, a couple decades after it was sent to production to make sure that is still on complaint, and if there is question about it that it could be pulled up. NVIDIA's entire platform was designed to be professional class, professional grade low-lived.
Now, the thing that's really exciting about some artificial intelligence is, we now can use AI to improve images. For example, you could fix a photograph using AI. You could fill in on damaged parts of a photograph or parts of the image that hasn't been rendered yet. You want to use AI to fill in the dots, predict the future, rendering results, which we announced and which we demonstrated at GTC recently. You can use that to generate designs. You sketch up a few strokes of what you want to car to look like, and based on the inventory, safety, physics, you could -- it has learned how to fill in the rest of it.
Okay. Design the rest of chasse on your behalf. It’s called generative design. We’re going to see generative design in product design and building design and just like everything. The last, if you will, 90% of the work is after the initial installation network, the conceptual design has done. That part of it could be highly automated through AI. And so, Quadro can be used as a platform that designs as well as generatively designs. And then lastly a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for the generative designs. And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications.
Okay. So, AI, think of AI really as, in the final analysis, the future way of developing software is a brand new capability where computers can write its own software and the software that's written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves. And so, you can teach, you can use data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself. And then when you're done developing the software, you can use it to do all kinds of stuff, including design products. And so for work stations that’s how it’s used. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Q - Craig Ellis
A lot of near-term items here on gaming. So, I’ll switch it to longer term. Jen-Hsun at CES, I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally, and if my math is correct then that would be up about 2X over the last three to four years. So the question is, is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period? And given the recent demand dynamics, I think we've seen that INVIDIA’s direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs of the prices that you intend. So as we look ahead, should we expect any change in channel management from the Company? Yes. Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of that were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became global market and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world. The second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of the videogame. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and though they are going to get return on. Back when the videogame industry was quite small or PC game was small, it was too risky for developer to invest that much.
And so now, an investor a developer could invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely for the realistic and emerged that just beautiful. And so when the production value goes up, the GPU technology that’s needed to run it well goes up, it’s very different than music, it’s very different than watching movies, everything in videogames is emphasized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP with a technology has to go up.
And then lastly, the size of the market and people wonder how big the videogame market is going to be and I am always believe that videogame market is going to be literally everyone. In 10 years time, 15 years time, there can be another billion people on earth and those people are going to be gamers, we see more and more gamers. And not to mention that almost every single sport could be the virtual reality sport. So videogame is every sport so this sport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport. And so I think when you consider this and put that in your mind I think the opportunity for videogames is going to be quite large and that’s essentially what we’re seeing. Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. I am hoping we can touch on automotive a little bit more. In particular, I think in the past you’ve talked about expecting sort of a low in revenue growth in this market and till roughly the 2020 timeframe when autonomous driving kicks in more meaningful way. But of course you have the AI co-pilot that seems to be potentially ramping sooner, and you have at least one marquee customer that is ramping now I guess that volumes aren’t quite that large on the autonomous driving side. So any guidance as to when we might see these two factors start to accelerate revenue in that end market? Yes, thanks a lot Will. I wish I have more precision for you, but here some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capability, autonomous driving is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles. I mean it just an extraordinary market and everything that’s kind of move in the future will be autonomous that’s for sure, and it will be autonomous fully or it will be autonomous partly. The size of this marketplace is quite large.
In the near term, our path to that future which I believe starts in 2019 and 2020, but starts very strongly in 2022. I believe the path to that in our case has several elements. The first element is that in work for all these companies, whether they are Tier 1s or start up or OEMs or taxi companies or ride hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or piece of delivery on the shuttles. In order to deliver -- in order to create there autonomous driving capability, the first thing I have to do is train in your network. And we created a platform we called the NVIDIA GTX that allows everybody to train a neural networks as quickly as possible.
So that first, it’s the development of the AI requires GPU, and we benefit first from that. And the second is, which will start this year and next year is development platforms for the cars themselves, for the vehicles themselves. And finally, Xavier here, we have a first kind of Xavier, the most complex SoC that the world ever made. And we’re super excited about the state of Xavier and we're going to be sampling in Q1. And so now, we will be able to help everybody create development systems and will be 1000s and 10,000s of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on that Pegasus that world is going to need.
And so that’s the second element, the third element in the near-term will be development agreements, each one of these projects are engineering intensive. And there is a development agreement that goes along way with it. And so these three elements, these three components are in the near-term, and then hopefully starting from 2019 going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond at the actual car revenues and economics will show up.
I appreciate the question and I think this is our last question. Well, we have a record quarter ramping up with record year. We've strong momentum and our gaming, AI, data center and self-driving car businesses. It's great to see adoption of the NVIDIA's GPU computing platform increasing in so many industries. We accomplished a great deal this last year and we have big plans for this coming year. Next month, the brightest minds and AI and scientific world will come together at our GPU technology conference at San Jose.
GTC has grown tenfold in the last five years. This year we expect more than 8,000 attendees. GTC has a place to be if you're an AI researchers or doing any field of science where computing is your essential instrument, there will be over 500 powers of talks of recent breakthroughs and discoveries by leaders in the field just Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and many others. Developers from industries ranging from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing entertainment will come together and share state-of-the-art and AI. This is going to be a big GTC. I hope to see all of you there. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to NVIDIA's financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until May 16, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All our statements are made as of today, May 10, 2018, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with growth across all our platforms led by gaming and datacenter. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-over-year, up 10% sequentially and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records, with GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margins at 40.4% and net income at $1.24 billion.
From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million.
Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform.
We also continue to see demand from upgrades with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles, like Far Cry 5 and Final Fantasy XV continued to drive excitement in the quarter.
Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport, while the production value of games continues to increase. This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs.
At the recent Game Developers Conference, we announced our real-time ray tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX. Ray tracing is movie quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows. This has long been considered the holy grail of graphics, and we've been working on it for over 10 years.
We look forward to seeing amazing, cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year, with the pipeline building into next year and beyond. And we expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers' requirements for higher GPU performance.
While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we were pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price.
Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level.
Gaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform's continued success.
Moving to datacenter, we had another phenomenal quarter with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI. Adoption of our Volta architecture remained strong across a wide range of verticals and customers.
In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 instances joining Amazon, IBM and Oracle. And Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer Internet companies also continued their ramp of Volta, which delivers five times the deep learning performance of its predecessor, Pascal.
Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning.
In high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp down of major supercomputing projects such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit system. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries, from manufacturing to oil and gas, which should help sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond.
Traction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more than doubled from last quarter. And our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software at our recent GPU Technology Conference in San Jose.
TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications, such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA's market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide.
At GTC, we also announced other major advancements in our deep learning platform. We doubled the memory of Tesla V100 to 32 GB VRAM, which is a key enabler for customers building virtual networks for larger data sets. And we announced a new GPU interconnect fabric called NVIDIA NVSwitch, which joins up to 16 V100 GPUs at a speed of 2.4 terabytes per second or five times faster than the best PCIe switch.
We also announced our DGX-2 system, which leverages these new technologies and is updated, fully optimized software stack to deliver a 10x performance boost beyond last year's DGX. DGX-2 is the first single-server capable of delivering 2 petaflops of computational power. We are seeing strong interest from both hyperscale and enterprise customers and we look forward to bringing this technology to cloud customers later this year.
At our Investor Day in March, we updated our forecast for the datacenter addressable market. We see the datacenter opportunity as very large, fueled by growing demand for accelerated computing in applications ranging from AI to high performance computing across multiple market segments and vertical industries. We estimate the TAM at $50 billion by 2023, which extends our previous forecast of $30 billion by 2020.
We see strong momentum in the adoption of our accelerated computing platform and the expansion of our development ecosystem to serve this rapidly growing market. About 8,500 attendees registered for GTC, up 18% from last year. CUDA downloads have continued to grow, setting a fresh record in the quarter. And our total number of developers is well over 850,000, up 72% from last year.
Moving to pro visualization, revenue grew to $251 million, up 22% from a year ago and accelerating from last quarter, driven by demand for real-time rendering, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, healthcare and retail.
Key wins in the quarter included Columbia University, using high-end Quadro GPUs for AI, and Siemens, using them for CT and ultrasound solutions. At GTC, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world.
RTX makes computational intensive ray tracing possible in real time, when running professional design and content creation applications. This allows media and entertainment professionals to see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows and do complex renders up to 10 times faster than a CPU alone.
And the NVIDIA OptiX AI denoiser built into RTX delivers almost 100 times the performance of CPUs for real-time noise-free rendering. This enables customers to replace racks of servers in traditional render farms with GPU servers at one-fifth the cost, one-seventh the space and one-seventh the power.
Lastly, automotive. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to a record $145 million. This reflects the ongoing transition from our infotainment business to our growing autonomous vehicle development and production opportunities around the globe. At GTC and Investor Day, we made key product announcements on the advancement of autonomous vehicles and established a total addressable market opportunity of $60 billion by 2035.
We believe that every vehicle will be autonomous one day. By 2035, this will encompass 100 million autonomous passenger vehicles and 10 million robo taxis.
We also introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a platform that will help car companies, carmakers, Tier 1 suppliers and others developing autonomous vehicle test and validate their systems in a virtual world across a wide range of scenarios before deploying on the road.
Each year, 10 trillion miles are driven around the world. Even if test cars can eventually cover millions of miles, that's an insignificant fraction of all the scenarios that require testing to create a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle.
DRIVE Constellation addresses this challenge by enabling cars to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality.
The platform has two different servers. The first is loaded with GPUs and simulates the environment that the car is driving in, as in a hyper real video game.
The second contains the NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus autonomous vehicle computer, which possesses the simulated data, as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road. Real-time driving command from the DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulation for true hardware-in-the-loop verification.
Constellation will enable autonomous vehicle industry for safety test and validate their AI self-driving systems in ways that are not practical or possible with on-road testing.
We also extended our product roadmap to include our next-generation DRIVE autonomous vehicle computer.
We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of autonomous driving, from traffic jams, pilots, to level 5 robo taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are now using NVIDIA's automotive platform. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for our autonomous driving business.
Now moving to the rest of the P&L, Q1 GAAP gross margins were 64.5% and non-GAAP was 64.7%, records that reflect continued growth in our value added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $773 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $648 million, up 25% year-on-year.
We continue to invest in key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP net income was a record $1.24 billion and EPS was $1.98, up 45% (sic) [145%] (15:33) and 151% respectively from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate of 5% compared to our guidance of 12%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.29 billion and EPS was $2.05, both up 141% from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength as well as gross margins and operating margin expansion and slightly lower tax.
Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.45 billion. Capital expenditures were $118 million.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.6% (sic) [63.3%] (16:26) and 63.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $810 million and $685 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $15 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, I'd like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference next week on May 15 and at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5. We will also hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on May 16.
We will now open the call for questions. Simona and I are here in Santa Clara and Jensen is dialing in from the road. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you. Your first question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I had a question on gaming seasonality. It's usually down pretty decently in Q1. It was obviously flat this time as you were trying to fill up the channel. Now that's done. I was just wondering what the supply demand dynamics as well as like any thoughts on crypto might mean for typical – the seasonality into Q2 versus what would be typical where it would usually be down – or usually be up pretty decently. How are you looking at it? And this is a question for Colette. Jensen, why don't you start on the question for Stacy and I'll follow-up afterwards after you speak. Okay. Hi Stacy, so let's see. Q1, as you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons (sic) [phenomena] (18:51). The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond comprehension, really. Those two games are a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world. And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on GPUs from all over the world.
Surely, there was scarcity as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter and it drove prices up. And I think that a lot of the gamers weren't able to buy into the new GeForce as a result. And so we're starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize. It's still higher than where they should be. And so obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there.
But my sense is that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. And then we've got some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really, is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. And so I think there's a fair – I mean the simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG. And the demand is just really great. They did a great job. Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I wonder – Colette had talked about the inference doubling in sales quarter-over-quarter with cloud. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the early applications for inference? Is that sort of as-a-service business or are you looking at internal cloud workloads? And just any color you can give us on where you guys are sitting in the inference space. Thank you. Sure hi Joe. So as you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. And they were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this neural network – and the software that's written by deep learning in these frameworks are massive software. The way to think about these deep neural nets is it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it and these networks are getting larger every year. And they're enormously complex. And the output of these neural nets have to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets.
How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very, very different. And how you optimize for different neural networks, whether it's image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures and an optimizing compiler that's necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex.
And so that's why we created TensorRT. That's what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler. And it optimizes for each one of our platforms. And even each one of our platforms has very different architectures. For example, we invented recently – reinvented the GPU and it's called the Tensor Core GPU, and the first of its kind is called Volta. And so TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models.
The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video for example all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you're uploading. All of these types of applications are going to require enormous amount of computation. Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and the consistent execution. Jensen, I have two questions about the datacenter, one, from a growth and the second from a competition perspective. So from the growth side, you guys are doing about, say, $3 billion or so annualized but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you grow and address that $50 billion market, right, because you have only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So what needs to change for the next inflection point?
And then on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like a Google announcing a TPU 3.0 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies? So any color on both sort of how you look at growth and competition would be very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Vivek. First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now, that CPU scaling has really slowed. And if you think about the several hundred billion dollars worth of computer equipment that's been installed in the cloud, in datacenters all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed.
And so here is the approach that we pioneered a decade and a half ago called GPU computing. And we've been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believe that it was going to end. I mean, you can't deny physics. And so we find ourselves in a great position today.
And as Colette already mentioned, we have something close to 1 million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50, 100 times, 200 times sometimes depending on the algorithm. It's everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super rich. And as Colette mentioned, there's already almost 1 million developers around the world that's grown 70% year-over-year. And so I think at the core, it's about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward.
With respect to our ability to address the TAM, there are three major segments. There's more than that, but there's three major segments. One is of course training for deep learning. The other is inferencing and TRT 4 is intended to do just that to expand our ability to address all of the different types of algorithms, machine learning algorithms that are running in the datacenters.
The third is high-performance computing and that's molecular dynamics, to medical imaging, to earth sciences, to energy sciences. The type of algorithms that are being run in supercomputers all over the world is expanding. And we're doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. And then the last category would be graphics virtualization.
We've taken with GRID and our Quadro Virtual Workstation and now with NVIDIA RTX, we turned the datacenter into a powerful graphics supercomputer. And so these are the various applications and segments of datacenter that we see. I think in the case of training, we're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world.
And that's growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There's a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge. And so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference. And I've already talked about that. It's really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run our processors. And if we could do so, we're going to save our customers enormous amounts of money.
We speed up applications. We speed up these neural network models 50 times, 100 times, 200 times over a CPU. And so the more GPUs they buy, the more they're going to save. And high-performance computing, the way to think about that is, I think, at this point, it's very clear that going forward, supercomputers are going to get built with accelerators in them. And because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we're going to do super well in the supercomputing world. And so these are the different verticals.
With respect to competition, it all starts with the core. And the core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. And so the world needs another approach going forward. And surely because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced TPU 3.0 and it's still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It's called Tensor Core GPUs. And we're far ahead of the competition and – but more than that, it's programmable. It's not one function. It's programmable.
Not only is it faster, it's also more flexible. And as a result of the flexibility, developers could use it in all kinds of applications, whether it's medical imaging or weather simulations or deep learning or computer graphics. And as a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every datacenter, everywhere on the planet and which developers need so that – accessibility, so that they could develop their software.
And so I think that on the one hand, it's too simplistic to compare a TPU to just one of the many features that's in our Tensor Core GPU. But even if you did, we're faster. We support more frameworks. We support all neural networks.
And as a result, if you look at GitHub, there are some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And it's just a handful for the second alternative. And so I'd just kind of gave you a sense of the reach and the capabilities of our GPUs. Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Great. Thank you so much. Jensen, I had a question regarding your decision to pull the plug on your GeForce Partner Program. I think most of us read your blog from last Friday. I think it was, so we understand the basic background. But if you can describe what led to this decision and perhaps talk a little bit about the potential implications, if any, in terms of your ability to compete or gain share. That will be really helpful. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks for your question, Toshiya. At the core, the program was about making sure that gamers who buy graphics cards knows exactly the GPU brand that's inside. And the reason for that is because, we want gamers to – the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen.
And we felt that using one gaming brand, a graphics card brand, and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less – causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted. And most of the ecosystem loved it. And some of the people really disliked it.
And so instead of all that distraction, we're doing so well. And we're going to continue to help the gamers choose the graphics cards, like we always have, and things will sort out. And so we decided to pull the plug because the distraction was unnecessary and we have too much good stuff to go do. Next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Hi. This is Sajal Dogra calling in for C.J. Muse. Thank you for taking my question. So I had a question on HPC. TSMC, on their recent call, raised their accelerator attach rate forecast in HPC to 50% from mid-teens. So I would love to get further details on what exactly NVIDIA is doing to software services, et cetera, that's kind of creating this competitive positioning in HPC and AI basically. And then, if I could ask a follow-up basically in benchmarks. So, there's been some news on AI benchmarks whether it's Stanford DAWNBench et cetera. So I would love to get your thoughts on A, the current state of benchmarks for AI workloads and B, your relative positioning of ASICs versus GPUs especially as we move towards newer neural networks like RN and GAN, et cetera. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question. Well, HPC. First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it's reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach a decade and half ago. And I think at this point, with the number developers jumping on, the number of applications that's emerging, it's really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create that as a result of the throughput of a datacenter, we save people so much money just in cables alone, often times, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. And the reason for that is because the number of servers reduced dramatically. And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that's been created.
With respect to benchmarks, you might have seen that earlier this week, we released three speed records: the fastest single GPU, the fastest single computer node, a definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system, one node; and one instance, one cloud instance. We now have the fastest speed record for one GPU, one node, and one instance.
And so we love benchmarks. Nothing is more joyful than having a benchmark to demonstrate your leadership position. And in the world of deep learning, the number of networks is just growing so fast, because the number of different applications that deep learning is able to solve is really huge. And so you need a lot of software capability and the versatility of your platform needs to be great.
We also have a lot of expertise in the company in software. I mean, NVIDIA is really a full stack computing company, from architecture, to system software, to algorithms, to applications. We have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so we love these complicated benchmarking – benchmarks that are out there. And I think this is a great way for us to simplify our leadership position.
I think long-term, the number of networks that are going to emerge will continue to grow. And so the flexibility of ASICs is going to be its greatest downfall. And if someone were to create a general-purpose parallel accelerating processor like ours and had it designed to be incredibly good at deep learning, like recently what we did with our Tensor Core GPU, which is a reinvented GPU, and Volta is the first one, it's going to be hard. It's going to be expensive. And we've been doing it a very long time. And so I think this is a – it's a great time for us. Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, maybe – I wanted to ask on inference side about edge inference and beyond autos when you look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs in edge inference besides autos? Yeah, Blayne. The largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud and the datacenter. That's the first great opportunity. And the reason for that is there's just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. They're image recognition, there's video sequencing, there's video, there's recommender systems, there's speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding.
There are just so many different types of neural networks that are being created. And creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. And by the time that you create such a thing, it's called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. And so I think that the first opportunity for us in large-scale opportunity will be in the datacenter and the cloud.
The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market that you mentioned is self-driving cars. And we see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, both in the creation of autonomous vehicles. And I mentioned that before, between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we're going to be selling a whole lot of servers, so that the companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars, as well as simulating in virtual reality their various test drives, as well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved up pre-recorded videos.
And so in the vertical markets, we're going to see inference both in the datacenter for developing the self-driving car stack as well as in the self-driving cars themselves. Now, in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for Level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a Level 5 self-driving car, taxi or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars.
And I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019 and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021.
And I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. And the simple way to think about that is I believe that every single – everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities.
And so the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles, you name it. Everything is going to be autonomous. And the market opportunity is going to be quite large. And that's the reason why we're so determined to go create that market. Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Thank you. I actually wanted to go back to the question about seasonality for gaming in June. Normal seasonal sounds like it's up mid-teens for June in gaming. But obviously, the comps are skewed a little bit because of the channel restock and the crypto stuff. So does the guidance for June assume that gaming is better or worse than that mid-teens normal seasonal? Thank you. We're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality, if I understand your question. We're expecting Q2 to be better than Q1. And we're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality. Did that answer your question? Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. And I'd have a question for Colette. Colette, first thank you for breaking out crypto sales in the OEM line and guide for us. I have a question on your gross margins. Your gross margins have been expanding on product mix, despite component pricing headwinds on the DRAM side. When do you expect component pricing to become a tailwind to your gross margins? Thanks so much for the question. When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs.
We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast generally when those pricing of those components will stabilize.
But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that. But I think we have tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins. Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. My question is the progress on the deployment of Volta into the cloud service providers. You talked in your prepared remarks about the five deployments, including the Google beta. Can you talk about how soon we can expect to see some of those remaining deployments? And of those already launched, how far are they along? I guess, to say proverbially, what inning are we in, in these deployments? Yes. So first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world's first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU.
It still retained all of the flexibilities of all – everything that CUDA has ever run is backwards compatible, with everything that runs on CUDA. But it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. And that's the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so Volta is really a breakthrough.
We're going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it. The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud providers, the Internet service companies for the vast majority of last quarter, as you guys know. And they're using it internally. And now they're starting to open up Volta for external consumption of their cloud customers. And they are moving as fast as they can. My expectation is that you're going to see a lot more coming online this quarter. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork is indicating very positive reception for DGX. And I was wondering, Jensen, if can you help us understand, the high-growth we've seen in the datacenter business, to what extent is that being driven by the DGX. And when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the back half of the year, is this something that kind of layers on top of DGX – does DGX-2 layer on top of DGX, are they going after different segments and you're kind of segmenting the market with these two different products? Any color on how to think about those two products would be helpful. Thank you Hey Colette, could you give me a brief version of that? It was kind of crackling on my side. So, I'm going to ask the operator if they could ask for the question again because it was also on our side a little crackly. Yes, Mark your line is open. Please restate your question. Okay, thanks. Can you hear me better now? Yeah, much better, Mark. Okay, sorry about that, I'm at the airport. So the question was on the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork indicates a very positive reception. I was wondering Jensen, if you could help us understand the high-growth you've seen in the datacenter market how much is DGX contributing to that. And then when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the second half of the year, how do we think about DGX-1? Does it replace the DGX – the original DGX, or going after different segments, or do they layer on top of one another? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you. I see. Thank you. DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. And DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It was introduced last year. So its growth rate is obviously very high. It's designed for enterprises where they don't – they need to have their computers on-premise, but they don't want to build a supercomputer. And they don't have the expertise to do so.
And they would like to pull a supercomputer out of a box, plug it in and start doing supercomputing. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises. It's designed for car companies; it's designed for healthcare companies doing life sciences work or medical imaging work. We recently announced a project called Project Clara, which basically takes medical imaging equipment, virtualizes them, containerizes the software and turns it into a – and most medical imaging equipment today are computational and they – a lot of them run on NVIDIA CUDA anyways.
We can put that into the datacenter, we can virtualize their medical instruments and it gives them the opportunity to upgrade the millions of instruments that are out in the marketplace today. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises and we're seeing great success there. It's really super easy to use and it comes with direct support from HPC and AI researchers at NVIDIA. And the answer to your question at the end is both of them will be in the marketplace at the same time. Next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Hey guys. I'm actually going to go to a more nitty-gritty question just on the financial side, just to make sure I'm understanding this right. So the OEM beat was pretty material given a lot of crypto revenue. Is it still the case that OEM is materially lower gross margin than your corporate average at this time? Sure, I'll take that question. Generally, our OEM business can be a little bit volatile. Because remember, OEM business incorporates our mainstream GPUs as well as our Tegra integrated.
So we have development platforms that we sell on some of the Tegra piece of it. But they are slightly below and I think you can go back and refer to our discussion at Investor Day as there's a slide there that talks about those embedded pieces and them being below. So yes, you're correct. Again, a very small part of our business right now. Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Hey, guys, thanks for the question. So your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto or like $150 million, $160 million. And you guys did almost $300 million there. And perhaps I think there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have two-thirds or more of that market?
So I guess what's going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there, or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market? Thanks. Well, we try to as transparently review our numbers as best we can. Our strategy is to create a SKU that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs and we call it CMP. And to be – as much as possible, fulfill their demand that way.
Sometimes, it's just not possible because the demand is too great but we try to do so. And we try to keep the miners on the CMP SKUs as much as we can. And so I'm not exactly sure how other people do it, but that's the way we do it. Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on all the financial records in the quarter. Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity and I think you noted at that time that it was very computationally intensive. So the question is as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we've seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high end capability, 1070 Ti launched late last year, it was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high end technology to market? Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us a decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for one decade. And to put it into perspective, it's basically film rendering, cinematic rendering except it's in real time.
It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework, so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time.
What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame.
So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If you take several hours per frame and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that's why they call it a render farm, it's a full datacenter designed just for rendering.
And now we've created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on four Quadro GV100s. It takes four of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire datacenter and reduced it into one node. And we're now doing it in real time.
And so the amount of money that we can save, people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There's quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then there are of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them.
And so that's our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it and hopefully, more GPU servers will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we're super excited about RTX. Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in for my follow-up. This is a question for Colette. I want to follow-up again on the seasonality. Understanding the prior comments, normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declining in Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around datacenter and the Volta ramp, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter? Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can bridge together, Jensen, and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they're moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn't able to add-on.
But let me see if I can add-on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of in the channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available.
We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately. And then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency only boards. So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand.
So that then takes you now to Q2. But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don't have to do those channel fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available.
So putting together, Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality, again, for a guidance. And we'll see how we'll finish in terms of the quarter. But you should be in that range.
So, yes, from a normal seasonality, at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2, yes, we're on that overall seasonality. Always keep in mind, generally, our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s, and that's what you should think about our overall guidance.
Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last three to five years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately.
I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are, in terms of gaming seasonality. Your last question comes from Will Stein with SunTrust. Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my question and squeezing me in. The question relates to the supply chain challenges that you talked so much about in the gaming end market.
I'm wondering if there's something particular to that end market that is making the shortages concentrated there, or are in fact other end markets in particular, the datacenter end market, also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have achieved if there weren't the shortages that are out there. And maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those. That'd be really helpful. Thanks so much. Let me start off here, and I'll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our datacenter business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well. And even now with 32-bit, we're seeing tremendous adoption throughout.
Again, remember it's very different than the overall consumer business. You have significant amount of time for qualification and that is moving extremely fast, based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of our datacenter. And our overall growth in datacenter, we're extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out.
I'll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it. Yeah. The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it's not any sovereign currency. And it's in the digital world, it's distributed. And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet.
Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC. And GeForce is so broadly distributed, it's available everywhere. And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along.
We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners. And they represent the vast majority of the demand. And to the best of our ability, serve their needs directly and we call that C&P (1:02:21) and that's why it's not called GeForce, they're called C&P (1:02:25). And we can serve those miners directly, hopefully to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market.
Because ultimately, what we would like is we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down, so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them.
And the gaming demand is strong. I mean, the bottom line is Fortnite is a homerun. The bottom line is PUBG is a homerun. And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic as people know very well.
And it's a global phenomenon. These two games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe as it is in the United States. And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale, you'd rather play with your friends. So it's incredibly social. It's incredibly sticky.
And more and more – more gamers that play, more of their friends join, and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. And so it's this positive feedback system, and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite. And it's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying.
And so I think at the core of it, gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant. And I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon. Unfortunately, we ran out of time. I will now turn it back over to Jensen for any closing remarks. Let's see here. Is it my turn again? Yes, it is. Okay. We had another great quarter, record revenue, record margins, record earnings, growth across every platform. Datacenter achieved another record with strong demand for Volta and AI inference. Gaming was strong. We are delighted to see prices normalizing and we can better serve pent-up gamer demand.
At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI just as traditional computing has slowed. The GPU computing approach that we've pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong position to power the AI era. I look forward to giving you another update next quarter. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, guys, for joining.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. This is a big week for NVIDIA. We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade. We can’t wait to tell you more about it. But first, let’s talk about the quarter.
We had another strong quarter, led by Datacenter and Gaming. Q2 revenue reached $3.12 billion, up 40% from a year earlier. Each market platform, Gaming, Datacenter, Pro Visualization, and Automotive hit record levels with strong growth, both sequentially and year-on-year. These platforms, collectively grew more than 50% year-on-year. Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million, while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million, and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward. Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year, while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Profit nearly doubled.
From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 40% from last year to $2.66 billion. Tegra Processor revenue grew 40% to $467 million.
Let’s start with our Gaming business. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up 52% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop, notebook, and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year. Notebooks were standout this quarter with strong demands for thin and right form factors, based on our Max-Q technology. Max-Q enables gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick, or less. All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top of the line gaming notebooks, just in time for back-to-school. And we expect to see 26 models, based on Max-Q, in stores, for the holidays.
The gaming industry remains vibrant. The eSports audience now approaches 400 million, up 18% over the past year. The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new Battle Royale genre, and expanded the gaming market. In fact, the Battle Royale mode is coming to games like the much anticipated Battlefield 5. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC gaming platform for the release of Battlefield 5 in October.
We’ve also partnered with Square Enix to make GeForce the best platform for its upcoming Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Monster Hunter World arrived on PCs earlier this month, and it was an instant hit. And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season. It’s not just new titles that are building anticipation.
The gaming community is excited of the Turing architecture, announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH. Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU, over a decade ago. The architecture includes new, dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT Cores, and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time.
We will enable the cinematic quality gaming, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models. Turing will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs. Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years of effort. It delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference swaps. This new architecture will be the foundation of new portfolio of products across our platforms going forward.
Moving to Datacenter. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $760 million, accelerating to 83% year-on-year growth and up 8% sequentially. This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI. Our GPUs power real-time services such as search, voice recognition, voice synthesis, translation, recommender engines, fraud detection, and retail applications. We also saw growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries, representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business.
Companies and sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services to transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerated computing platform to turn data into actionable insights.
Our flagship Tensor Core GPU, the Tesla V100, based on Volta architecture continued to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications. Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscaledatacenter operator around the world. Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100, which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32 gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks. Major server OEMs, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32 gig to market in the quarter.
We should continue to gain traction with AI inference solution which helped expand our addressable market in the datacenter. During the quarter, we released our TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software for general availability. While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads, TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, and recommendation systems. This means, we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads, delivering up to 190x performance speed-up relative to CPUs.
NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework, making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs. And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU, our small form factor GPU for AI inferenceand graphic virtualization is available on Google Cloud Platform.
Datacenter growth was also driven by DGX, our fully optimized AI server which incorporates V100 GPUs, our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack. The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. DGX-2, announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference, is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter.
At GTC Taiwan in June, we announced that we are bringing DGX-2 technology to our HGX-2 server platform. We make HGX-2 available to OEM and ODM partners, so they can quickly deploy our newest innovations in their own server designs.
In recent weeks, we announced partnerships with NetApp and Pure Storage to help customers speed AI deployment from month to days or even hours, with highly-integrated, optimized solutions that combine DGX with the company’s all-flash storage offerings and third-party networking.
At GTC Taiwan, we also revealed that we are -- set high speed records for AI training and inference influence. Key to our strategy is our software stack. From CUDA to our training and inference of SDKs as well as our work with developers to accelerate their applications. It is the reason we can achieve such dramatic performance gains in such a short period of time. And our developer ecosystem is getting stronger. In fact, we just passed 1 million members in our developer program, up 70% from one year ago.
One of our proudest moments this quarter was the launch of the Summit AI supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit is powered by over 27,000 Volta Tensor Core GPUs and helped the U.S. reclaim the number one spot on the TOP500 supercomputer list for the first time in five years. Other NVIDIA power systems joined the TOP500 list were Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the third spot and the ABCI Japan’s fastest supercomputer in the fifth spot, NVIDIA now powers five of the world’s seven fastest supercomputers, reflecting the broad shift in supercomputing to GPUs. Indeed, the majority of the computing performance added to the latest TOP500 list comes from NVIDIA GPUs and more than 550 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated. With our Tensor Core GPUs, supercomputers can now combine simulation with the power of AI to advance many scientific applications from molecular dynamics to seismic processing to genomics and material science.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue grew to $281 million, up 20% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering and mobile workstations, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 35% of Pro Visualization sales. Strength extended across several key industries including healthcare, oil and gas, and media and entertainment. Key wins in the quarter include Raytheon, Lockheed, GE, Siemens and Phillips Healthcare.
In announcing the Turing architecture at SIGGRAPH, we also introduced the first Turing-based processors, the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs, bringing interactive ray-tracing to world, years before it’s been predicted. We also announced that the NVIDIA RTX Server, a full ray-tracing global illumination rendering server that will give a giant boost to world’s render firms as Moore’s Law ends.
Turing is set to revolutionized the work of 5 -- 50 million designers and artists, enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to the workflows. Private GPUs based on the Turing will be available in the fourth quarter. Dozens of leading software providers, developers and OEMs have already expressed support for Turing. Our ProViz partners view it as a game-changer for professionals in the media and entertainment, architecture and manufacturing industries.
Finally, turning to Automotive. Revenue was a record $161 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagements around the globe, as well as the ramp of next-generation AI-based, smart cockpit infotainment solutions.
We continue to make progress on our autonomous vehicle platform with key milestones and partnerships announced this quarter. In July Daimler and Bosch selected DRIVE Pegasus as the AI brain for their level 4 and level 5 autonomous fleets. Pilot testing will begin next year in Silicon Valley. This collaboration brings together NVIDIA’s leadership in AI and self-driving platforms, Bosch’s hardware and systems expertise as the world’s largest tier 1 automotive supplier, and Daimler’s vehicle expertise and global brand synonymous with safety and quality.
This quarter, we started shipping development systems for DRIVE Pegasus, an AI supercomputer designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Pegasus delivers 320 trillion operations per second to handle diverse and redundant algorithms, and architected for safety as well as performance. This automotive grade, functionally safe production solution uses two NVIDIA Xavier SoCs and two next-generation GPUs, designed for AI and visual processing, delivering more than 10x greater performance and 10x higher data bandwidth compared to the previous generation. With co-designed hardware and software, the platform is created to achieve ASIL D ISO 26262, the industry’s highest level of automotive functional safety.
We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of automated and autonomous driving, from traffic jam pilots to level 5 robotaxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are using NVIDIA’s automotive platform. With this growing momentum and accelerating revenue growth, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business.
This quarter, we also introduced our Xavier platform for Jetson for the autonomous machine market. With more than 9 billion transistors, it delivers over 30 trillion operations per second, more processing capability than a powerful workstation or using one-third the energy of a light bulb. Jetson Xavier establishes customers to deliver AI computing at the edge, powering autonomous machines like robots or drones with applications in manufacturing, logistics, retail, agricultural, healthcare and more.
Lastly, in our OEM segment, revenue declined by 54% year-on-year and 70% sequentially. This was primarily driven by the sharp decline of cryptocurrency revenues to fairly minimal levels.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP was 63.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP operating expenses were $818 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $692 million, up 30% year-on-year. We can continue to invest in the key platforms, driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and Automotive.
GAAP net income was $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.76, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate near 7% compared to our outlook of 11%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.21 billion and EPS was $1.94, up 90% and 92%, respectively, from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength, as well as gross and operating margin expansion and lower taxes. Quarterly cash flow from operations was $913 million, capital expenditures were $128 million.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We are including no contribution from crypto in our outlook. We expect revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.6% and 62.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $870 million and $730 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million to $150 million.
Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, I’d like to highlight some of the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 6th and meeting with the financial community at our GPU technology conferences in Tokyo on September 13th and Munich on October 10th. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results is in the third quarter of 2019, will take place on November 15.
We will now open the call for questions. If you could limit your questions to one or two? And operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you. Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. The question is on ray-tracing. To what extent is this creating new markets versus enabling greater capabilities in your existing markets? Thanks. Yes, Mark. So, first of all, Turing, as you know, is the world’s first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites four different computing modes rasterization, accelerated ray-tracing, computing with CUDA, and artificial intelligence. It uses these four basic methods to create imagery for the future.
There’s two different -- two major ways that we’ll experience the benefits right-away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it’s a IKEA Catalog or movie, or architectural engineering, or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray-tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated, has been computing intensive for very long time. And it wasn’t until now that we’ve been able to achieve it in a productive way. And so, Turing has the ability to do ray-tracing, accelerated ray-tracing, and it also has the ability to combine very large frame buffers, because these data sets are extremely large.
And so, that marketplace is quite large, and it’s never been served by GPUs before, until now, all of that has been run on CPU render farms, gigantic render farms in all these movie studios and service centers and so on and so forth. The second area where you’re going to see the benefits of ray-tracing, we haven’t announced. Okay. If I could have a follow-up on the gaming side. Where do you think the industry is on creating content that leverages that kind of capability? Thank you. Yes, Mark. At GTC this last year in March -- GDC and GTC, we announced a brand new platform called NVIDIA RTX. And this platform has those four computation methods that I described, for generating images. We put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. And the major game engine companies, Epic has implemented real-time ray-tracing and the RTX into, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated for the very first time on four Volta GPUs, on four Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of - to get this platform out to all of the game developers. And we’ve been working with game developers throughout this time.
This week, at SIGGRAPH, we announced our Quadro, which is the first -- the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000, the world’s first accelerated ray-tracing GPUs. And I demonstrated one Quadro running the same application that we demonstrated on four Volta GPUsrunning in March. And the performance is really spectacular.
And so, I think the answer to your question is, developers all have access to RTX. It’s in Microsoft’s DirectX; it’s in the most popular game engine in the world; and you’re going to start to see developers use it.
On the workstation side, on the Professional Visualization side, all of the major ISVs have jumped on to adopt it. And at SIGGRAPH this year there, there you could see a whole bunch of developers demonstrating the NVIDIA RTX with accelerated ray-tracing, generating full realistic images. And so, I would say that no platform, in our history, has on day one of announcement, had so many developers jump onto it. And stay tuned. We’ve got a lot more stories to tell you about RTX. Your next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Thank you very much. Colette, I had a couple of questions about inventory, the first of which is, I understand you’ve launched a new product set in ProViz, and the Datacenter business is obviously ramping really strongly. But, if you look at the balance sheet, I think the inventory level is up by mid-30% sequentially and you’re guiding revenue up 3% or so. Maybe you could help us sort of walk through the contributions of that inventory and what it might mean for future products? And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the gaming channel, in terms of inventory, how things are looking in the channel, as you guys see it, during this period of product transition? Thank you. Sure. Thanks for your questions. So, when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet, I think it’s generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market. Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So, I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don’t forget, our work in terms of Datacenter and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer in some cases in terms of what we have also in terms of there. So, just those things together, plus our Pascal architecture is still here, makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory. Matt, on the channel inventory side, we see inventory in the lower end of our stack. And that inventory is well-positioned for back-to-school and the building season that’s coming up on Q3. And so, I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so, I think the rest of the announcements we haven’t made, but stay tuned. The RTX family is going to be a real game-changer for us. And the reinvention of computer graphics altogether has been embraced by so many developers. We’re going to see some really exciting stuff this year. Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Actually, just a clarification, and then the question. On the clarification, Colette if you could also help us understand the gross margin sequencing from Q2 to Q3? And then, Jensen, how would you contrast the Pascal cycle with the Turing cycle? Because, I think in your remarks, you mentioned Turing is a very strong advancement over what you had before. But, when you launched Pascal, you had guided to very strong Q3s and then Q4s. This time, the Q3 outlook, even though it’s good on an absolute basis, on a sequential and a relative basis, it’s perhaps not as strong. So, could you just help us contrast the Pascal cycle with what we should expect with the Turing cycle? Let me start first with your question regarding gross margins. We have essentially reached, as we move into Q3, normalization of our gross margins. I believe, over the last several quarters, we have seen the impact of crypto and what that can do to elevate our overall gross margins. We believe we’ve reached a normal period, as we’re looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we move forward. Let’s see. Pascal was really successful. Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact, and it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading. They were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient, I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy efficient than Maxwell. And that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic.
There’s just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics; it is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world; it’s the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like areal lights and global illumination and indirect lighting. The images are going to be so subtle and so beautiful, when you look at it, it just looks like a movie. And yet it’s backwards compatible, with everything that we’ve done. This new hybrid rendering model which extends what we’ve built before but added to it two new capabilities artificial intelligence and accelerated ray-tracing is just fantastic. So, everything of the past will be brought along and benefits, and it’s going to create new visuals that weren’t possible before.
We also did a good job on laying the foundations of the development platform for the developers. We partnered with Microsoft to create DXR, Vulkan RT is also coming, and we have OptiX that are used by ProViz renderers and developers all over the world. And so, we have the benefit of laying the foundation stack by stack by stack over the years. And as result, on the data that Turing comes out, we’re going to have a richness of applications that gamers will be able to enjoy.
You mentioned guidance. I actually think that on a year-over-year performance, we’re doing terrific. And I’m super excited about the ramp of Turing. It is the case that we benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto. In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of year. But, at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so, that makes comparisons on a sequential basis -- on a I guess, quarterly sequential basis harder. But, on a year-to-year basis, I think we’re doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing, high-performance computing of course, Datacenters is growing. AI, the adoption continues to seep from one industry to another industry. The automation that’s going to be brought about by AI, is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody has ever seen before. And now with Turing, we’re going to be able to reignite the Professional Visualization business, open us up to photorealistic rendering for the very first time, render farms, and everybody who is designing products that has to visualize it photo realistically to reinventing and resetting graphics for video games. And so, I think we’re in a great position, and I’m looking forward to reporting Q3, when the time comes. Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Colette, I have a question on Datacenter. In your prepared remarks, you talked about AI and high-performance computing driving new verticals, and some of these verticals are fastest growing. Some of your peers have talked about enterprise spending slowing down in the back half of this year on sever unit demand, and you guys are not -- units play more of an AI adoption. Just curious in terms of your thinking about second half Datacenter growth. So, as you know, we generally give our view on guidance for one quarter out. You are correct that our Datacenter results that we see is always a tremendous, unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we’re seeing. But, there’s still some underlying points of that that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry-by-industry coming on-board, essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential. So, we still expect as we go into Q3 for Datacenter to grow, both sequentially and year-over-year. And we’ll see probably a mix of both, selling our Tesla V100 platforms, but also a good contribution from DGX. Yes. That’s right. Atif, let me just add a little bit more to that. I think, the one simple way to think about that is this. In the transportation industry, let’s take one particular vertical, there are two dynamics that are happening that are very, very abundantly clear, and that will double -- transform that industry. The first of course is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms in order to make a recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, which customer, is a really large computing problem. It’s a machine learning problem; it’s an optimization problem at very, very large scale. And in every -- in each and every one of those instances, you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match, or the most optimal match.
The second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that’s working on robot taxis or self-driving cars, needs to collect data, label data, train on your network, or train a whole bunch of on your networks, and run those neural networks and cars. And so, you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars. And every single one of them will need even more GPU accelerated servers. And that’s just for developing the model. The next stage is to simulate the entire software because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year. And the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles. And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress, stress test our software stack. And the only way to do that is to do in virtual reality. And so, that’s another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software across those billions and billions of virtually created challenging miles.
And then lastly, before you OTA, the software, you’re going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you’ve collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars. And so, transportation is going to be a very large industry.
Healthcare is the same way, from medical imaging that is now using AI just about everywhere to genomics that has discovered deep learning and the benefits of artificial intelligence, and in the future pathology. The list goes on. And so, industry after industry after industry, we’re discovering the benefits of deep learning, and the industries could be really, really revolutionized by them. Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess, short-term and a long term. So, for short-term, as you think about your gaming guide, are you embedding any drawdown of channel inventory there? And then, longer term, as you think about Turing Tensor Cores? Can you talk a bit about differentiation versus Volta V100, particularly as you think about 8-bit integer and the opportunities there for inferencing? Thank you. We’re expecting the channel inventory to work itself out. We are masters at managing our channel, and we understand the channel very well. As you know, the way that we go to market is through the channels around the world. We’re not concerned about the channel inventory.
As we ramp Turing, whenever we ramp a new architecture, we ramp it from the top down. And so, we have plenty of opportunities as we go back to the back to school in the gaming cycle to manage the inventory. So, we feel pretty good about that.
As a result, comparing Volta andTuring, entering, CUDA iscompatible, that’s one of the benefits of CUDA. CUDA, all of the applications that take advantage of CUDA are written on top of cuDNN, which is our network platform to TensorRT that takes advantage -- that takes the output of the frameworks and optimize it for runtime. All of those tools and libraries run on top of Voltaand run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal. What Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Corethat is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large scale training. Eight GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories. And it’s designed for datacenter applications, has 64-bit double-precision, ECC, high-resilience computing, and all of the software and system software capability and tools that make Voltathe perfect high-performance computing accelerator.
In the case of Turing, it’s really designed for three major applications. The first application is to open up Pro Visualization, which is a really large market that has historically used render farms. And we’re really unable to use GPUs until we now have -- we now have the ability to do full path trace, global illumination with very, very large data sets. So, that’s one market that’s brand new as a result of Turing. The second market is to reinvent computer graphics, real time computer graphics for video games and other real time visualization applications. When you see the images created by Turing, you’re going to have a really hard time wanting to see the images of the past. It just looks amazing.
And then the third, Turing has a really supercharged Tensor Core. And this Tensor Core is used for image generation. It’s also used for high throughput, deep learning inferencing for data centers. And so, these applications for Turing would suggest that there are multiple SKUs of Turing, which is one of the reasons why we have such a great engineering team, we could scale one architecture across a whole lot of platforms at one time.
And so, I hope that answers your question that the Tensor Core inference capability of Turing is going to be off the charts. Next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about cryptocurrency. Now that the dust is settled, you guys have done a good job of kind of laying out exactly how much of the OEM business has been driven by that but there’s also been I think some sense of -- some of the GeForce business was being driven by crypto. Can you -- looking backwards, can you size that for us? And I guess if -- I am trying to understand the impact the crypto would have on the guidance for October, given that it seems it was very small in the July quarter? Well, I think the second question is easier to answer and the reason -- the first one is just ambiguous. It’s hard to predict, anyway. It’s hard to estimate, no matter what. But, the second question, the answer is we’re expecting -- we’re projecting zero basically. And for the first question, how much of GeForce could’ve been used for crypto? A lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they’re sleeping, they could do some mining. And so, do they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it’s kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped on to the market to buy it from retail, and that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from late Q3, Q4, Q1, and very little last quarter, and we’re projecting no crypto-mining going forward. Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had one for Jensen and one for Colette. Jensen, I was hoping you could remind us how meaningful your inference business is today within Datacenter, and how would you expect growth to come about over the next two years, as you -- as your success at accounts like Google proliferate across a broader set of customers? And then, for Colette, if you can give directional guidance for each of your platforms. I know you talked about Datacenter a little bit, if you can talk about the other segments. And on gaming specifically, if you can talk about whether or not new products are embedded in that guide? Inference is going to be a very large market for us. It is surely material now in our Datacenter business. It is not the largest segment, but I believe it’s going to be a very large segment of our Datacenter business. There’re 30 million servers around the world, and that’s kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated. And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence and deep learning software and neural net models are going to prediction models, are going to be infused into software everywhere. And acceleration has proven to be the best approach going forward.
We’ve been laying the foundations for inferencing for a couple or two, three years. And as we have described at GTCs, inference is really, really complicated. And the reason for that is you have to take the output of these massive, massive networks that are output of the training frameworks and optimize it. This is probably the largest computational graph optimization problem that world has ever seen. And this is brand-new invention territory. There are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs, to auto encoders to RNNs and LSTMs, there is just so many different species of neural networks these days and is continuing to grow. And so the compiler technology is really, really complicated.
And this year, we announced two things. Earlier this year, we announced that we’ve been successful in taking the Tesla P4, low-profile, high-energy-efficiency inference accelerator into hyperscale datacenters. And we announced our fourth generation TensorRT optimizing compiler, neural network optimizing compiler. And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning, and now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from internet services all over the world. And so, now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it. We are actively working with just about every single internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack. And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and very importantly, the need low latency. Voice recognition is only useful if it response in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that.
And then, this last week, this week we announced Turing. And I announced that the inference performance of Turing is 10 times the inference performance of Pascal, which is already a couple of hundred times the inference performance of CPUs. And so, you take a look at the rate at which we’re moving on, both in the support of new neural networks, the ever-increasing optimization and performance output of the compilers, and the rate at which we’re advancing our processors, I think we’re raising the bar pretty high. Okay. So, with that, Colette? So, when you look at our overall segments, as you’ve even seen our results in terms of this last Q2, there is growth across every single one of our platforms from a year-over-year standpoint. We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year, again just due to absence of those cryptocurrency in our forecast. When we think about sequentially, our hopes is absolutely our Datacenter will grow and will likely see the growth of our Gaming business as well. It’s still early, still we’ve got many different scenarios on our ProViz and Auto. But definitely our Gaming and our Datacenter are expected to grow sequentially. Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Two on gross margin. Colette, I just want to make sure I understood July to October gross margins down. I know you’ve been getting a benefit from crypto but it was pretty de minimis in July. So, is there any other than pieces? And then, kind of longer picture here, how do you think about the ramp of Turing affecting gross margins? You’re obviously enabling a lot of capabilities to get paid for it, 12 nanometers, fairly stable. And just kind of curious how to think about over the couple of quarters gross margin with that ramp? Yes. So, let me take your first part of the question regarding our gross margins and what we have
seen from crypto. Although crypto revenue may not be large, it still has a derivative impact on our stack in terms of what we are selling and to both replenish the overall channel and such. So, over the last several quarters, that we had stabilizing that overall channel, we did get the great effect of selling just about everything and our margins really been able to benefit from that. Again, when we look at the overall growth year-over-year for Q2, you have 500 basis points in terms of growth. We’re excited about what we have now here for Q3 as well, which is also significant growth year-over-year. Of course, we have our high value added platforms as we move forward, both -- those in Datacenter, those in terms of what we expect the effects of Turing in terms of on our Quadro piece as well. But that will take some time for that all to partake. So, we’ll see how that goes. We haven’t announced anything further at this time. But, yes, we’ll see probably over the longer term, the effects of Turing can do. Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. I’m curious, as we look at the data center business, if you can help us understand the breakdown of demand between hyperscale, the supercomputing piece of the business, and the AI piece. And I guess on top of that, I’m just curious, one of the metrics that’s pretty remarkable over the last couple quarters is you’ve seen significant growth in China. I’m curious, if that’s related to the Datacenter business or what’s really driving that, as kind of a follow-up question. Thank you. Yes, Aaron. I think, that if you look at the -- if you start from first principles, here’s the simple way to look at it. Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every five years. 10x every five years is approximately Moore’s Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every five years. However, Moore’s Law stopped. And so, that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way. And NVIDIA’s videos GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered, really stands to benefit from that.
And so, at the highest level, whether it’s supercomputing, and this year -- you heard Collette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56% of all the new performance that came into the world’s TOP500. The TOP500 is called the TOP500, because it reflects the future of computing. And my expectation is that more and more from one vertical industry after another, and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned healthcare, the vertical industries go on and on, that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every five years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA’s GPU computing to boost their demand. I think that’s probably the best way to answer it. Your next question is from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about cloud and hyperscale, we tend to think about the top guys right there, designing their own platforms, using your Tesla-based products or sometimes even designing their own chips for AI and deep learning. But, there’s a larger base of medium to smaller cloud and hyperscale customers out there who don’t have R&D scale. And I think that’s where your HGX platform seems to be focused on. So, Jensen, can you just give us an update on the uptake of your first generation HGX-1 reference platform and the initial interest on HGX-2? Thanks. HGX-1 was I guess kind of the prototype of HGX-2. HGX-2 is doing incredibly well, and for all the reasons that you mentioned. It is an even the largest hyperscale data centers can’t afford to create these really complicated motherboards at the scale that we’re talking about. And so, we created HGX-2, and it was immediately adopted by several most important hyperscalers in the world. And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So, we’re in the process of finishing HGX-2 and ramping into production. And so, I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. We could use it for essentially a standard motherboard, like the ATX motherboard for PCs that could be used for hyper scalars, it could be used for HPC, it could be used for datacenters, and it’s a really fantastic design. It just allows people to adopt this really complicated and high-performance and really high-speed interconnect motherboard in a really easy way. Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Thank you. Actually, I had two questions, Jensen, both for you. First, now that Crypto has fallen off, I’m curious what you think the potential is that maybe we see a slug of cards that get resold on eBay or some other channel and that could cannibalize new Pascal sales. Is that something that keeps you up at night? Number one. And number two, obviously, the stories about Gaming and Datacenter. And I know that you don’t typically talk about customers. But, since Tesla did talk about you on their call, I’m curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your DRIVE platform? Thank you. Sure. Well, the Crypto mining market is very different today than it was three years ago. And even though, new cards -- at the current prices, it doesn’t make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market. The existing capacity is still being used. And you can see the hash rates continue. And so, my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards. And then, probably the more important factor though is that that we’re in the process of announcing a brand new way of doing computer graphics. And with Turing and our RTX platform, computer graphics will never be the same. And so, I think there’s -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to great.
I also think that -- I appreciate Elon’s comments about our Company, and I also think Tesla makes great cars, and I drive them very happily. And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used a three-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower. In order to have a safe computing -- in order to have safe driving, the algorithms have to be rich and has to be able to handle corner conditions in a lot of diverse situations. And every time that there’s more and more corner conditions or more subtle things that you have to do or you have to drive more smoothly or be able to take turns more quickly, all of those -- all of those requirements require greater computing capability. And that’s exactly the reason why we built Xavier. Xavier is in production now. We’re seeing great success and customers are super excited about Xavier. And that’s exactly the reason why we’ve built it. And I think a super-hard to build a Xavier and all the software stack on top of it. And if it doesn’t turn out for whatever reasons, it doesn’t turn out for them, they can give me a call, and I’d be more than happy to help. And unfortunately we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks. We had a great quarter. Our core platforms exceeded expectations, even as crypto largely disappeared. Each of our platforms AI, Gaming, ProViz and self driving cars continued to enjoy great adoption. These markets are -- we are enabling are some of the most impactful to world -- to the world today. We launched Turing this week. It was 10 years in the making and completes the NVIDIA RTX platform. NVIDIA RTX with Turing is the greatest advance since CUDA, nearly a decade ago. I’m incredibly proud of our Company for tackling this incredible challenge, reinventing the entire graphic stack, and giving the industry a surge of excitement as we reinvent computer graphics. Stay tuned as we unfold the exciting RTX story. See you guys next time. Thank you for joining.

I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until November 22, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize.
Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal [segment] [ph] to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcement. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.
GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter.
From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.
Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.
The first two GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These two high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce 27D. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.
Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.
Moving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for both the architecture products, including Tesla V100 and DGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.
We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes two critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.
Completing our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the TensorRT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyperscale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market, targeting every server node in the hyperscale data centers.
Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture, which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000. With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPOs, photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload. So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs. An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance of CPU render farm is 1/4 the cost, 1/10 the space and 1/11 the power. NVIDIA's RTX platform has garnered major industry support, including from key developers such as Adobe, ANSYS, Autodesk, Dassault and many others.
Lastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest high-performance computing applications not to have been accelerated. Virtually all enterprise use data analytics to extract insight from big data for a wide range of use cases, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. RAPIDS is an open source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. With RAPIDS, NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning, as we have done with deep learning, with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs. The RAPIDS launch opens up a $20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs, and it's received broad industry support, including from Oracle, IBM, SAP, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure machine learning, Google, Q-Flow as well as the open source community.
With one unified architecture and ecosystem, NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market, including scientific computing, deep learning and machine learning. Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads, ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers. Just earlier this week, this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas, where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48% from last year, including the #1 and #2 systems in the world.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached a record $305 million, up 28% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Strength extended across the desktop and mobile as well as several key industries, including the public sector, manufacturing and architecture, engineering and construction.
At SIGGRAPH in August, we announced our Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture. And earlier this week, we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000, the most advanced professional GPU priced under $1,000. These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows. The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3, with the server-grade, high-end products recognized in data center. We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX, including the major movie studios and game developers, and the reaction has been very positive.
Finally, turning to automotive. Automotive sales in Q3 reached $172 million, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation, AI-based cockpit infotainment systems.
At GTC Europe, we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars. The initial production release slated for the early 2020s will deliver Level 2+ assisted driving features, integrating 360-degree surround perception and a driver monitoring system. This is our first Level 2 mass-market car design win. In addition to Volvo, global automotive suppliers, Continental and Veoneer, announced that they have selected NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for their autonomous driving systems. Lastly, our DRIVE AGX Xavier development kit started shipping in this quarter. This is the world's first autonomous driving platform, and it can run our NVIDIA DRIVE software for autonomous driving, including data collection, 360-degree surround perception, advanced driver monitoring and in-vehicle visualization. With this platform, customers have developed and test their autonomous driving solutions and then easily move into production. We are excited about the AV opportunity as we look into next year and beyond.
Moving to the rest of the P&L and the balance sheet. Q3 gross margins was 60.4% and non-GAAP was 61%, below our outlook due to the $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff in crypto demand. GAAP operating expenses were $863 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million, up 28% year-on-year. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, data center and automotive.
GAAP net income was $1.23 billion, and EPS was $1.97, up 48% from a year earlier. GAAP net income benefited from the reduction of $138 million in our U.S. tax reform transition tax amount as well as other discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net income was $1.15 billion and EPS was $1.84, up 38% from a year ago, reflecting revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as lower income tax expense.
Accounts receivable was $2.22 billion compared to $1.66 billion in the prior quarter as Turing's RTX shipments began in the latter part of the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.42 billion compared to $1.09 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the ramp in production of Turing products.
Quarterly cash flow from operations was $487 million. Capital expenditures were $150 million. This fiscal year, we have returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through the end of Q3. We've announced a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 effective in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are also pleased to announce an increase of $7 billion to our share repurchase authorization and that we intend to return an additional $3 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As noted earlier, our revenue outlook is impacted by the expected work-down of Pascal midrange gaming card inventory in the channel. In addition, we expect a decline in our gaming console revenue given seasonal build patterns. Keep in mind that the midrange desktop portfolio is typically about 1/3 of our gaming business. Our outlook assumes that channel inventory weeks approach normal levels exiting Q4 and that gaming and demand increases in Q4 compared with Q3.
Now in total, we expect revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.3% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $915 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $21 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, I'd like to highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6, and we will be meeting with the financial community at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 8 through 11. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 will take place on February 14.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Within your guidance for the January quarter, is the team anticipating continued sequential growth in your data center business? There seems to be some concern around the near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we're hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter. Yes, we expect to continue to do well in data centers. The -- if you look at the background of what's happening, we know that Moore's Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computational and really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren't getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore's Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic.
The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there's a lot of domain expertise, where there's -- whether it's in retail or whether it's in financial services or health care, logistics, there's a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore's Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well. Great. And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products? Yes, the Turing launch happened towards the end of the quarter, and it's the biggest generational leap we've ever had. It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It's the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it's the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world's first application to support real-time ray-tracing. So I -- we expect Turing to do really well. As we go on, surely, we'll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. And so we don't have anything to announce today, but as usual, we want to bring a brand-new architecture to as many gamers as possible. Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had a question on the gaming outlook and as it relates to channel inventory. Colette, you mentioned that typically, the midrange is about 1/3 of gaming. How much was it in the October quarter? And are you effectively assuming close to 0 in the January quarter? And related to that, I think with your game console business, I'm estimating you did something around $200 million to $250 million in October. Again, is that coming down pretty hard into January? Yes. So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1/3 consistently over, let's say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters. What we're seeing is just a normal where they build ahead of the holidays in Q3, and that slows down as we move into Q4 when we're in the middle of the holidays. Great. And then as a follow-up, you saw nice acceleration in growth in your ProVis business this quarter. Jen-Hsun, I think you've talked extensively about the RTX and the long-term opportunity there. What are your expectations going into 2019 for that segment? I expect ProVis to grow. The ProVis platform, more -- there's more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it's not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it's been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change. And so RTX is the first one. So I'm expecting ProVis to do really well. Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch. I'm curious, Jen-Hsun, what needs to happen to work down this midrange Pascal inventory? Is it pricing? Is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter, but it hasn't. Do you think people were waiting for Turing to come out and maybe that created some kind of pause? And then as part of -- part B of that question, maybe Colette, how should we think about seasonality in the April quarter given that you mentioned it could take 1 or 2 quarters to work down this inventory? Yes, well, we came into Q3 with excess channel inventory post the crypto hangover. We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline and decline slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I'm hoping that -- I'm hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it's at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell anymore into the channel for the upcoming quarter to get the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has. And so we'll keep our eyes on it, but our expectation is that inventory levels will come back to normal by the end of the quarter. Okay. Vivek, to answer your question also regarding Q1 in terms of what we're going to see in terms of the expectation, as the channel inventory normalizes at the end of Q4, we do believe going into Q1, we will be probably up from where we end in terms of Q4. So we won't follow that normal seasonality between Q1 and Q4. We do expect to be up as we go into Q1. You have a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. I guess, a follow-up question on the channel inventory side. It looks like it's roughly $600 million kind of a drawdown here. And just curious, does that sound right? Number one. Number two, does that fit with what you are hearing from your channel partners in terms of what's excess? And then as part of that, are you drawing down inventory in the current quarter ahead of Turing architecture launch into the mainstream? The last question, I'm not sure I understand. The -- I think the answer to your first question is yes. You framed it nicely. It's -- the answer is yes. The last question was what again? The last question was regarding our midrange. Is there any statement about future Turing products that were taken into account? Yes, we haven't announced our future Turing product, but it would be expected for us to create a Turing GPU that serves the mainstream parts of the marketplace. And so we're not announcing anything, but it would be conventional of us to do that. I guess, the question was whether you were drawing down inventory perhaps below normalized levels in the current quarter. No, we're really not shipping into the midrange segment of Pascal so that we get the channel an opportunity to sell through the product that has. And we would like to see channel inventory get normalized by the end of Q4, and then we'll get back to doing our work. Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. My first one is for Colette. I just wanted to be a little more explicit. If I think about your business split into sort of gaming and non-gaming, are you looking for the non-gaming pieces in aggregate to grow sequentially into Q4? Stacy, yes. I think the answer to that is yes. In aggregate, yes, we do believe the rest of the business will grow sequentially. Got it. I guess that fits with the kind of 1/3 you're talking because that implies the gaming down 30%-plus. So that is what your kind of a magnitude that you're thinking about at this point. That is correct. Got it. For my second question, I just wanted to -- for the last several quarters, the idea that the channel could be getting full is not necessarily a new worry. And yet the last several quarters, you've been saying, like on this call, that you guys felt like you had a really good handle on the channel, and yet it seems like maybe that wasn't exactly the case. Can you give us a feeling, maybe a better feeling for what changed and when you saw it in the quarter? Was this something that happened kind of like late in the quarter that you realized it? Or did you go into the quarter knowing that the inventories were high and needed to be corrected? Like what happened? Because this tone is a little different from what we've heard over the last few earnings calls from you. Let's see. We were surprised, obviously. I mean, we're surprised by it, as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we're going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that. And so that's -- the first one is that we -- just we didn't expect it either and we didn't realize the magnitude of it until towards the end of the quarter. What was the other question? Was there another question? I think that, that was it. Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. With regards to Turing ramp, I guess, how is that going relative to your expectations? It seems like availability is quite a bit better now. And where do you stand with DLSS support? I know you've announced a number of games that will have DLSS support by year-end. Like how many of those are already supporting that technology? Yes, the ramp is going great, and I think this is the biggest generational leap we've ever had. This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It's never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it's still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. And so at every single graphics -- every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. So it is unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world and then -- and of course, all of these great new features will be coming. Your next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. I'm still trying to put my head around the magnitude of this channel inventory drawdown because if you don't ship like the midrange cards for a full quarter, that means your inventory today is more than a quarter, more than 12 weeks of sales. And so my first question would be, am I right thinking that? Are you available a full quarter of sales in inventories? And then my second question is while you are bringing down these inventories, I would have expected to see, like, the Turing high-end card, the 2080 and the 2080 Ti ramping in Q4. And it looks like, excluding the inventory, the rest of the business -- the rest of the GPU business in gaming would be more like flattish sequentially. I'm trying to figure out what the first part of the question was. The first question was whether the midrange of Pascal had more than 12 weeks of inventory, if it's going to take more than a quarter to bring it down. I think the channel has more than 12 weeks of inventory between us and the other brand. One of the things that is hard to estimate is how much inventory the other brands have. And our quarter is 1 month later. And so whatever action we take, whatever we see in the channel is 1 month after their end of the quarter. The amount of inventory is not just us. It's also the other brands. And our ability to see the other brand's inventory is just much harder. We try our best to estimate it, but obviously, we didn't estimate it well enough. And so the answer to your question is yes, I think there's about -- from our perspective, about 12 weeks of our inventory to sell through at this point. Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. I was hoping you could contrast this product cycle transition to Turing to the product transition you had to Pascal. And is the only -- or is the main difference the crypto hangover? Is there something else impacting the transition, do you think? I mean, you've described Turing as the greatest generational leap, and I'm wondering if that larger delta has an impact to the transition as well. Turing is the highest performance GPU at every single price point. And so it played no role in its transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. It's -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we're talking about. And we really didn't see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there's a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter's time, we'll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can't exactly sure what we would have done different. But between the unexpected, unanticipated slow decline of pricing in the channel and even after the prices came down, it took a little longer than we expected for volume to kick up. And the other brand's inventory in the marketplace, those factors kind of compounded and made it a lot worse than we expected. You have a question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently on the gaming business. If I look back over the past several quarters, let's say you've been running at roughly a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion revenue level since the October '17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We look like we're now going back to that level. I guess, the question is, do we build off of that level? Do we bring back half of the inventory burn? How do I think about the return of year-over-year growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020? And then a quick second question. Over the past few years, you've had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business, in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I'm just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter? Okay. Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's Law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We're the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. And then this quarter, we announced three new initiatives that's going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which is -- as we know, is on the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is. The second is the ability to do rendering fulfillment, photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand-new cloud GPU, we call T4, that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It's just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we'll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great. Back to your question about gaming. So the statement came in regarding -- you've bumped up the overall gaming somewhere in mid of the year to about a $1.7 billion gaming business, where maybe if you look back 2 years, you were at about $1.1 billion. At this stage, when you come out of the setback that we have here to get through the overall channel inventory, where will you come out after that? And what type of growth could we expect? Yes, I'm going to let you guys do the modeling, but let me just take those. There's nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize that it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down, started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that's what we're experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects. But there's nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that's fundamentally different. Yes. To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing. In terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange, but overall, as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well. Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. And perhaps I don't know if it's a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude for how the ramp goes? The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or the models on top of T4. And so we're working hard on that.
And when that happens, it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy, and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned. And I look forward to coming back and telling you guys about success. You have a question from Will Stein with SunTrust. First, Jen-Hsun, I appreciate all the details on the T4 for inference in the data center. Could you likewise highlight the current traction you're seeing and the long-term growth expectations for the Jetson product that's designed for really, I think, a different market? It's inference at the edge, right? Yes, Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is a functional save, high-performance with a lot of complicated software, one version of that, you could say, is self-driving cars. And this quarter, we announced winning our first mass-market Level 2. We've been really successful in robot taxis and Level 4s and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems, where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of LiDARs and surround cameras requires a lot of computation and -- but we've never been successful until now. We're taking the DRIVE platform all the way down to Level 2 mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I'm expecting many more. And I think we've positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver Level 2 capability in a single chip for the very first time. And Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip, autonomous vehicle processor in production today. Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots. It could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, and autonomous warehouses. So -- or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that, in the device itself, recognizes and identifies anomalies. And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI, and that's the reason why we built Jetson. Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. I'll ask a clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the inventory issue, and thanks for all the color. But one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s and then Ti flavors still selling? And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? And then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year. Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it's one of the best quarter we've ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers' hands all over the world. The area where I'm super excited about right now are the three that I've mentioned that we've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of
Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore's Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let's call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic.
And so that's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple -- 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us. The answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers. Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. To sum up, the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess inventory -- excess channel inventory. It will take 1 or 2 quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and doesn't change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore's Law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up 3 exciting markets for us with ray-tracing games, film rendering and hyperscale inference. And with our first win in mainstream Level 2 self-driving cars with Volvo, our DRIVE AV platform is gearing up for the mass market, and our competitive position has never been stronger. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you. Thank you for joining.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. As you know we lowered fourth quarter guidance for January 28th and the results are in line with our pre-announcement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from the previous year.
Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $954 million was down 45% year-on-year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full year revenue was up 13% to $6.25 billion. Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through. We expect channel inventory to normalize in Q1 in line with one to two quarter timeline we had outlined on our previous earnings call.
Second, deteriorating macro economic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs; and third, sales of certain high end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real time ray-tracing and AI, but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for lower price points or further demonstrations of the RTX technology and actual gains. The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model.
Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line. Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the long live business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products. To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across the period that doesn't include crypto demand.
Let's look at the four quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 of this year. In Q2 and Q3 of last year with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4 and will do so again in Q1. Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these four quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over these same four quarters, such in total we believe are normalized [indiscernible] gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion.
As we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming. At CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business. We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the mid range price point of [$349] [ph]. The 2060 delivers a 60% performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing's real time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time. The 2060 has received rave reviews and is off to a great start.
In addition, we announced a record of 40 plus new Turing based gaming laptops, which became available on January 29th.This is more than double the number of GeForce powered notebooks in the market last year. Featuring the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture [indiscernible] the laptops are able to deliver the performance of desktop gaming PCs. We expect GeForce laptops to continue to be the fastest growing segment of gaming.
We're also pleased to see growing momentum in the RTX ecosystem. As more game developers are creating content to take advantage of the Turing architectures' amazing capabilities. Just this week, DLSS technology is becoming available in two blockbuster games, Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus, and Anthem coming soon. In addition at CES, Justice and Atomic Heart showed demos featuring ray tracing and DLSS, and the large pipelines of games plan to integrate RTX technology.
Pairing DLSS with ray tracing can provide comparable frame rates to traditional restorization but also much more beautiful cinematic visual, the best of both worlds. This is the next generation of gaming. While this was a challenging quarter in our gaming business we look forward to putting the channel inventory correction behind us and building on the solid foundation of our Turing architecture.
Moving to data center. Revenue was $679 million, up 12% year-on-year and down 14% sequentially. Full year data center revenue was $2.93 billion, up a strong 52%. The Q4 sales decline was broad based across verticals and markets and geographies. As the quarter progressed, customers around the world became increasingly cautious due to rising economic uncertainty and the number of deals did not close in January.
In addition, hyperscale and cloud purchases declined both sequentially and year-on-year as several customers paused at the end of the year. We believe the pause is temporary. The strength of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform remains intact. We continue to lead the industry in performance for scientific computing and deep learning. And with CUDA's programability, we can continue to expand the value of our platform.
For example, we recently announced RAPIDS, our CUDA acceleration stack for data analytics and machine learning. In December, the first objective third-party AI benchmark called MLPerf became available. And NVIDIA captured the top spots in the six test categories for training deep learning models that we competed in. And in January, Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs are now available in beta in its data centers in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, India, Singapore and Tokyo. The T4 is a universal cloud GPU that accelerates a variety of workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, broader machine learning, data analytics and graphics.
Our visibility remains low in the current cautious spending environment, and we don't forecast a meaningful recovery in the data center segment until later in the year. However, we are working closely with hyperscales around the world to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT software and Tensor Core GPUs into their inference production flow. Inference currently drives less than 10% of our data center business, while represents a significant expansion of our addressable market opportunity going forward.
We have also strengthened our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities to address vertical industries that have an enormous data and analytics requirement, such as automotive, financial services, retail, healthcare and consumer Internet services. With our RAPIDS software stack, NVIDIA can accelerate data analytics and machine learning and as we have done in deep learning. And we made it easier for customers to adopt our technology by partnering with Cisco, IBM, NetApp and Pure Storage to create pre-integrated systems that can be sold through their global IT channels.
Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $293 million, up 15% from the prior year and down 4% sequentially. Full year revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% year-on-year. New applications like data science, AI and VR, as well as the need for thin and light mobile workstations remain key growth drivers for the business. We had key wins in the quarter, including Boeing, Google, LinkedIn and Toyota for applications including AI and robotics. This past week with our partners HP, Dell, Lenovo, we announced the availability of Quadro RTX workstation. Quadro RTX is the most significant workstation GPU upgrade in 10 years. It will enable millions of designers and creative artists for the first time to work interactively with super high resolution media and photorealistic 3D rendering, enabling them to be creative with dramatically improved productivity.
Finally, turning to automotive. Q4 revenue was $163 million, up 23% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. Full year revenue reached $641 million, up 15%. The sequential decline was largely seasonal. The year-on-year growth was driven by the increasingly adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals, partially offset by declines in legacy infotainment. Last month at CES, we announced DRIVE AutoPilot, the world's first commercially available level two plus self driving car computer. This system offers sophisticated automated driving features that far surpassed today's ADAS offerings, increasing the vehicles' performance, functionality and road safety, while the driver remains in control.
To deliver these capabilities, DRIVE AutoPilot uses multiple deep neural networks surround camera perception both in and outside of the car and significant AI processing capability. Systems from our Tier 1 partners, including Bosch, Continental, Veoneer, and ZF were all on-display at our booths. Although, as announced back in October, it was our first level two plus design win with cars slated for production in the early 2020s.
Mercedes-Benz has also chosen NVIDIA for its next generation autonomous vehicle and cockpit computer. This centralized AI computing system replaces dozens of smaller processors inside current cars. DRIVE AutoPilot is a major milestone for NVIDIA, and takes our high functioning self-driving capabilities into the mass market. This will be an important year for robo-taxi pilots and initial level two design wins.
Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 54.7% and non-GAAP was 56%, down sequentially and year-on-year, primarily due to $128 million charge for DRAM [port] and other components associated with our lower than expected Q4 revenue and current market conditions. GAAP operating expenses were $913 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $755 million, up 25% and 24% year-on-year respectively. The GAAP EPS was $0.92, down 48% from a year earlier. Full year GAAP EPS was $6.63, up 38% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 53% from a year ago. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $6.64, up 35% from the prior year. We returned $1.95 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. As we announced last quarter, we plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and buybacks. We repurchased $700 million during the fourth quarter fiscal 2019.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020; we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion plus or minus 2%; GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.8% and 59% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points; GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $930 million and $755 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an income of $20 million; GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items; capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million.
For fiscal 2020, we expect Q1 to mark the bottom as we passed the inventory correction in gaming. We expect total revenue for the year to be flat to down slightly with growth in our four end markets, compensating for the absence of crypto revenue and the excess selling for most year. We plan to grow OpEx in the high single digits this year, and we continue to invest in our focus growth areas of graphics, AI and self-driving cars. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information is available on our IR Web site.
In closing, I'd like to highlight upcoming events for the financial community; we will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom conference on February 26; and our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the quarter of fiscal 2020 take place on May 15th.
We will now open the call for customers. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had two questions. First, Colette, you talked about the weakness you saw in the 2070 and the 2080 in the quarter. I guess this question is more for Jen-Hsun. Are you concerned at all about your ability to convince and incentivize gamer [indiscernible] as Colette pointed out, it's more of a timing thing. And the second question is inventory was up on the balance sheet. Colette, if you can just provide some color there and expectations going forward. Thank you. When we launched the 2070 and 2080, it was the first time we've ever launched a new generation where the only available SKUs were very high end. And in addition to that, the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the over clocked versions. And the MSRP versions didn't show up for some short time after, couple of months after. And so the conditions weren't ideal, if you will. We weren't able to launch into the mainstream segment with 2060 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now. And so I think that the situ wasn't ideal. When you take a look at our situation now, every single graphics card had the best performance at its price point and it remains so today.
And I think that right out of the box, it delivered excellent performance. It is true that everybody was hoping to see more games with RTX on day one. But it's such a new technology with ray-tracing and AI for image processing that it's only really possible to make available with new games, which is tied to the schedules of new games. And now they're starting to come out. Battlefield 5, Metro Exodus, I think that the reviews from this week are just spectacular, people are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about and that it's possible with RTX technology, the combination of applying ray-tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance and so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology and we just needed some time to demonstrate it and I think the takeaway is simply this RTX is the best graphics card at every single price point without using ray tracing technology and for new games that are coming out each one of the new games that come out in the future will apply ray tracing work with developers to apply ray tracing technology; I think everybody agrees that it is the surely the next generation. And then probably one of the biggest stories that came out just last week is a Unreal Engine and Unity both of the game engines are going to incorporate RTX and ray-tracing technology in the engine itself. And so all future games in the future will be able to take advantage of that, so that's a really big news and I'm excited about that. So Toshiya to answer your second question regarding our inventory balance. Our inventory dollars at the end of Q4 rose just due to the weaker than expected finish to Q4. Inventory right now is primarily related to Turing, Volta and DGX. And we don't expect any further write-downs as we have incorporated approximately 128 million of write-downs within the current Q4. Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. I guess on the commentary regarding a pause in spending in data center and a handful of deals that got delayed. Can you give a little bit more color in terms of I guess what you're seeing across enterprise cloud, high performance compute, and I guess within that, how you're seeing the ramp of T4? And I guess if you can then speak to I'm sure embedded in the fiscal '20 guidance is a pretty nice ramp into the second half. What are the key drivers, key milestones that you're looking for to see that business reaccelerate higher as we go through the year? The slowdown is broad based. We saw it across every vertical, every geography. There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we've not experienced in a while. And I think that it has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth is, it's not certainly been satisfied with what was shipped last quarter. And so I think that the demand will return and customers will return. Our situation in data centers is dramatically better year-over-year. And if you take a look at where we are, our deep learning solution is unquestionably the best in the world. We introduced T4 with inference capability, it's the world's first universal cloud GPU and it does everything that NVIDIA does, all in one GPU and 75 watts. And so it fits into every hyperscale data center.
We're engaged with Internet Service Providers all around the world, optimizing and porting their high production models networks so that we could deploy it into production. So we now have four different new growth drivers for our data center in addition to deep learning and scientific computing; we have inference that we're actively working on; we have data analytics that’s called rapids, some people call it Big Data, but data analytics and machine learning; the third is rendering. And because of the partnerships that we've developed and the excitement that people see around enterprises around the world, we've developed partnerships with large IT companies to pre-configure systems that make it easier for enterprises to be able to adopt our technology. So we have four new ways for us to grow our enterprise business. And so we're looking forward to when the pause releases and we'll get back to growing. And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I just had a clarification and a question. On the clarification, gross margins. Colette, what is the normalized run rate for gross margins? As you get to your sales back to normalized levels, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And will there be any impact from the balance sheet inventory? And then on the question Jen-Hsun, can you give us more reassurance that gaming is still a growth business? I understand that over the last year, there's been a lot of confusion, there's been macro issues. But if you look at the number of gamers and the mix of product that they are buying so essentially to sell through to gamers, has that been on an upward trajectory? And as part of that, when do you think we could see Turing exceed the demand you saw for Pascal? Thank you. On gross margin, our gross margin, the largest contributor to our absolute gross margin is really just the mix of our product. The mix of our products based on our market platforms, but also the mix of our products within data center, as well as within gaming. We provided guidance for Q1, which has a good level of confidence from us and we'll see how it goes from there. The fundamentals of gaming has not changed, there more gamers than ever. Games are better than ever. There's been a recent shift in the popularity of multiplayer competitive e-sports like games, that's good for hardware. It lowers the barrier to entry, because it's free to play with the exception of downloadable content. And so the barriers to entry is lower but you could see that the excitement around Fortnight and recently with Apex Legend, PUBG is still popular, League of Legends is still popular. And so this genre of games is both competitive, requires great hardware, it attracts a lot more players, because it's social and you want to play with your friends and it's much stickier, because it happens to be social, it happens to be a game where you have to play with a whole bunch of other people. And so I think that gaming is vibrant as ever before.
If you take the methodology that Colette described earlier and you averaged out our underlying gaming business and you compare that to a year before, surely it grew. If you compare that -- if you compare also the rate at which our gaming notebook is growing, I think that's pretty exciting. I think last year and we had mentioned it before that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year-over-year. And just at CES the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing, because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time. And so I think the dynamics are the same and gaming is going to continue to be a growth business. And your next question comes from the line and John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Colette, I appreciate all the data you gave us on trying to size normalized demand for gaming. What I have to ask though is if you’re going through channel inventory worked out in fiscal first quarter, it seems like to hit your full year guide the expectation is for gaming revenue to accelerate well above that normalized level you talked about. What am I doing the math right? And if I am, what gives you confidence throughout the year that you can see that gaming growth off of these numbers? I’ll start and I’ll let Jen-Hsun finish that question. So along the lines of Jen-Hsun's response in terms of what we do believe are the key drivers of gaming. And everything's still intact in terms of gaming, both with our Turing architecture, the growth expected with our Turing architecture, as well as the green from the notebook, we do believe will be great drivers as we head into the rest of the year. We'll have to wait and see in terms of how that plays out but that is really the underlying reason why the growth will continue. I think your math isn't wrong. The part that you probably didn't consider is notebook. Our GeForce notebook business is quite large. And then maybe as a follow-up just on the data center side. Clearly, you’ve talked about new applications that should help grow your TAM inside of data center. I’m just curious the calendar fourth quarter of last year, I think marked the first time that a competitor had some meaningful volumes in GPU in the data center. There's always talk about the [ITCM] guys wanting to do their own ASICs. What anecdotal evidence can you give us to help us get more comfortable that what’s going on here is more macro and not share loss either to competition and/or architectural differences between GPUs and ASICs? We don't see them in high performance computing. And so I haven't found where -- we haven't met them in high performance computing and deep learning, and in the areas that we serve. And so competitively, really we don't see it. But the bigger picture I think is this that the market segments that we serve, whether it's in deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, those segments are really quite large. And I think that it is unquestionably the future of high performance computing is going to be highly data driven, both computational methods, algorithmic methods, as well as data driven methods. And so I think the fundamental trend has not changed.
We have four new growth drivers, four new ways to grow in the data center. The first one of course is inference. We're making a lot of progress there, T4 is doing great. I think we're going to be quite successful with T4s. You just got to keep saying that has second generation Tensor Core, 75 watts and you can use it for training, you can use it for inference, you could use it for remote graphics, you could use it for high performance computing. And it fits literally into any hyperscale data center.
The second way is data analytics. This is a brand new thing for us. You must know that Big Data and using data to predict dynamics in the marketplaces is really important in retail and e-tail, and healthcare, and financial services. And there's never been accelerated approach to solve this problem for people. And because of the flexibility of CUDA and because the performance of architecture, over the course of last year, we reengineered the entire data analytics stack. So that we can accelerate, it's called RAPIDS. That work is really, really important and I hope to give you guys updates on that on a regular basis. Rendering is a brand new market for us, because of Turing, finally we can we can render photo realistic images in accelerated way. There are millions of servers in the world that are driving render farms and they're getting upgraded on a regular basis.
And then lastly, we've been successful with CSPs, because they're easy for us to reach. But the world's enterprises are far and many and they're giant industries. And our company's sales coverage doesn't allow us to reach every single healthcare company and every single insurance company and retail company. And that's where our network of partners really come in. We have great partnerships with HP. We have great partnerships with Dell and Cisco and IBM. And now we've developed relationships with the storage vendors. And the reason for that is because most of these big data problems require great deal of storage. And they all see -- they see the opportunities that we created. And we came together to create pre-configured systems that are optimized attuned. And these high performance systems that you can just bring into the company prop up and install, and we're seeing a lot of great success with that.
And so we have four different ways to grow our data center business and we're enthusiastic about it. I'm optimistic about it. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. First, I had a clarification. Colette, I just wanted to clarify what the mix is assumed for the fiscal Q1 guidance. So you assuming that data center and gaming are both flat sequentially. And then I guess my question was. Can you help us shape the revenue through the year? To get to your full year guidance, you have to add roughly, maybe $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion from where you are in fiscal Q1. How does that shape through the year? Thanks. Our guidance for the next quarter is a make-up of many different types of options across our market segment. We feel confident in terms of that rollout as we provided the guidance today and we'll just have to see how that pans out. With the expectation that we will be flat or slightly down for the full year, you are correct in some case that we're going to have to build up to that over the course of the several next quarters. Likely, the second half of the year will definitely be stronger than the first half of the year, and that is our expectation at this time. Tim, one of the things to keep in mind is that we have four growth drivers. We have four growth businesses. Our data center business is growing. It's unquestionably that our footprint is larger than ever. Our ProVis business is growing. Our workstation business now has three ways to grow. One is rendering. The second is data scientists are now a workstation customer that has never happened before. And our software stack with Turing in terms of workstation into an ideal data science workstation. And the third is finally we're able to make workstations into notebooks and they're delightfully thin, using all the same technologies that talked about for gaming notebooks and so workstations is a growth business. And then lastly, our automotive is going to be a gross growth business.
We've been investing, as you know, in self-driving cars. And this year we announced entry into level two plus, our first foot into the mainstream marketplace of autonomous vehicles. And the first design win is Volvo and we have others to announce. And so I think this is going to be a good year for self driving cars as well. So we have four growth businesses, our four core businesses are all growing. And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. First, I wanted to get the mix, this is question Colette. You had said that mix was going to be the primary driver of your gross margins. And I know that sequentially, they're up. But if I correct for the inventory write down in Q4, the normalized gross margin this quarter was 61.7. And so you're guiding it to 59, so it's down 270 basis points sequentially on flat revenues. So do I take from that guidance if that's an indicator of the mix between the businesses is the primary driver of that gross margin degradation, or is there's something else going on that we should be aware of? We'll start with that first question on gross margin. You're correct mix is still the primary driver of our gross margin every single quarter. You've correctly reduced or changed our Q4 numbers to remove the overall inventory write down. So when you look at Q1, there is a mix around our products that we plan on shipping by platforms. But also within our gaming business and within our data center business, we also have different gross margins that would influence. These are our best estimates of what we have at this time and we'll see as we move through the year. So what do you think the bigger between those two, whether it's intra business mix or inter business mix, between the businesses or within the businesses. Which one of those is the biggest driver of the gross margin degradation sequentially into Q1? I think it's more on the inter pieces. Now keep in mind our Q4 had a very low percentage of gaming as a total in terms of there and then different mix within there as we moved in the next quarter as well. So you think it's the mix between the businesses within, like you said, inter. Is that mix between the businesses that you think is the bigger drive there? The mix of the intra, both within the segment as well as between the segments. For my follow-up, Jen-Hsun you and Colette, you mentioned the data center was growing. But if I've got full year revenues for the flat to down slightly and I've got gaming revenues down a bit like you said, and I have ProVis and auto growing. It's really hard within the envelope that guidance to get data centers growing much if at all. I mean, it could even be down within that. I mean how are you thinking about the idea of data center growing within the context of the full year guidance that you're given? Well, in the short-term, in the near-term, we have relatively limited visibility. We don't think it's going to remain this way. And with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year. And so we'll just see how it turns out. This is our year guidance for now and we'll update you as we go. The fundamental dynamics doesn't change. The fact of the matter is that world needs more computing. And a lot of that computing is related to machine learning, data analytics, deep learning. It's related to the things that we're working on. And we have four new ways to grow our data center business. I think our deep learning position is as good as ever. Our scientific computing position is as good as ever. And we have four new ways to grow; we have inference, we have data analytics and machine learning, we have rendering and now we're taking that entire stack to the enterprise. And so I think we have the right strategy, we have the best platform and the utilization, the utility of it is really fantastic. And so with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year and we’ll just report it as we go. And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to ask about again competition and data center. AMD on their call had talked about graphics in their data center business being, biggest server which is worth north of $100 million a quarter, which surprised me. My sense is they're doing quite a bit different applications than you guys are. But maybe just give us some context around what they're doing and how you see the competition coming from within other graphics vendors? Our data center business is really focused on computing and we don't see anybody. Our primary competitor is CPUs. That's really the starting of it and the ending of it. And it's very clear. The vast majority of the world's data center only runs on CPUs today. But the advance of technology has slowed and it's creeping along at a few percent a year and unfortunately, that's just not good enough. And so either data centers are going to continue to increase in CapEx, or they're going to have to find a new approach. And I think people are fairly enthusiastic about university, about accelerated computing. And I think our position is really quite good. And so I would say that those are largely the positions.
If you think about competitively comparing our GPU to a competitor's latest GPU, I think the expectation was really high and didn't turn out quite that way. I think we've established -- the Turing energy efficiency is much better. I think we've established that NVIDIA’s tensor core architecture as a result allows our Volta to be four times the performance of the highest end of the alternative. And the T4 is one fourth the power at the same performance. And so the benefit of having great architectural advantage, a really rich software stack and an engineering that resulted in the energy efficiency that we've achieved generation in and generation out, I think those are those are really great advantages.
And then lastly, because of the broad reach of our architecture, an OEM or a cloud service provider can adopt to our architecture and the utility of it's going to be greater, because there's just a lot more applications. And the best way to reduce costs for any utility is to increase its utility. And I think that our position there is really strong as you could imagine. And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. I have just a couple of questions. The first one Jen-Hsun, it seemed like the Turing platform is delivering some amazing results but as you talked about relying on some new software features to do it. I wonder if you might talk about any steps you're taking in the roadmap to really upgrade performance for the installed base of games, and given the time that it might take for some of those software features to rollout? And then secondly, you noted in the pre-announcement something about the write down having to do with DRAM. I mean obviously that commodity pricing has been volatile. Colette, is there anything you can talk about how big of an effect that might have on the business and on pricing overall? Thank you. First of all, the Turing architecture is the highest performing architecture at every single price point. And it's a big jump from our last generation in every single way. Without ray-tracing the Turing architecture is the first GPU to do concurrent floating point and image your operations at the same time. The instruction per clock of the Turing processor is so much better than our last generation, so much better than what's available in the marketplace.
The cash architecture is a big improvement, and you can just see it in all of the existing games. So just measure the existing games without touching anything, Turing gives you a big boost and that's before we talked about ray-tracing. And we've already spoken about ray-tracing earlier Matt and we know that every single game that are coming out, we're working with the developers to incorporate RTX technology and a very, very big deal, both Epic with Unreal Engine and Unity Engine are going to incorporate ray-tracing. It is very, very clear that the next generation of computer graphics is ray-tracing. And all of the work that we've done with RTX to move the industry forward is well worth it. But remember that's just the graphics part of Turing.
Turing comes with its several new opportunities for growth for us; the first is of course, advancing games; advancing games for notebooks; advancing computer graphics photorealistic rendering for film; all the work that we've done with Tensor Core that we just talked about. It's our second generation Tensor Core making it great for training, as well as inference, a big leap for us for inference. And then lastly all the work that we're doing for data analytics and machine learning will take advantage of all of the capabilities of Turing. And so Turing is a big deal for us. And that's one of the reasons why last year was so busy for us. As we put Turing into workstations, into data centers, into clouds, into rendering, into video games. And so Turing is really a gigantic leap for us architecturally, we're really excited by it. I think the turbulent Q4 overshadowed all of it but in the final analysis, I think Turing was a home run for us. And to also answer your question regarding DRAM prices, yes, they have definitely been volatile over the historical period. It is great to see them coming down in price. Over the long-term, yes, that is beneficial to us from a gross margin perspective. So as we look out to the quarters or later, we will probably be able to incorporate that into our gross margin. And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Building on the discussion around the Turing platform and particularly to the gaming market, I'm curious you mentioned in your prepared comments pricing of these new solutions is a bit of an inhibitor. Has the company invoked any changes in your pricing strategy around Turing? And then also I'd be interested is, can you help us frame how important China is to the gaming segment and whether or not you're assuming that the China market rebounds in your annual assumptions? First of all, on the pricing part, the biggest inhibitor was that we couldn't launch our mid range segment. The ability to launch 2060 was a big inhibitor for us, but we did so at CES. The launch is a great success. The reviews are fantastic. People love 2060, the price point is great. And so now we have great stack from the mid range all the way to enthusiasts. The other part, which because it turned out better is at the time of the launch, there were so many special additions and there were so many over clocked versions that the price point appeared high. But now we have MSRP pricing for all of our segments. And so that's terrific. China's an important market and it's an important gaming market. And I very confidence this is going to rebound. And your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Could you just -- a clarification. Could you repeat what you said you thought the OpEx would grow in this fiscal year? And what is the focus of that investment, to what extent this is R&D versus SG&A? And then maybe one layer deeper, where's the focus of the higher OpEx? Thank you. I'll start off to repeat what we indicated in our transcript. We plan to increase OpEx in the high single-digits over where we finished in terms of fiscal year '19. That is related to our opportunities that we see in front of us, gaming, AI as well as self driving cars. Our focus in terms of investments, we are a very R&D heavy significant company. But there are investments across the board, both in R&D as well as what we need in terms of go to market strategies to obtain these high markets in front of us. And your next question comes from the line Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. So I don't want to poke too many holes on the memory side and the downturn in gaming due to crypto inventory. But if I think about the gross margin profile, you guys almost reached 65%. So if I look out let's call it a year or even 18 months to make it more of a long-term target. Is there any reason why you guys can't get back up to the mid 6s level? On your gross margin question, yes we still have drivers within the mix of our products that allow us to grow our gross margin over the long-term absolutely. And there is definitely a goal for us to continue doing that. So we will focus in terms of both the cost components of what we do, but also moving the entire portfolio to the higher value added platforms that we sell. So over the long term, absolutely all of those things are still in place and intact that we can do. And we'll look quarter-to-quarter to give the best guidance that we can to help you see that. And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Obviously, a pause in data center particularly with the hyperscale, it's pretty well documented. And just curious your perspective particularly being AI still growth area versus more run rate being memory and CPUs. Can you give us any perspective as to how widespread is maybe number of customers or geographic perspective, and just curious how AI is affected with this greater slow down? Thanks. Blayne, the hyperscalars, their pause is probably the most dramatic. We still see a lot of activity in enterprise. It's just a much smaller base for us but we expect it to be a much larger base in the future. And the reason for that is because most of the enterprises today don't use deep learning, they use an approach called machine learning. They might use things like decision trees, or graph analytics, or regressions, or clustering, or things like that, algorithms like that. And they run data analytics applications for business intelligence on large amounts of data, and they might be running it on top of a spark stack that was created out of Berkeley and open source from Databricks. And so there's -- if you recognize some of these things, that's what healthcare companies do and financial services companies do, and retail companies do. They use it for fraud detection, predicting inventory, trying to make the best matches between riders and drivers, and try to predict which route to take to deliver food dinner to you.
And so those applications most of the developers today use machine learning and large big data analytics. So we invested in the stack called RAPIDS and built our architecture, called T4. And we're in the process of partnering with large IT companies to take the stack and the solution out to the world's enterprise. And so, I expect enterprise to be a fairly exciting growth opportunity for us. Meanwhile, the CSPs, their pause will end. The amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning. And we have inference opportunity with the work that we do with T4 and TensorRT. And so we've got a lot of exciting opportunities to go. And your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. A question for Colette, I'm trying to figure out how your position with cloud data centers evolved last year in financial year 2019. So if I look at the cloud CapEx, we are up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business, did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you go faster than overall CapEx? And then I have a follow up on 2020. Let me start out on that piece. As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscales and our hyperscales many of them are also cloud providers did start to slowdown in terms of their purchasing in latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate as you can see from our data center business grew more than 50% for the full year. Now even without strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CapEx that we see in the cloud providers or the overall hyperscales. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas of where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on AI, as they focus on the cloud businesses, and the importance of that compute is necessary. But we're still a very, very small percentage of it. So slowdown in the second half of the year, full year growth, phenomenal growth of 50% and we track with that for this year. But this 50% growth, that's all your overall data center business. Is that's what like specifically your cloud hyperscale business grew well or did that grew even faster with that? Yes, depending on the quarter, we will have a mix of what is hyperscale growth or what is cloud in this. And again in the fourth quarter that was not a growth opportunity for us but earlier in the year definitely it was. And then quickly maybe Jen-Hsun on 2020, so you seem to be very cautious on the data center outlook. When we listen to players like Google and Facebook and others, they all seem to be seemed like very tuned to grow their overall spending this year. And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be -- they all demonstrate a bit of a confidence that in the second half, spending should resume. Is that just because I've been more optimistic than you? Do they say something you don't see? What do you hear from your clients about the second half? Well, we're enthusiastic about the second half. We're enthusiastic about our position. And we're enthusiastic about the solution we offer. And Pure, as you know, we've also expanded our application and our market reach. We guided I think probably the biggest takeaway is we guided flat to slightly down for the whole year, for the whole number. We do have four growth drivers. And maybe the best way to think about it is we should just wait and see how it goes. I think we concerned with where we are. I feel pretty good about our guidance, but I feel even better about our strategic position. And so I look forward to working through the year with you guys. And your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. On the China gaming weakness, is it the slower economic environment or is it government policy related? Because we know that the Chinese government has had a freeze on new gaming approvals, probably recently started to approve new games. This ban is in place I think since the first half of last year. So given what you know the business, how much of the China weakness is coming from China gaming bans versus just overall slower economic environment? I don't know that we could tear that apart, tease that apart, Harlan. We just know that, the China, the consumer market is relatively slow towards the end of the year. And the China economy is in the final analysis of growth economy. And so we're looking forward to it recovering. And gaming is one of the most important pass-times of their culture and so I'm excited about our prospects there. All the things that we're seeing in the near-term, Colette has done a really good job of describing and as we leave the bottom and leave this inventory issue behind us, we're super well positioned. We have a full stack of RTX. The Turing architecture is fantastic. It is unquestionably the best in the world. We have the best performance at every single price point. And we have great notebooks that the market can now buy. And so I'm looking forward to reporting our status with you guys as the year goes on. It should be a good year. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks. 2018 was a record year but it was a disappointing finish. This quarter, we expect to put the channel inventory issue behind us and get back on track. As the pioneer of accelerated computing, our position is unique and strong. And the opportunities ahead in graphic, high performance computing, AI and autonomous machines remain enormous. We are as enthusiastic about these growth opportunities as ever.

All our statements are made as of today, May 16, 2019, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our Web site.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks Simona.
Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion in line with our outlook and down 31% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially consistent with our expectations.
We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our touring lineup with the launch of mid-range GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point starting at $149.
New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650 which bring Turing to the high volume PC gaming side for both desktops and laptops. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal based predecessors leveraging new Shader innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and adaptive shading all with the incredibly power efficient architecture.
We expect continued growth in the gaming laptops this year. GeForce gaming laptops are one of the shining spots of the consumer PC market. This year OEMs have built a record of nearly 100 GeForce gaming laptops. GeForce laptops start at $799 and all the way up to an amazing GeForce RTX 2080 4K laptops that are more powerful than even next generation consoles.
The content ecosystem for Ray traced games is gaining significant momentum. At the March game developers conference, Ray tracing sessions were packed. Support for Ray tracing was announced by the industry's most important game engines, Microsoft DSR, Epics on unreal engine and unity. Ray tracing will be the standard for next generation games.
In March at our GPU technology conference, we also announced more details on our cloud gaming strategy through our GeForce NOW service and the newly announced [indiscernible] alliance. GeForce NOW is a GeForce gaming PC in the cloud for the 1 billion PCs that are not game ready expanding our reach well beyond today's 200 million GeForce gamers. It's an open platform that allows gamers to play the games they own instantly in the cloud on any PC or Mac anywhere they like. The service currently has 300,000 monthly active users with 1 million more on the waitlist.
To scale out to millions of gamers worldwide, we announced the GeForce NOW alliance expanding GFN through partnerships with the global telecom providers, SoftBank in Japan and LG UPlus in South Korea will be among the first to launch GFN later this year.
NVIDIA, we'll develop the software and manage the service and share the subscription revenue with alliance partners. GFN runs on NVIDIA's edge computing servers as telcos raise to offer the new services for their 5G networks, GFN is an ideal new 5G application.
Moving to data center, revenue was $634 million down 10% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending. While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely, others paused or cut back. Despite the uneven demand backdrop, the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call.
First, inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer internet companies. As announced at GTC, Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscale such as Google, Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers. A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adopting our GPUs for influence including LinkedIn, Expedia Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The contribution of inference to our data center revenue is now well into the double-digit percent.
Second, we expanded our reach in enterprise teaming up with major OEMs to introduce the T4 enterprise and edge computing servers. These are optimized to run the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries for AI and data analytics. Within easy to deploy software stack from NVIDIA and our ecosystem partners, this wave of NVIDIA edge AI computing systems enables companies in the world's largest industries, transportation, manufacturing, industrial, retail, healthcare and agricultural to bring intelligence to the edge where the customers operate.
And third, we made significant progress in data center rendering and graphics. We unveiled a new RTX server configuration packing 40 GPUs into an 8-used space and up to 32 servers in a pod providing unparalleled density, efficiency and scalability.
With a complete stack, this server design is optimized for three data center graphic workflows rendering, remote, workstation and cloud gaming. The rendering opportunity is starting to take shape with early RTX server deployment at leading studios, including Disney, Pixar and [indiscernible].
In the quarter, we announced our pending acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion, which we believe will strengthen our strategic position in data center. Once complete the acquisition, we will unite two of the world's leading companies in high performance computing. Together NVIDIA's computing platform and Mellanox's interconnects power over 250 of the world's top 500 supercomputers and have as customers every major cloud service provider and computer maker.
Data centers in the future will be architect as giant compute engines with tens and thousands of compute nodes, designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance. With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize data center scale workloads, across the entire computing networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating costs for customers. Together we can create better AI computing systems for the cloud to enterprise to the edge. As stated at the time of the announcement, we look forward to closing the acquisition by the end of this calendar year.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $266 million up 6% from a prior year and down 9% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by both desktop and mobile workstations, while the sequential decline was largely seasonal. Areas of strength included the public sector, oil and gas and manufacturing. Emerging applications such as AI/AR/VR contributed an estimated 38% a pro visualization revenue. The real-time Ray tracing capabilities of RTX are a game changer for the visual effects industry and we are seeing tremendous momentum in the ecosystem.
At UTC, we announced that the world's top 3D application providers have adopted NVIDIA RTX in their product releases set for later this year including Adobe, Autodesk Chaos group, Dassault and Pixar. With this rich software ecosystem, NVIDIA RTX is transforming the 3D market. For example, Pixar is using NVIDIA RTX Ray tracing on its upcoming films what a digital is using it for upcoming Disney projects and Siemens and x Ray trace studios users will be able to generate rendered images up to 4x faster in their product design workflows. We are excited to see the tremendous value in NVIDIA RTX is bringing to the millions of creators and designers served by ecosystem partners.
Finally, turning to automotive, Q1 revenue was $166 million up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions, an autonomous vehicle development deals.
At GTC we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA's end-to-end platform to develop train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA drive constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus.
We also announced the public availability of Drive Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what's possible to achieve in the real world. Constellation will be reported in our data center market platform. And we introduced NVIDIA Safety Force Field, a computational defensive driving framework that shield autonomous vehicles from collisions mathematically verified and validated in simulation Safety Force Field will prevent a vehicle from creating escalating or contributing to an unsafe starting situation. We continue to believe that every vehicle will have an autonomous capability one day whether with driver or driverless.
To help make that vision a reality NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing and Toyota is our first major win that validates the strategy. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.
Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q1 GAAP gross margins was $58.4% and non-GAAP was 59% down year-on-year to lower gaming margins and mix up sequentially from Q4 which had $128 million charge from DRAM boards and other components. GAAP operating expenses were $938 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $753 million up 21% and 16% year-on-year respectively.
We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020, while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth. Namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.88. We did not make any stock repurchases in the quarter following the announcement of the pending Mellonox acquisition. We remain committed to returning $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases. So far, we have returned $800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.
With that let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth for Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectation earlier in the quarter when our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019. The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter and visibility remains low.
In gaming, the CPU shortage while improving will affect the initial round of our laptop business. For Q2, we expect revenue to be $2.55 billion plus or minus 2%. We expect a stronger second half than the first half and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2% and 59.5% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, $765 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OIME or both expected to be income of approximately $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items.
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR Web site.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5; at the RBC Future of Mobility Conference on June 6; and at the NASDAQ Investor Conference on June 13. Our next earnings call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on August 15.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator will you please poll.
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you've seen in the data center segment. And whether or not, or what you're looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind it. I guess what I'm really asking is kind of what's changed over the last let's call it three months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment. Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business three months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter.
As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward, continuing with our CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of a pause. So, as we look in terms of -- with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility not the best visibility going forward, but still rock solid to what we think are our benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform.
Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscale as well as the enterprises as we think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But, we'll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started three months ago. Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the gaming side last quarter you talked about that being down I think it was termed as being down slightly for the full year. Is that still the expectation or how has that changed? So, at this time, we don't plan on giving a full year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming all of the still drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in the line. While the drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track. But, we're not providing guidance at this time for the full year. And your next question comes from line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the last earnings call, you had mentioned China gaining demand is a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jen-Hsun had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go forward basis and maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography? Sure. China looks like fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent's releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now open in Asia and games are available from the West. So, there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There's some 300 million PC gamers in China and. And then, people are expecting it to grow. We're expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1 plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so, things look fine. Thanks for that. And then, as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look, kind of they get launched October, November timeframe either a total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting you know real-time great racing as well as some of your deal assess capabilities? Yes. Well, it's seasonal second half the year, we expect to see some great games. We won't preannounce anybody else games for them. But, this is this is a great PC cycle because it is the end of the console cycle. And PCs are where the actions at these days. With Battle Royale and Esports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant.
Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to Ray tracing. And at this point I think it's fairly safe to say that that the leadership position that we've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next generation gaming Ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have Ray tracing and some of them already announced it and the partnerships that we've developed are fantastic Microsoft DXR is supporting Ray tracing, Unity supporting ray tracing, Epic is supporting Ray tracing, leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting Ray tracing and movie studios, Pixar has adopted -- announced that they're using RTX and will use artifacts to accelerate their rendering of films.
And so, Adobe and Autodesk jumped on to RTX and that will bring Ray tracing to their content and their tools. And so, I think at this point it's fair to say that that Ray tracing is the next generation and it's going to be adopted all over the world. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thank you. I guess the first question is for Colette. So, what went into decision to pull for your guidance versus just cutting it. Is it really just fear around how long it could take for you no data center to come back? Thank you. Yes. I'll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we are guiding we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter something that we didn't feel was a true representative of our business. And we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward.
We are still experiencing I think the uncertainty as a result of the pause in terms of -- with the overall hyperscale data centers. And we do believe that's going to extend into Q2. However, we do know and expect that our Q2 -- assuming our H2 will likely be sizably larger than our overall H1. And the core dynamics of our business at every level is exactly what we expected. Just that said though, we're going to return to just quarterly guidance at this time. Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative if not quantitative sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July. How that breaks out is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming. Thanks. Yes. So, when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo switch to start again in sizable amount. Once we move into Q2 and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow. And your next question comes from line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Thanks for taking the question. Jen-Hsun, I had a follow up on the data center business. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing not only from your hyperscale customers which you've talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and the HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side.
You guys talk about this pause that you're seeing from your customer base. When you're having conversations with your customers, did they give you a reason as to why they're pausing is it, too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it, optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful too. Thank you. Hyperscale are digesting the capacity they have. At this point, I think it's fairly clear that in the second half of last year they took on a little bit too much capacity. And so, everybody is has paused to give themselves a chance to digest. However, our business on inference is doing great. And we're working with CSPs all over the world to accelerate their inference models.
Now the reason why recently the inference activity has gotten just off the charts because of breakthroughs in what we call conversational AI. In fact, today I think I just saw it today, but have known about this work for some time. Harry Shum's Group, Microsoft AI Research Group today announced their multitask DNN, general language understanding model and it broke benchmark records all over the place.
And basically, what this means is the three fundamental components of conversational AI. which is speech recognition, natural language understanding which this multitask DNN is a breakthrough in and it's based on a piece of work that Google did recently called BERT. And then, text to speech all of the major pieces of a conversational AI are now put together. Of course, it's going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train.
And in the case of Microsoft's network was trained on vault to GPUs and these systems require large amounts of memory, the models are enormous takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so, we're seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI and across the board Internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational. So that you can access through phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere.
The work that we're doing in industries makes a ton of sense. We're seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to healthcare to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they're collecting and I heard a statistic just the other day from a talk to [indiscernible] that some 90% of today's data was created just two years ago and it's being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world.
And so, if you want to put that data to work and you could create the models using our systems, our GPUs for training, and then you can extend that all the way out to the edge. This last quarter, we started to talk about our enterprise server based on T4. This inference engine that has been really successful for us at the CSPs is now going out into the edge and we call them edge servers and enterprise servers. And these edge systems are going to do AI basically instantaneously. It's too much data to move all the way to the cloud. You might have data sovereignty concerns, you want to have very, very low latency, maybe it needs to have multi-sensor fusion capabilities, so it understands the context better.
For example, what it sees and what it hears has to be harmonious. And so, you need that kind of AI, those kind of sensor computing at the edge. And so, we're seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it the intelligent edge. Some people call edge computing and now with 5G networks coming, we're seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we're making. Those are the activity that we're seeing. Thank you. As a quick follow-up on the gaming side, Colette, can you characterize product mix within gaming. You saw in the current quarter, you cited mix as one of the key reasons why gross margins were down year-over-year albeit off a high base going into Q2 in the back half. Would you expect SKU mix within gaming to improve or stay the same? I ask because it's important for gross margins obviously. Thank you. Yes. When you look at our sequential gross margin increase that will be influenced by our larger revenue or larger revenue and better mix, which you're correct is our largest driver of our gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo switch back up and that does have lower gross margins than the company average influencing therefore our Q2 gross margin guidance that we provided.
As we look forward towards the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year. And your next question comes from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. We've talked quite a bit about GeForce now in the prepared remarks and at the Analyst Day. It seems like cloud gaming is going to be a big topic at [83] [ph]. Is that going to be your preferred way to go-to-market with cloud gaming and do you expect to sell GPUs to sort of traditional cloud vendors in non-GeForce NOW fashion? Yes. Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud. And our strategy for our building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so, we'll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack and when we host the service, we will move toward a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world who would like to provision the service at their edge servers and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with their 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator.
In all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low. We have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so, our that's our basic strategy. And we also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers.
Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. Amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also Ray tracing. And so, the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that's possible. Thank you very much. And your next question comes the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jen-Hsun. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at normal levels, when you look at Q2 guidance like all the issues regarding inventory and ratios are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more than normalized run rate for your PC gaming business?
And then, Jen-Hsun, on the data center -- NVIDIA has dominated the training market inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There's a lot of talk of software being written more on the framework level. How should we get the confidence that at your lead-in training will help you maintain good lead and inference also? Thank you. Thanks for the question. So, let's start with your first part of the question regarding how we reached overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day and at the beginning of the quarter. NVIDIA strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition ASR. Our company is focused on accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because the world's body of software is really gigantic and the world's body of software continues to evolve and AI is nowhere near done. We're probably at the first couple of innings of AI of that. And so, the amount of software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve.
Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today whether it's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be a classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework in machine learning overall. And there are so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms.
This whole body of software doesn't run on a single function accelerator. If you would like the body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so, the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of CUDA, so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and it's being announced being integrated into machine learning pipelines in the cloud and elsewhere.
And then, also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that that don't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so, our company is focused on accelerated computing. And speaking of inference that's one of the reasons why we're so successful in inference right now. We're seeing really great pickup. And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application and let's just use one application, one very, very exciting one, conversational AI, you would have to do speech recognition, you would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what did the speeches -- you might have to convert, you have to translate to another language. Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search and then after that you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech.
While some of it could be 8-bit integer, some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point in some of it because of the development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point. And so, the mix precision nature and the computational algorithm nature, flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications. To not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not, we run every single model. And if it doesn't currently run well, we'll help you make it run.
And so, the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So, our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real workloads. And we're going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past. Thank you. And your next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Colette. Colette, you said inference and rendering within data center were both up very strongly, but I guess that has to imply that like the training flash acceleration pieces is quite weak even weaker than the overall. And given those should be adding to efficiency, I'm just surprised it's down that much. Is this truly just digestion? I mean is it share I mean like your competitor is now shipping some parts here? I mean I guess how do we get confidence that just we haven't seen a ceiling on this? I mean do you think given the trajectory you can exit the year above the prior peaks I guess you kind of have to feel given at least the qualitative outlook on the cycle. I guess maybe just any color you can give us on any of those trends would be super helpful. So, as we discussed, Stacy. We are targeting many of the hyperscale definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues. Also in terms of the training; the training instances that they will need for the cloud or for internal use, absolutely. We have some that have pods and going through all those period, so that we do believe because this will come back. We do believe as we look out into the future that they will need that overall deep learning for much of their research as well as many of their workloads. So, no concern on that. But right now, we do see a pause. I will turn it over to Jen-Hsun to see if he has additional comments. Let's see. I think that that when it comes down to training, if your infrastructure team tells you not to buy anything. The thing that suffers is time to market and in some amount of experimentation that allows you to better pause and waiting longer. And then, I should -- I think that for computer vision type of algorithms and recommendation type of algorithms those that posture may not be may not be impossible. However, the type of work that that everybody is now jumping on top of which is natural language understanding and conversational AI and the breakthrough that Microsoft just announced. If you want to keep up with that you're going to have to buy much, much larger machines.
And I'm looking forward to that and I expect that that's going to happen. But in the latter part of last year Q4 and Q1 of this year, we did see pause from the hyperscalers. But, I don't expect it to last. Got it. This is a quick follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the regulatory around Mellanox in the context of what we're seeing out of China now. How do we sort of gauge the risk of potential further deterioration in relationship sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around deal. I we've seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that? Well, on first principles. The acquisition is going to enable data centers around the world whether it's U.S. or elsewhere China to be able to advance much, much more quickly. Now we're going to invest and building infrastructure technology and as a combined company, we'll be able to do that much better. And so, this is good for customers and it's great for customers in China.
The two matters whether it's -- the two matters that we're talking about just are different. One is related to competition in a -- with respect to our acquisition to competition in the market. And the other is related to trade. And so, the two matters are just different. And in our particular case, we bring so much value to the marketplace in China. I mean I'm confident that the market will see that. And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the non-cloud part of your datacenter business. If you think about the trends you're seeing in enterprise virtualization and HPC and all the work you're doing around RAPIDS, rendering et cetera. Can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business, I think that's roughly 50% of the mix, so is at a piece that you feel confident can grow in 2019 and any color around that would be appreciated. We expected to grow in 2019. A lot of our T4 inference work is related to what people call edge computing and it has to be done at the edge because the amount of data that otherwise would be transferred to the cloud is just too much, has to be done at the edge because of data sovereignty issues and data privacy issues. And it has to be done at the edge because the latency requirement is really, really high.
It has to respond basically like a reflex and to make a prediction or make a suggestion or stop the piece of machinery instantaneously. And so a lot of that work that we're doing in T4 inference is partly in the cloud, a lot of it is at the edge. T4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess about halfway through the quarter and the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics -- predictive data analytics is quite large. And the size of the data is growing so significantly and with Moore's Law ending, it's really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so, we've been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware and it's called RAPIDS and I appreciate you saying that. And that's being put together in the activity and get hub is just fantastic.
As you can see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions because they would like to be able to take that open source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so, I expect the enterprise side of our business both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing to be a really good growth driver for us this year. As a follow up, real quickly on auto. It's a business that you've talked about more R&D focus. But clearly, I think it surprised positively, what's the visibility like there and how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year? Our Automotive Strategy has several components. There's the engineering component of it where we -- our engineers and their engineers have to co-develop the autonomous vehicles. And then there's three other components; there's the component of AI computing infrastructure, we call DGX and or any of the OEM servers that include our GPUs that are used for developing the AIs. The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test card. And all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center. And so, we have an infrastructure of what we call DGX that people could use. And so, we're seeing a lot of success there.
We just announced this last quarter a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center. And they're all going through a pseudo directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios and we call that Constellation.
And then, lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car and we call that drive. And so, these are these are the four components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We're doing great in China. There's a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created, the robot taxis developments around the world largely using NVIDIA technology. We recently announced a partnership with Toyota. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're working on. I'm anxious to announce them to you.
But this is an area that that -- is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection delivery drones are all basically use essentially the same technique. And so, this is the this is the foundational work that we do for a larger space that people call the intelligent as your computing at the edge. Your next question comes from line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year, is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you'd expected given the shortage or is it more just about unit volume. And then, just following up on that. What's your level of confidence and that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year? In Q2, we were -- we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It's improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so, the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly and that's affected our initial ramp. We don't expect it to affect our ramp going forward.
And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU which is super energy efficient, in combination made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799 thin and really delightful all the way up to something incredible with a RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use.
And the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had -- I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some hundred notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so, I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It's the fastest growing segment. It is very largely under penetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn't really possible to design a notebook that is both great and performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own.
And so finally, we've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and create a powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that's really wonderful to own and carry around. And so, this is going to be a really -- this is a fast-growing segment and all the OEMs know it and that's why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes and we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks gaming PCs ramping right now. It's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. We've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility and I guess the question is, when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue is next year the year. And then, what would be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution. I presume some at level two plus things you've been talking about would probably most likely there given the amount of volume there, if you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers? Yes. Level 2+ call it 2020, late 2021 or 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019 very, very early for robot taxis, next year substantially more volume for robot taxis 2021 bigger volumes for robot taxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robot taxi because of sensor resolution's, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm all of it put together it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation and so the economics would reflect that.
And so that robot taxi is kind of like next year, year after ramp and then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022. Overall, remember that our economics come from four different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it. There's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation, and then the economics of the car. And so, we just announced Constellation, the enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation. And the next question comes from line of Matt Ramsay with Cowan. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I have two questions, one for Jen-Hsun and one for Colette. I guess Jen-Hsun you've done, you said in many forums that move down to the new process noted 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach and I agree with that. But, maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around 7-nanometer franchising in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program? And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least the anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here.
And secondly, Colette maybe you could talk us through your expectations. I understand there's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue that maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility. Thank you. The entire reason for Q4 and Q1 is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency, has nothing to do with Turing in fact. Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was. And it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was. And so, the pause in gaming is now behind us, we're on a growth trajectory with gaming, RTX has took the lead on Ray tracing and is now going to become the standard for next generation gaming support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet.
And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented and the last couple of quarters have also intersected with overlapped with the seasonal slowdown that -- not so, but build that the seasonal builds of the Nintendo switch and we're going to go back to normal build cycle.
And as Colette said earlier somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we'll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we're off to a great start in Turing and I'm super excited about that. And then, in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom, our Turing architecture spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so, I think we're in pretty good shape.
In terms of process notes we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists and it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our current GPUs. And so that the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those two things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that. And to the second question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year. We're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with the year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in a high single digit. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there. But our year-over-year growth start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this past year. But, I do believe we're on track to meet that goal. And I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks. Thanks everyone. We're glad to be returning to growth. We are focused on driving three growth strategies. First, RTX ray tracing. It's now clear that ray tracing is the future of gaming and digital design. And NVIDIA RTX is leading the way with the support of Microsoft DXR, Epic, Unity, Adobe and Autodesk. Game publishers like EA, movie studios like Pixar, industry support has been fantastic.
Second, accelerated computing and AI computing, the pause in hyperscale spending will pass. Accelerated computing and AI are the greatest forces in computing today and NVIDIA is leading these movements. Whether cloud or enterprise or AI at the edge for 5G or industries NVIDIA is one scalable architecture from cloud to edge is a focal point platform for the industry to build AI upon.
Third robotics, some call it embedded AI, some edge AI or autonomous machines. The same computing architecture is used for self-driving cars, pick and place robotics arms, delivery drones and smart retail stores. Every machine that move or machines that watch other things that move whether with driver or driverless will have robotics and AI capabilities. Our strategy is to create an end-to-end platform that spans NVIDIA's DGX AI computing infrastructure to NVIDIA Constellation simulation to NVIDIA AGX embedded AI computing.
And finally, we're super excited about the pending acquisition of Mellonox. Together we can advance cloud and edge architectures for HPC and AI computing. See you next quarter. And this concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q2 revenue was $2.58 billion, in line with our outlook, down 17% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter when we launched our RTX SUPER lineup for desktop gamers, wrapped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX studio laptops for creators.
In July, we unveiled 3 GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, delivering the best-in-class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next-generation games. These GPUs delivered a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The SUPER lineup strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back to school and holiday shopping seasons. Ray tracing is taking the gaming industry by storm and have quickly come to define the modern era of computer graphics. A growing number of blockbuster AAA titles have announced support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.
Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core. The laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console.
At Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large, underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that’s up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs. Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the two new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year.
Moving to data center, revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid. While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing.
Let me give some color on each of these areas. We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA’s platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Wal-Mart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Wal-Mart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features.
Earlier this week, we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language, context and meaning. This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances. AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA.
Delivering AI at scale isn’t just about silicon. It’s about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong. In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We have made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers. Also at the conference, we announced that by next year’s end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA’s full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM. Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected, and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year.
Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from our prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors. We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry’s biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles. Our researchers won several Best in Show awards. In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing, over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors, including Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others. NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Finally, turning to automotive, Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including one particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day. Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world’s transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025.
Moving to the rest of the P&L, Q2 GAAP gross margins was 59.8% and non-GAAP was 60.1%, up sequentially, reflecting higher automotive development services, a favorable mix in gaming and lower component cost. GAAP operating expenses were $970 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $749 million, up 19% and 8% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.90, down 49% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, down 36% from a year ago.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $980 million and $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Jefferies conference, hardware and communications infrastructure summit, on August 27 and at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 25. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for the questions? [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first question on gaming, how should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-à-vis kind of normal seasonality? How are you thinking about Switch within that? And considering now that you have full Turing lineup as well as content truly coming to the forefront here, how do you think about trends beyond the October quarter? Thank you. Sure. Colette, why don’t you take the Switch question? And then I will take the rest of the RTX questions. Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall Switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business. We usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3, with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see Switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3. Yes. C.J., thanks for your question. RTX as you know is – first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we have put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several 6 games in the last couple of months. There is going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It’s pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create – with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular. We now have 40 – over 40 ISV tools that was announced at SIGGRAPH that have accelerated ray tracing and video editing. And some of the applications’ amazing AI capabilities for image optimization enhancement support RTX.
And so looking forward, this is what I expect. I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed – RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it’s extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are – like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we’re expecting it to grow through the end of the – through the second half and through next year. And one of the things that’s really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high-definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we are ramping and of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us. Very helpful. If I could follow-up on the data center side, perhaps you can speak directly just to the hyperscale side, both internal and cloud, and whether you’re seeing any green shoots, any signs of life there and how you are thinking about what that rate of recovery could look like over time? With the exception of a couple of hyperscalers, C.J., I would – we’re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. In the area of training, the thing that’s really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft’s MASS. And there are so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody’s racing to go to. And so, these models are really, really large. It’s over 1,000x larger than image models that we’re training just a few years ago, and they’re just gigantic models. It’s one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area – so that’s training in the hyperscalers. The second area where we are seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it’s off of the most busy time of the day. You can’t do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that’s required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time – in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent. And so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we’re seeing that AI is – the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we’re seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we’re seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it’s a delivery robot or some kind of a Chat Bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There’s some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we’re the only AI platform that’s available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for – in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that’s one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we’re seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that. And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alright thanks for taking my questions. I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between – 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year – on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime – later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase? This is the one part of the business that I think is toughest for us to model, so any color would be very helpful. Great, so let me start first with your question, Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we’ll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We’ve reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements. Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there’s no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it’s going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple – a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There’s a couple of different dynamics that’s causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It’s thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you cannot predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we’ve created is really the ideal architecture.
We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where – that’s when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology – early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that’s really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions instead of having a page of – a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one. The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they’re using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that – used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you’re putting all over the world. And that’s the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we’re about to enter into.
And then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it’s life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It’s a $100 trillion industry. We know it’s going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that’s just a matter of time before we realize its full potential. And so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that’s why we’re all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it’s going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully – well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world. And so this is a big market, and I’m super enthusiastic about it. And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I had two as well, one for Jensen and the other for Colette. Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that’ll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you’re guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well. Thank you. Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I’m less good at normal pre – near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is – remains robust. It’s double digits. It’s a large part of our business. And – but more importantly, the two dynamics that I think are near term and that’s going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference. If you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would – pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you’re at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you’re interested and how far you’re willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human – a human understand a voice. And those models have to happen in just a few – ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it’s not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that’s the near-term opportunity, it’s interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it’s caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it and so near-term conversational AI inference. But, we are also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it’s not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you’re streaming is continuous. And so you don’t want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we’re seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term – two near-term drivers, and I think it’s fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities. So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we’ll continue to see improvements on that as well. And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Again on your data center business, many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2 driven primarily by enterprise. It seems like you had some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter. Inferencing continues to see strong momentum. Would you guys expect that this translates into a double-digit percentage sequential growth in data center in Q3 off of the low base in Q2? Our hyperscale data center with a few customers don’t give us very much – we don’t get very much visibility from a handful of customers in hyperscale. However, we’re seeing broad-based growth and excitement in data centers. And the way to think about data center, our data center business consists of hyperscale training, internal training, hyperscale inference, cloud computing – and that’s hyperscale, and that cloud is a public cloud. And then we have vertical industry enterprise, what sometimes we call enterprise, vertical industry enterprise, it could be transportation companies, retailers, telcos, vertical industry adoption of AI either to accelerate their business or to develop new products and services. And then the – so when you look at our data center from that perspective and these pieces, although we don’t see as much – we don’t get as much visibility as we like in a couple of the large customers, the rest of the hyperscalers, we’re seeing broad-based growth. And so we’re experiencing the enthusiasm and the energy that maybe the others are and so we will keep updating you guys as we go. We will see how it goes. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. I had two. I guess first for Jensen, Volta’s been around now for about 2 years. Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I’m just wondering whether there’s some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That’s the first question. And then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I’m wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like two-third gaming and one-third data centers, something like that? Thanks. Well, Volta data center products can churn that fast. We gamers could churn products quickly because they’re bought and sold one at a time. But data centers data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We’re still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so, you could just imagine the amount of software that’s built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers. The software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that’s one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so, when we’re able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don’t bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so, I think the way to think about Volta is that it’s surely in its prime, and it’s going to keep continue to do well all the way through next year. In regard to our guidance on revenue, and we do guide in terms of the total. You have seen, in this last quarter, we executed a sequential increase really focusing on moving to a normalization of our gaming business. And we’re now approaching the second half of the year getting ready for the back to school and the holidays. So, you should expect also our gaming business to continue to grow to reach that full normalization by the end of Q3. We do expect the rest of our platforms to likely also grow. We have a couple different models on how that will come out. But yes, we do expect our data center business to grow, and then we’ll see on the rest of our businesses as well. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. I guess the first one is Jensen, if you have any, I guess, high-level qualitative commentary on how the new SUPER upgrades of your Turing platform have been received in the market and how you might think about them progressing through the year. And then, I guess, the second question is a bigger one. Intel’s talked quite openly about One API. The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP. I mean you guys get a lot of credit for the decade of work that you’ve done on CUDA. But I wonder if you might comment on if you’ve seen any movement in the competitive landscape on the software side for the data center space. Thank you. SUPER is off to a great start. Goodness, SUPER is off to a super start. And if you look at if you do channel checks all over, even though we’ve got a lot of products in the channel and we last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn’t we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so, and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they’re sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP. That just tells you something about demand. And so that’s really exciting. SUPER is off to a super start for and at this point, it’s a foregone conclusion that we’re going to buy a new graphics card, and it’s going to the last 2, 3, 4 years to not have ray tracing is just crazy. Ray tracing content just keeps coming out. And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware, it’s going to be super well positioned for throughout all of next year.
Your question about APIs and software programmability, APIs is just one of the issues. The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer and how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it’s an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It’s a concept that’s not easy to grasp. And so, I don’t really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can’t make it fit in my head. But programming isn’t as simple as a PowerPoint slide, I guess. And I think it’s just time will tell whether one programming approach could fit 7 different types of processors when no time in history has it ever happened. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the automotive business. Looks like the services piece of that is getting to be bigger, what’s the outlook for that part of the business? And can you give us a sense of the mix between services and components at this point? Sure. Thanks, Joe. Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts. The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the two systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay. And then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so, although the cars will take several years to go into production, we’re seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so, we’re the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so, my sense is that we’re going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses. Those kinds of autonomous machines require basically the same technology, but it’s sooner and easier to deploy. And so, we are seeing a lot of excitement around that area. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Yes, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the improved performance. At your Analyst Day back a couple of months ago, you had highlighted the installed base opportunity for RTX. And I think at that point in time, you talked about 50% being Pascal base, 48% being pre-Pascal. You also alluded to the fact that you were seeing a positive mix shift higher in terms of the price points of this RTX cycle. So, I’m curious, where do we stand on the current product cycle? And what are you seeing currently as we go through this product cycle on the Turing platforms? We launched well, first of all, the answer is that RTX adoption is faster than Pascal’s adoption if you normalize to time 0 of launch. The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren’t able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it’s a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world’s first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so, I think it’s sensible that Turing’s adoption is going to be rapid. The second element of Turing is something that we’ve never talked about before. We’re mentioning it more and more because it’s such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high-performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to we’re now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it’s still beautiful. And so, this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us. And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop, I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us.
And then the new market that we introduced and launched this last quarter is called RTX Studio. And this is an underserved segment of the market where consumers, enthusiasts, they could be artists that are working on small firms, they need powerful computers to do their work. They need powerful computers to do rendering and high-definition video editing. And yet it’s underserved by workstations because workstations are really sold on a B2B basis into large enterprises. And so, we aligned all of the OEMs and created a whole new line of notebooks called RTX Studio. And the enthusiasm has been great. We’ve launched 27 different laptops, and I’m looking forward to seeing the results of that. This is tens of millions of people who are creators. Some of them professionals, some of them hobbyists. And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so, this is an underserved market that we’re excited to go serve with RTX Studio. And your last question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Colette. My first question is on data center. So, I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn’t sound like broad-based growth to me unless like did the hyperscalers get worse or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what’s going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed? So, to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we’re discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we’re continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing, some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that’s for cloud instances or whether or not they’re using it for internal use. So, we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI and we are just really pleased with what we are seeing in that growth this quarter. I’ll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. We are happy with our results this quarter and our return to growth across our platforms. Gaming is doing great. It’s great to see NVIDIA RTX reinvigorating the industry. GeForce has several growth drivers. Ray traced games continue to gain momentum. A large number of gaming laptops are rolling out, and our new Studio platform is reaching the large underserved community of creators. Outside a few hyperscalers, we’re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. More and more enterprises are using AI to create new products and services while leveraging AI to drive ultra efficiency and speed in their business. And with hyperscalers racing to harness recent breakthroughs in conversational AI, we see growing engagements in training as well as interactive conversational inference. RTX, CUDA accelerated computing, AI, autonomous vehicles, the work we’re doing is important, impactful and incredibly fun. We’re just grateful there is so much of it. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. This concludes today’s conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, two dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on the heels of CONTROL, an action adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week's PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement. RTX GPUs now drive more than 2/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue.
Gaming laptops were a standout, driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth. This holiday season, our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers, students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market. This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology, triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year.
In late October, we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super, which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance, faster memory and new features. The 1660 Super delivers 50% more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060, the best-selling gaming GPU of all time. It began shipping on October 29, priced at just $229. PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming.
We also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models, Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which launched on October 28. These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks. Shield TV has been widely recognized as the best streamer on the market.
Finally, we made progress in building out our cloud gaming business. Two global service providers, Taiwan Mobile and Russia's Rostelecom with GFN.ru joined SoftBank and Korea's LG as partners for our GeForce NOW game-streaming service. Additionally, Telefónica will kick off a cloud gaming proof-of-concept in Spain.
Moving to data center. Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google's breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past. Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here.
Second, real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition, language understanding, text-to-speech and voice encoding. While conventional approaches fail at these tasks, NVIDIA's GPUs can handle the entire inference chain, in less than 30 milliseconds. This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration. Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference.
In addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity, our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds. In September, Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally, following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year. We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs, and both were records. Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue.
Last week, the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference, MLPerf inference, were announced. We won. In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications, NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks. This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads, which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us.
Several product announcements this quarter helped extend our AI computing platform into new markets, the enterprise edge. At Mobile World Congress, Los Angeles, we announced a software-defined 5G wireless RAN solution accelerated by GPUs in collaboration with Ericsson. This opens up the wireless RAN market to NVIDIA GPUs. It enables new AI applications as well as AR, VR and gaming to be more accessible to the telco edge.
We announced the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. With an ecosystem of more than 100 technology companies worldwide, early adopters include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, NTT East and the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas. Additionally, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing. This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure.
Finally, last week, we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers, CIOs and federal employees. At the event, we announced that the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest delivery service with almost 150 billion pieces of mail delivered annually, is adopting AI technology from NVIDIA, enabling 10x faster processing of package data and with higher accuracy.
Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $324 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 11% sequentially driven primarily by mobile workstations. NVIDIA RTX graphic and Max-Q technology have enabled a new wave of mobile workstations that are powerful enough for design applications yet thin and light enough to carry. We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities.
Over 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs. Just last week, at the Adobe Max Conference, RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps. RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers, driving demand for our RTX GPUs. We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science, AI and VR applications. Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing, public sector, higher education and health care customers.
Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $162 million, down 6% from a year ago and down 22% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2. Additionally, we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness. Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
In August, Optimus Ride launched New York City's first autonomous driving pilot program powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. Urban settings pose unique challenges for autonomous vehicles given the number of density of objects that need to be perceived and comprehended in real time. Our DRIVE computer and software stack allows these shuttles to safely and effectively provide first- and last-mile transit services. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in auto. Our offering is -- consists of in-car AV computing platforms as well as GPU servers for all AI development and simulation. We believe we are well positioned in the industry with leading end-to-end platform that enables customers to develop, test and safely operate autonomous vehicles, ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robo-taxis.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 63.6%, and non-GAAP was 64.1%, up sequentially, reflecting a benefit from sales of previously written-off inventory, higher GeForce GPUs average selling prices and lower component costs. GAAP operating expenses were $989 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $774 million, up 15% and 6% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $1.45, down 26% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78, down 3% from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox.
We expect revenue to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects expectations for strong sequential growth in data center, offset by a seasonal decline in notebook GPUs for gaming and Switch-related revenue. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 64.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.02 billion and $805 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Crédit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3, Deutsche Bank's Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette. Yes. Thanks a lot, Vivek. We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers. As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors. The -- as you know, we've been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn't really take that much of the data center capacity.
Over the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you're watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections, all of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you're going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning.
The second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time.
And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we're seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and they're getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers.
The second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there's a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor, there's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don't have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot.
And then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn't own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can't afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA's full stack of every single model. And it's managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can't afford to go out there to manage them. And we've seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service.
And so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it's nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there's like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1/3 of the world's land mass. And so there's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX. Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you're probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October -- into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out? Yes. During Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we're seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it's so important. I would say that at this point, I think it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them.
Second, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand-new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I'm excited about that. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. I have a follow-up if I can as well. Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you had the benefit of selling through some written-off components. So I guess first question is what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter. And how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter? What should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend? And again, I have a quick follow-up. Sure. Thanks for the question. In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time. Over the long term, we do expect gross margins to improve, and we'll continue to see, outside of the benefit that we received, gross margin improvement for the long term. Yes. As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA's really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU -- having the world's best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it's in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can't just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we're a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers. And as a platform company that has a great deal of software intensity, it's natural that the margins would be higher over time. Yes. Very helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen hyperscale -- your hyperscale business within data center grow both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis in this last print. You also mentioned that your visibility is improving. Can you just help us understand what exactly you're seeing in the hyperscale guys because it feels like there's some mixed data points out there? What underpins your improved visibility? Or what are you seeing in that piece of your business? Yes. We had a strong Q3. We're going to see a much stronger Q4. And the foundation of that is AI, it's deep learning inference. That is -- this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train.
I mentioned earlier about conversational AI. Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why -- although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated -- we submitted all 5 results -- all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it's really quite a great challenge. And it's one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn't been solved, and we've been working hard at it for the last 6, 7 years now.
And so this is really the great opportunity. We've been talking about inference for some time now. Finally, the workloads and a very large diverse set of workloads are now moving into production. And so I'm hoping -- I'm enthusiastic about the progress and seeing the trends and the visibility that inference should be a large market opportunity for us. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess I'd love to follow on, on that last question. So clearly, your commentary, Jensen, here is much more bullish than I've heard you, I think, before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so I guess can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12, 24 months as you see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise, considering, I would think, inference over time could be -- could grow into a large opportunity there as well? Yes. C.J., that's really good. Let me break it down. So when we think about hyperscale, there are three parts: training, inference and public cloud.
Training, you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they've been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think what we're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing, training.
The second part is an untapped market for us, and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They're very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I've talked about this before, but I've never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only -- the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the -- our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global. We're working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems, conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really, really interesting problems.
Now the cloud is the third piece. And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups. And these start-ups, of course, use cloud service providers so that they don't have to invest in their own infrastructure because it's fairly complicated. And so we're seeing a lot of growth there.
And so that's just the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth -- 3 areas of growth: training, inference and public cloud. And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups. Then there's the intelligent edge, which we recently ventured into, and we've been building this platform called EGX for some time. And it's cloud native. It's incredibly secure. You can manage it from afar. It's -- the stack is complicated. It's performant. And we saw some -- we've been working with some early adopters. And this last quarter, we announced some of them: Walmart and BMW and Procter & Gamble and the largest logistics company in the world, USPS. And so this new platform, I think, long term, will likely be the largest opportunity. And the reason for that is because of the industries that it serves. And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. There are a lot of concerns around China trade tensions, economic slowdown. But history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends and, in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography? Gaming is solid in China, and it is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn't get the technology in there so that it's both delightful to own as well as powerful to enjoy. And so we saw really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China, and RTX adoption has been fast.
Your comments make sense because most of the games are free-to-play these days. The primary games that people play are esports, which you want the best gear, but you could -- after you buy the gear, you pretty much enjoy it forever; and mobile, which is largely free-to-play. You invest in some of your own personal outfits. And after that, I think you can enjoy it for quite a long time. And so the gear is really important. One of the areas where we've done really great work, particularly in China, has to do with social. We have this platform called GeForCe Experience. And as an extension of that, there's a new feature called RTX Broadcast Engine. And it basically applies AI to broadcasting your content to share it. You could make movies. You could capture your favorite scenes and turn it into art, applying AI. And one of the coolest features is that you could overlay yourself on top of the game and share it with all the social networks without a green screen behind you. We use AI to stitch you out, basically, to cut you out of the background and irrespective of what noisy background you've got.
And so as you know, China has really a super hyper social community -- communities back there and they have all kinds of really cool social platforms to share games and user-generated content and short videos and all kinds of things like that. And so GeForce has that one additional feature that really makes it successful. And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask on automotive. Colette, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your legacy infotainment business being down in the quarter. Just curious, what percentage of automotive revenue at this point is legacy infotainment versus the newer AI/ADAS solutions? And more importantly, Jensen, if you can speak to the growth trajectory in automotive over the next 1.5 years, maybe 2, that would be appreciated. And I do ask the question because it feels like we've heard many, many announcements, customer announcements, collaborative work that you're doing with your customers, yet we haven't quite seen sort of a hockey-stick inflection that some of us were expecting a couple of years ago. So just kind of curious when we should -- how we should set our expectations going forward. Yes. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems for our automotive business. It is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well, both sequentially as well as year-over-year, as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing, including development services. Let's see. The -- we're the first -- probably the first AV car that's going to be passenger-owned on the road, and I think we've talked about it before, is Volvo. And we're expecting them to be in the late 2020, early 2021 time frame. And I'm still expecting so. And then there's the 2022, 2023 generations. Most -- I would say most of the passenger-owned vehicle developments are going quite well. The industry, as you know, is under some amount of pressure, and so a lot of them have slipped it out a couple of years or so. And this is something that I think we've already spoken about in the past.
Our focus, our strategy consists of several areas. One area, of course, is passenger-owned vehicles. The second part is robot taxis. We have developments going with just about every major robot taxi company that we know of. And they're here in the states. They're in Europe. They're in China. And when you hear news of them, we're delighted to see their progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don't carry people, they carry goods. And so we have a major development with Volvo. That was Volvo Trucks. Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are 2 different companies. One of them belongs to Geely, Volvo Cars. Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods.
You also see us during various GTCs, I'll mention companies that we're working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You're going to see a whole bunch of things like that because the technology is very similar, and it's starting to -- the development -- the technology we develop for passenger-owned vehicles has started to propagate down into logistics vehicles. I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that, I think, is, at this point, fairly certain.
Now our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system, and it's software-defined, it's scalable, as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody's working on AV and they're using AI, and most of them are, there's a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up and they're collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us. And so I'm anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV. And they will be. They will be. This is a foregone conclusion. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. I have two data center questions for Colette. The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you're calling it out in Q4 and you didn't call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4? Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially. So I guess to ask the question again, would you define what you saw in Q3 as being strong growth as well? I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4, we'll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy. Okay. And for my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year. Now -- and that's after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me -- I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what's going on there? What drove that? And what should we expect going forward? Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3. Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC. I apologize for any background noise, but I just have one question, just for Jensen. So in 2018, can you give us a rough update on what the GPU utilization was for deep learning application? What it is today? I'm just wondering how the -- how that's advanced over the last couple of year or two. Let's see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now -- we have now sold more -- this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that's used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They're at record levels. And T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago, now it's selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think that's really the major difference that inference is really kicking into gear, and my sense is that it's going to continue to grow quite nicely. And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there -- how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU? Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it's really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that's necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it's a VM environment like VMware. And we -- recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner -- we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they're seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we're going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes.
And so our strategy is to -- our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we're going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we've done for creating a -- excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center.
The power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can't do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center's computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they're geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that's really -- this is really the future that we're going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT -- AI and IoT applications And your last question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. I apologize for the background noise. But Colette, maybe you could give us an idea of gaming. In the guidance, it's down. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there? I would say, for our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need. So we will have to see how the quarter ends on that. But in both cases, in totality, these businesses have ranged, maybe in totality of the 2, of about $500 million a quarter. And we'll see both of them sequentially decline. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by strong gaming growth and hyperscale demand. We're making great strides in 3 big impact initiatives. The world of computer graphics is moving to ray tracing, and our business reflects that. Some of the biggest blockbuster games this holiday season and beyond are RTX-enabled, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and the best-selling game of all-time, Minecraft. Design applications used by millions of artists and creators are rapidly adopting RTX ray tracing. We're reinventing computer graphics and look forward to upgrading the hundreds of millions of PC gamers to RTX.
Hyperscale demand was strong this quarter, and our visibility continues to improve. The race is on for conversational AI, which will be a powerful catalyst for us in both training and inference. And lastly, we have extended our computing platform beyond the cloud to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT, will revolutionize the world's largest industries. We look forward to updating you on our progress in February. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q4 revenue was $3.11 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially, well above our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming businesses. Full year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 7%. We recovered from the excess channel inventory in gaming and an earlier pause in hyperscale spending and exited the year with great momentum.
Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.49 billion was up 56% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from our prior year. We enjoyed strong end demand for our desktop and notebook GPUs.
Let me give you some more details. Our gaming lineup was exceptionally well positioned for the holidays, with the unique ray tracing capabilities of our RTX GPUs and incredible performance at every price point. From the Singles Day shopping event in China, through the Christmas season in the West, channel demand was strong for our entire stack.
Fueling this were new blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, continued esports momentum and new RTX SUPER products. With RTX price points as low as $299, ray tracing is now the sweet spot for PC gamers. Gaming is thriving and gamers prefer GeForce.
The global phenomenon of esports keeps gaming momentum with an audience now exceeding 440 million, up over 30% in just two years, according to Newzoo. The League of Legends World Championship brought more than 100 million viewers on par with this month's Super Bowl.
Ray tracing titles continue to come to market and GeForce RTX GPUs are the only ones that support this important technology. This quarter Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon were the latest titles to support ray tracing, as well as NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technique, which also uses AI to boost performance.
With the proliferation of RTX-enabled games and our best ever top-to-bottom performance, we are solidly into the Turing Architecture upgrade cycle. Gamers continue to move to higher-end GPUs, seeking better performance and support for ray tracing.
Gaming laptops posted double-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The category continues to expand, driven by appealing thin and light form factors with fantastic graphics performance. This holiday season retailers stocked a record 125 gaming laptops based on NVIDIA GPUs, up from 94 last year, with our Max-Q designs up 2x.
At CES we launched the world's first 14-inch, GeForce RTX laptop with ASUS. We also continue to expand our Studio lineup of laptops for the fast-growing population of freelance creators, designers and Youtubers with 13 new RTX Studio systems introduced at CES.
Powered by Turing GPUs, these systems are optimized for over 55 creative and design applications with RTX accelerated ray tracing and/or AI. Last week, we launched our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.
Powered by GeForce, GeForce NOW is the first cloud gaming service to deliver ray trace games. It's also the only open platform, so gamers can enjoy the games they already have. And use their existing store accounts without having to repurchase games.
GeForce NOW enables PC games on Mac, Windows, PCs, TVs, mobile devices and soon Chromebooks. GFN has a freemium business model that includes two membership plans.
A free membership with standard access and the Founders tier with a starting price of $4.99 per month which gives priority access and RTX ray tracing support. Our goal with GeForce NOW is to expand GeForce gaming to more gamers.
About 80% of GeForce NOW gamers are playing on underpowered PCs or devices with Mac OS or Android. With GeForce NOW, they are able to enjoy PC gaming on a GeForce GPU in the cloud.
GeForce Now can expand GeForce well beyond the roughly 200 million gamers we reach today. Separately, we entered into a collaboration with Tencent, the world's largest gaming platform to bring PC gaming in the cloud to China, the world's largest gaming market.
NVIDIA GPU technology will power Tencent's Start cloud gaming service, which is in early testing stages. Moving to data center, revenue was a record $968 million, up 43% year-on-year and up 33% sequentially, our strongest ever sequential growth in dollar terms.
Full year fiscal year 2020 data center revenue was a record $2.98 billion up, 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale and vertical industry end customers.
Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products, in support of key AI workloads such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators.
Hyperscale demand was also driven by cloud computing. AWS now makes the T4 available in every region. This underscores the versatility of the T4 which excels at a wide array of high-performance computing workloads, including AI inference, cloud gaming, rendering, and virtual desktop.
Vertical industry growth was driven primarily by, consumer Internet companies. Other verticals, such as, retail, health care, and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs, with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements.
And we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing, data science and edge computing applications. T4, our inference platform had another strong quarter, with shipments up 4x, year-on-year driven by public cloud deployments, as well as edge AI video analytics applications.
T4 and V100, reflecting strong demand for inference and training respectfully, set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue. Even as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training, NVIDIA's inference platform is gaining wide use by some of the world's leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies, including American Express, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter.
The industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA. For example, Microsoft's biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference, of its natural language understanding models.
These DNN transformer models, popularized by BERT, have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models. Conversational AI is a major new workload, requiring GPUs for inference to achieve, high throughput within the desired low latency.
Indeed, Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide. And just this week, Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2. This advances the state-of-the-art for AI assistance and tasks such as answering questions, summarization and natural language generation.
Recommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet powering billions of queries per second. The industry is moving to deep recommendators, such as wide & deep model, which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content. Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs.
For example Alibaba's and Baidu's recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitude beyond CPUs. Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10% increase in click-through rates.
We also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure. It enables customers for the first time to rent an entire AI supercomputer on demand from their desk, matching the capabilities of large on-premise supercomputers that can take months to deploy. And in Europe, energy company Eni announced the world's fastest industrial supercomputer based on NVIDIA GPUs.
AI has even come to pizza delivery. At the National Retail Federations Annual Conference last month, we announced Domino's as a customer deploying our platform for deep learning and data science applications helping with customer engagement and order accuracy prediction.
More broadly in retail, we have seen a significant increase in the adoption of NVIDIA's edge computing offerings by large retailers for powering AI applications that reduce shrinkage, optimize logistics and create operational efficiencies. At the SC19 Supercomputing conference, we introduced a reference design platform for GPU-accelerated ARM-based servers along with ecosystem partners, ARM, Ampere computing Fujitsu and Marvell.
We made available our ARM-compatible software development kit consisting of NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and development tools for accelerating computing. This opens the floodgate of innovation to support growing new applications from hyperscale cloud to exascale supercomputing.
We also introduced NVIDIA Magnum IO, a suite of software optimized to eliminate storage and input/output bottlenecks. Magnum IO delivers up to 20x faster data processing for multi-server, multi-GPU computing nodes when working with massive data sets to carry out complex financial analysis, climate modeling and other workloads for data scientists, high-performance computing and AI researchers.
Finally, we introduced TensorRT 7, the seventh generation of our inference software development kit, which speeds up components of conversational AI by 10x comparing to running on CPUs. This helps drive latency below the 300 millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions supporting our growth in conversational AI.
Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $331 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially. Full year revenue was a record $1.21 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. ProVis accelerated in Q4 as the rollout of more RTX-enabled applications is driving strong upgrade cycle for our Turing GPUs.
RTX is also opening up new market segment opportunities such as rendering and studio for freelance creatives. In November, V-ray Arnold and Blender software renderers began shipping with RTX technology. These joined our leading creative and design applications including Premier Pro, Dimension, SolidWorks, CATIA and Maya.
With RTX, these applications enable enhanced creativity and notable productivity gains. In Blender Cycles for example, real-time rendering performance is boosted 4x versus a CPU. RTX is now supported by more than 40 leading creative and design applications reaching a combined user base of over 40 million.
Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $163 million, flat from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Full year revenue reached a record $700 million, up 9% year-on-year. During the quarter, we announced DRIVE, AGX Orin, the next-generation platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, powered by our new Orin SoC and delivering nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation Xavier SoC. The platform scales from level two plus AI-assisted driving to level five fully driverless operation. Orin is software-defined and compatible, with Xavier allowing developers to leverage their investment across multiple product generations.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 64.9% and non-GAAP was 65.4%, up sequentially, largely reflecting higher contribution of data center products. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $1.02 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $810 million, up 12% and 7% year-on-year respectively. Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 66% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.89, up 136% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was $1.46 billion. Fiscal year 2020 cash flow from operations was a record $4.76 billion.
With that, let me turn the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The outlook does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We are engaged and progressing with China on the regulatory approval and believe the acquisition will likely close in the first part of calendar 2020.
Before we get to the new -- the numbers let me comment on the impact of the coronavirus. While it is still early and the ultimate effect is difficult to estimate, we have reduced our Q1 revenue outlook by $100 million to account for the potential impact. We expect revenue to be $3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65% and 65.4% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. Further, financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on the IR website. In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on March 2nd in San Francisco.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Hi guys. Thanks very much for the question. I guess on data center Colette or Jensen, can you speak to some of the areas that drove the upside in the quarter? You talked about inference in both the T4 and the V100 having record quarters, but relative to your internal expectations. What were some of the businesses that drove the upside and if you can also speak to the breadth of your customer profile today relative to a couple of years ago, how that's expanded. That would be helpful as well. Thank you. Yes. Toshiya thanks a lot for your question. The primary driver for our growth is AI. There are four fundamental dynamics. The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs in fact in natural language understanding, in conversational AI and recommendation systems.
And you know this, but for the others in the audience, recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today. And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world, whether it's a store or whether it's content or websites or information you are querying, there are hundreds of billions, trillions and depending on how you count it hundreds of trillions of items in the world.
And there are billions of people each with their own characteristics and there are countless contexts. And between the items the people the users and the various contexts that we're in location and what you're looking for and weather or what's happening in the environment, those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you.
The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search in the beginning and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time over the last year, it's been able to be done in deep learning.
And so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI which means that whereas, we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the model is getting larger and there are more of them we're seeing a lot of these models going into production and that business is called inference.
Inference as Colette mentioned, grew 4 times year-over-year. It's a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don't understand about Inference is, it's an incredibly complex computational problem, but it's an enormously complex software problem. And so, the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called Inference.
The third is the growth not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud. And the OpEx model works much better for them as they're younger. When they become larger they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud.
We're also seeing really great success in verticals. One of the most exciting vertical is logistics, logistics, retail, warehousing. We announced I think this quarter or last -- end of last quarter USPS, American Express, Walmart just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they're trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on.
And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries. And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot and this is really, really exciting and it's called Edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is. But the industries now calls Edge AI. We're seeing a lot of excitement there.
And the reason for that is, you need to have low latency, inference. You might not be able to stream data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons and you need the response time. And so those four dynamics around AI really drove our growth. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Just following up on that. As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business now that you have the perspective of seeing what's driving the rebound any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us what happened there? And I guess as it pertains to the future do we think of this as a business that will have that kind of lumpiness to it? Yes. That's a really good question. In fact if you look backwards now we have the benefit of history. The deep recommendation systems, the natural language understanding breakthroughs, the conversational AI breakthroughs, all happened in this last year. And the velocity by which the industry captured the benefits here and continue to evolve and advance from these what so-called transformer models was really quite incredible. And so the all of a sudden the number of breakthroughs in AI has just grown tremendously and these models have grown tremendously.
Just this last week Microsoft announced that they've trained a neural net model in collaboration with the work that we did we call Megatron, increased the size's of the model from 7.5 billion parameters to 17.5 billion parameters. And the accuracy of their natural language understanding has just -- has really been boosted. And so the models are -- AI is finding really fantastic breakthroughs and models are getting bigger and there are more of them.
And when you look back and look at when these breakthroughs happened it essentially happened this last year. The second, we've been working on inference for some time. And until this last year very few of those inference models went into production. And now we have deep learning models across all of the hyperscalers in production. And this last year we saw really great growth in inference.
The third dynamic is public clouds. All these AI startups that are being started all over the world there's about 6,000 of them, they're starting to develop and be able to put their models into production. And with the scale out of AWS we now have T4s in every single geography. So the combination of the availability of our GPUs in the cloud and the startups and vertical industries deploying their AI models into production the combination of all that just kind of came together. And all of that happened this last year. And as a result we had record sales of V100s and T4s. And so we're quite excited with the developments and it's all really powered by AI. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on returning the business back to the strong growth. Jensen, I wanted to ask about how you are positioned from a supply perspective for this coming year? Your main foundry is running pretty tight. How will you be able to support the 20% or so growth here that many investors are looking for? If you could just give us some commentary on how you're positioned from a supply perspective that will be very helpful. Well I think we're in pretty good shape on supply. We surely won't have ample supply. It is true that the industry is tight and the combination of supporting multiple processes, multiple fabs across our partner TSMC. We've got a lot of different factories and a lot of different -- several different nodes of process qualified. I think we're in good shape. And so we just have to watch it closely. And we're working very closely with all of our customers and forecasting. And of course that gives us better visibility as well and -- but all of us have to do a better job forecasting and we're working very closely between our customers and our foundry partner TSMC. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Hi. Thanks. Colette, I'm wondering if you can give us -- in data center if you can give us a little idea of what the mix was between industries and hyperscale? I think last quarter hyperscale was a little bit less than 50%. Can you give us maybe the mix or how much it was up something like that? Thanks. Yes. Tim thanks for the question. Similar to what we had seen last quarter with all things growing as we moved into this quarter growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries and even in the cloud instances, we're still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. When I look at the numbers the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost 2x or north of 2x what we've seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter.
I'm just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework.
And Jensen just curious I mean as you think about the bigger picture where do you think we stand from an industry perspective today in terms of the amount or the attach rate of GPUs is for acceleration in the server market? And where do you think that might be looking out over the next three years or so? Thank you. Thanks Aaron. Colette do you want to go first? Sure. When we think about going into Q1 and our data center overall growth, we do expect to see continued growth both going into Q1. We believe our visibility still remain positive quite well and we're expecting that as we move into it and go forward. Yes. Aaron I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday. And at the very core of it most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it. Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries.
Whether it's shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question, the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down. And that filtering process is called recommendation. That recommendation system is really complex and deep learning is going to be involved in all that. That's the first thing. I believe that every query will be accelerated.
The second is as you know CPU scaling has really slowed and there's just no two ways about it. It's not a marketing thing. It's a physics thing. And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended. And it's called the end of Dennard scaling. And so there has to be another approach.
The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that's necessary to for every single query, but the benefit that comes along with that and the end of Dennard scaling suggests that there needs to be another approach and we believe that approach is acceleration.
Now, our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator. Notice we never say accelerator, we say accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs. The AIs will continue to evolve the models will continue to evolve and get larger and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable. It is one of the reasons why we've been so successful.
And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last three or four years around this area the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models, and the advances that these models are creating. And so we're seeing the beginning of a new computing era.
A fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It's going to require an accelerated computing platform and software richness is really vital so that these data centers could be software defined.
And so I think that we're in the early innings, the early innings, very, very early innings of this new future. And I think that accelerated computing is going to become more and more important. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Thank you very much. Good afternoon and obviously congratulations on the data center success. I wanted to ask a little bit Colette about the -- you took $100 million out for coronavirus, and I wanted to ask a little bit about how you got to that number. Really two pieces. One, if you could remind us, maybe in terms of units or revenue how -- what percentage of your gaming business is within China? And as you look at that $100 million that you put out of the guidance, are you thinking about that from a demand disruption perspective? Or are you thinking about it from something in the supply chain that might limit your sales? Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question Matt. So, it's really still quite early in terms of trying to figure out what the impact from the overall coronavirus maybe. So, we're not necessarily precise in terms of our estimate. Yes, our estimates are split between an impact possibly on gaming and data center, and split pretty much equally. The $100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or maybe overall demand. But we're still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be.
In terms of our business and our business makeup, yes, our overall China business for gaming is an important piece. We have about 30% of our overall China gaming as a percentage of our overall gaming business. For data center, it moves quite a bit. They are a very important market for us, but it moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on the overall end customer mix as well as the system builders that they may choose. So, it's a little harder to determine. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and guidance. On gaming -- yeah, no problem. Good to see the recent launch of your GeForce NOW service. But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world, so they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place. But how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership? Is it going to be deal your GeForce NOW hardware framework? Or will you just be supporting them with your standalone GPU products? And when do you expect the service to go mainstream? Let's see. Tencent is the world's largest publisher. China represents about a third of the world's gaming and transitioning to the cloud is going to be a long-term journey. And the reason for that is because Internet connection is not consistent throughout the entire market. And a lot of application still needs to be onboarded and we're working very closely with them. We're super enthusiastic about it. If we're successful long term, we're talking about an extra one billion gamers that we might be able to reach. And so, I think that this is an exciting opportunity just the long-term journey.
Now here in the West, we've had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the beta centers, the local hubs as well as people's WiFi routers at home. And so, we've been in data for quite some time as you know. And here at West our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now, and we're in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We're the only cloud platform that's based on Windows, and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud.
And so the reach is -- we've had more experience here in the West with reach and we've had -- we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I'm super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent. Overall, our GeForce NOW, you guys saw the launch, the reception has been fantastic. The reviews have been fantastic.
Our strategy has three components. There's the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don't have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I'm excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example like Tencent. And we offer them our platform of course and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the gaming side. If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you're looking for typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April. And I guess can you speak to that?
And then how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with recreation content becoming more available? How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then just really as a modeling question as part of gaming. With notebook now is third of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business? Thank you. Yes. So C.J., I want to go first and then Colette is going take it home here. So the first part of it is this, our gaming business has at the end -- I'm sorry. Okay. Our gaming business the end market demand is really terrific. It's really healthy. It's been healthy throughout the whole year. And it's pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic. And it's very -- it's super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have 30 -- over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting.
The second factor -- and one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it's now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world.
The second part of our business that is changing in gaming is the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business as Colette mentioned earlier, has seen double-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it's a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device.
And so the fact that we've been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook, a thin and light notebook is really a breakthrough. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing such great success in notebook.
Between the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It's more seasonal, because devices systems like notebooks and Switch are built largely in two quarters Q2 and Q3. And they build largely in Q2 and Q3, because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season.
And so that's one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks. I'm going to hand it over to Colette. Yeah. So with that from a background and you think about all those different components that are within gaming the notebook, the overall Switch and of course all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop, our normal seasonality as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those three pieces is usually sequentially down from Q4 sequentially down Q4 to Q1. This year the outlook assumes it will probably be a little bit more pronounced due to the coronavirus. So, in total, we're probably looking at Q1 to be in the low double-digit sequential decline in gaming. Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And good job on results and guide. On the same topic coronavirus. Colette, I'm a bit surprised that the guidance -- the range on the guidance is not wider versus historic. Can you just talk about why not widen the range? And what went into that $100 million hit from the coronavirus? So Atif, thanks for the question. Again, it's still very early regarding the coronavirus. Our thoughts are out with both the employees the families and others that are in China. So our discussions both with our supply chain that is very prominent in the overall Asia region, as well as our overall AIC makers, as well as our customers is as about as timely as we can be. And that went into our discussion and our thoughts on the overall guidance that we gave into our $100 million. We'll just have to see how the quarter comes through and we'll discuss more when we get to it. But at this time that was our best estimate at this time. Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I'd love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically NVIDIA's had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that's changed where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think is what it's called at the endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth? Yeah. Thanks a lot, Will. Let's see I think the -- historically inference has been a small part of our business because AI was still being developed. Deep learning AI is not -- historical AI, classical machine learning weren't particularly suited for GPUs and weren't particularly suited for acceleration. It wasn't until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary.
And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed. Eventually the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems these require instantaneous response. The faster the answer, the more likely someone is going to click on the answer.
And so you know that latency matters a great deal and it's measurable. The effect on the business is directly measurable. And so for conversational AI, for example, we've been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to -- for example fix the errors and such come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis. That entire pipeline could take several seconds.
We run it so fast that it's possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of 100 to 300 milliseconds. That is in the realm of interactive conversation. Beyond that it's just simply too slow. And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference moving to production. And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential now moving forward, I think you're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference.
The way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way. And the way that AI has evolved and deep learning, it suggests that acceleration on GPUs is just a really phenomenal approach.
Data centers are going to have to be software-defined. And I think as I mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier to another question, I believe that in the future the data center will all be accelerated. It will be all running AI models and it will be software defined and will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential.
As you move out to the edge, it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined whether it has to be programmable or whether it's fix functioned. There are many, many devices where the inference work is very specific. It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion. Those type of inference models are – could still be based on deep learning. It's function-specific. You don't have to change it very often, and you're running one or two models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective. I believe those AI chips, you're going to have AI chips that are $0.50, $1 and you're just going to put it into something and it's going to be doing magical detections.
The type of platforms that we're in, such as self-driving cars and robotics, the software is so complicated and there's so much evolution to come yet and it's going to constantly get better. Those software-defined platforms are really the ideal targets for us. And so we call it AI at the edge, edge computing devices. One of the edge computing devices, I'm very excited about is, what people call mobile edge or basically 5G telco edge. That data center will be programmable. We recently announced that we partnered with Ericsson and we're going to be accelerating the 5G stack. And so that needs to be a software-defined data center. It runs all kinds of applications, including 5G. And those applications are going to be – those opportunities are fantastic for us. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I guess, I had a question about your – how you think about the sustainability of your market position in the data center. And I guess in my simplistic view about 12 years ago you made out a consensus call to invest in CUDA software distribute it to universities. Neural networking took off and you were the de facto standard and here we are right now. And for me what's interesting to hear is that the demand that you're seeing today for your products is from markets that's just developed within the last year. And my question is like, how do you think about your investment your R&D investment strategy to make sure that you are staying way ahead of the market of the competition and even your customers who are investing in these markets too? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Our company has to live 10 years ahead of the market. And so we have to imagine where the world is going to be in 10 years time, in five years time and work our way backwards. Now, our company is focused on one singular thing. The simplicity of it is incredible. And that one singular thing is accelerated computing. Accelerated computing and accelerated computing is all about the architecture of course. It's about the complicated systems that we're in, because throughput is high.
When our acceleration we can – when we can compute 10, 20, 50, 100 times faster than the CPU, all of a sudden everything becomes a bottleneck. Memory's a bottleneck, networking's a bottleneck, storage is a bottleneck, everything is a bottleneck. And so we have to be – NVIDIA has to be a supremely good system designer. But the complexity of our stack which is the software stack above it is really where the investments over the course of the last – some 29 years now has really paid off.
NVIDIA frankly has been an accelerated computing company since the day it was born. And so we – our company is constantly trying to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate. Of course, computer graphics was an original one and we're reinventing it with real-time ray tracing. We have rendering, which is a brand-new application that we're making great progress in.
We just talked – I just mentioned 5G acceleration. Recently, we announced genomics computing. And so those are new applications that are really important to the future of computing. In the area of artificial intelligence, from image recognition to natural language understanding, to conversation, to recommendation systems, to robotics and animation, the number of applications that we're going to accelerate in the field of AI is really, really broad. And each one of them are making tremendous progress and getting more and more complex. And so the question about the sustainability of our company really comes down to two dimensions.
Let's assume for the fact – let's assume for now that `accelerated computing is the path forward and we surely believe so. And there's a lot of evidence from the laws of physics to the laws of computer science that would suggest that accelerated computing is the right path forward. But this really basically comes down to two dimensions. One dimension is, are we continuing to expand? Are we continuing to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate? Whether it's AI or computer graphics or genomics or 5G for example.
And then the number -- and then the second is those applications, are they getting more impactful and adopted by the ecosystem, the industry? And are they continuing to be more complex? Those dimensions, the number of applications and the impact of those applications and the evolution the growth of complexity of those applications, if those dynamics continue to grow, then I think we're going to do a good job. We're going to sustain. And so -- and I think when I spelled it out that way, it's basically the equation of growth of our company. I think it's fairly clear that the opportunities are fairly exciting ahead. Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jensen, I just wanted to ask you on the auto side. I think at least one of your customers might have slowed out their program. Just kind of curious as you look out the next couple of years, the challenges if the OEM is moving slower? And then just any perspective on the regulatory side has anything changed there would be helpful? Thanks. I think that the automotive industry is struggling, but for all of the reasons that everybody knows. However, the enthusiasm to redefine and reinvent their business model has never been greater. Every single one of them, every single one of them would know now and they surely -- they've known for some time and autonomous capabilities is really the vehicle to do that. They need to be tech companies. Every car company wants to be a tech company. They need to be a tech company. Every car company needs to be software-defined. And the platform by which to do so is an electric vehicle with autonomous autopilot capability. That car has to be software-defined. And this is their future and they're racing to get there.
And so although the automotive industry is struggling in near term, their opportunity has never been better in my opinion. The future of AV is more important than ever. The opportunity is very real. The benefits of autonomous is for whether it's safety, whether it's utility, whether it's cost reduction and productivity has never been more clear. And so, I think that I'm as enthusiastic as ever about the autonomous vehicles and the projects that we're working on are moving ahead. And so the near-term challenges of the automotive industry or whatever sales slowdown in China that they're experiencing, I feel badly about that. But the industry is as clearheaded about the importance of AV as ever. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks. We had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics and the market's response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming.
Our data center business is enjoying a new wave of growth powered by three key trends in AI natural language understanding, conversational AI, deep recommenders are changing the way people interact with the Internet. The public cloud demand for AI is growing rapidly. And as AI shifts from development to production, our inference business is gaining momentum. We'll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month's GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won't be disappointed. Thanks everyone.

Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may vary materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, May 21, 2020, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jensen. Thanks, Simona. Before Colette describes our quarterly results, I'd like to thank those who are on the front lines of this crisis, first responders, health care workers, service providers, who inspires every day with their bravery and selflessness. I also want to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our colleagues here at NVIDIA. Despite many challenges, they have barely broken stride during one of the busiest periods in our history.
Our efforts related to the virus are focused in 3 areas. First, we're taking care of our families and communities. We've pooled in raises by 6 months to put more money in our employees' hands, and NVIDIA and our people have donated thus far more than $10 million to those in need.
Second, we're using NVIDIA's unique capabilities to fight the virus. A great deal of science being done on COVID-19 uses NVIDIA technology for acceleration when every second counts. Some of the many examples, including sequencing the virus, analyzing drug candidates, imaging the virus at molecular resolution with cryo-electron microscopy and identifying elevated body temperature with AI cameras.
And third, because COVID-19 won't be the last killer virus, we need to be ready for the next outbreak. NVIDIA technology is essential for the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system, a system that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the spread of disease and continuously test and monitor.
We are racing to deploy the NVIDIA Clara computational health care platforms, Clara Parabricks can accelerate genomics analysis from days to minutes. Clara Imaging will continue to partner with leading research institutes to develop state-of-the-art AI models to detect infections, and Clara Guardian will connect AI to cameras and microphones and hospitals to help overloaded staff watch over patients.
We completed the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27. Mellanox is now NVIDIA's networking brand and business unit and will be reported as part of our data center market platform, and Israel is now one of NVIDIA's major technology centers.
The new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full-stack expertise in data center architectures and tremendous scale to accelerate innovation. NVIDIA Mellanox are a perfect combination and position us for the major forces shaping the IT industry today, data center scale computing and AI.
From micro service cloud applications to machine learning and AI, accelerated computing and high-performance networking are critical to modern data centers. Previously, a CPU compute node was the unit of computing. Going forward, the new unit of computing is an entire data center. The basic computing elements are now storage servers, CPU servers and GPU servers, and are composed and orchestrated by hyperscale applications that are serving millions of users simultaneously. Connecting these computing elements together is the high-performance Mellanox networking. This is the era of data center scale computing. And together, NVIDIA Mellanox can architect end to end. Mellanox is an extraordinary company, and I'm thrilled that we're now one force to invent the future together.
Now let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Jensen. Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe, we had a very strong quarter. Q1 revenue was $3.08 billion, up 39% year-on-year, down 1% sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms.
Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.34 billion was up 27% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. We are pleased with these results, which exceeded expectations in the quarter, marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19. Let me give you some color. Early in Q1, as the epidemic unfolded, demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period. As the virus spread globally, much of the world started working and learning from home, and gameplay surged. Globally, we have seen 50% rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform, driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user.
With many retail outlets closed, demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally. Gaming laptops revenue accelerated to its fastest year-on-year growth in 6 quarters. We are working with our OEMs, channel partners to meet the growing needs of the professionals and students engaged in working, learning and playing at home. In early April, our global OEM partners announced a record new 100 NVIDIA GeForce-powered laptops with availability starting in Q1 and the most to ship in Q2. These laptops are the first to use our high-end GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs, which have been available for desktop since last summer.
In addition, OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $999, a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX, including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities. These launches are well-timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate.
The global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA Nintendo Switch and our console business, driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft, the world's most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube. Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections. Light that reflects, refracts and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog. Reviews for it are off the charts. Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner, and PC World said it was glorious to behold.
Our RTX technology stands apart, not only with our 2-year lead in ray tracing but with its use of AI to speed up and enhance games using the Tensor Core silicon on our RTX class GPUs. We introduced the next version of our AI algorithm called Deep Learning Super Sampling. In real time, DLSS 2.0 can fill the missing bits from every frame, doubling performance. It represents a major step function from the original, and it can be trained on nongaming-specific images, making it universal and easy to implement.
The value and momentum of our RTX GPUs continue to grow. We have a significant upgrade opportunity over the next year with the rise and tide of RTX-enabled games, including major blockbusters like Minecraft and Cyberpunk. Let me also touch on our game streaming service, GFN, which exited beta this quarter. It gives gamers access to more than 650 games with another 1,500 in line to get onboarded. These include Epic Games, Fortnite, which is the most played game on GFN; and other popular titles such as CONTROL, Destiny 2 and League of Lighting in the fall. Since launching in February, GFN has added 2 million users around the world, with both sign-ups and hours of gameplays boosted by stay-at-home measures. GFN expands our market reach to the billions of gamers with underpowered devices. It is the most publisher-friendly, developer-friendly game streaming service with the greatest number of games and the only one that supports ray tracing.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue was $307 million, up 15% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated in Q1 driven by laptop workstations and Turing adoption.
We are seeing continued momentum in our ecosystem for RTX ray tracing. We now have RTX support for all major rendering visualization and design software packages, including Autodesk Maya, Dassault's CATIA, Pixar's RenderMan, Chaos Group's V-Ray and many others. Autodesk has announced that the latest release of VRED, its automotive 3D visualization software, supports NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This enables designers to take advantage of RTX to produce more like-life designs in a fraction of the time versus CPU-based systems. Over 45 leading creative and design applications now take advantage of RTX, driving a sustained upgrade opportunity for Quadro-powered systems while also expanding their reach.
We see strong demand in verticals, including health care, media and entertainment and higher education, among others. Higher health care demand was fueled in part by COVID-19 related research at Siemens, Oxford and Caption Health. Caption Health received FDA clearance for an update to its AI-guided ultrasound, making it easier to perform diagnostics-quality cardiac ultrasounds. And in media and entertainment, demand increased as companies like Disney deployed remote workforce initiatives.
Turning to automotive and robotic autonomous machines. Automotive revenue was $155 million, down 7% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. The automotive industry is seeing a significant impact from the pandemic, and we expect that to affect our revenue in the second quarter as well, likely declining about 40% from Q1.
Despite the near-term challenges, our important work continues. We believe that every machine that moves someday will have autonomous capabilities. During the quarter, Xpeng introduced the P7, an all-electric sports sedan with innovative Level 3 automated driving features, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. Our open, programmable, software-defined platform enables Xpeng to run its proprietary software while also delivering over-the-air updates for new driving features and capabilities. Production deliveries of the P7 with NVIDIA DRIVE begin next month.
Our Ampere architecture will power our next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE platform called Orin, delivering more than 6x the performance of Xavier Solutions and 4x better power efficiency. With Ampere scalability, the DRIVE platform will extend from driverless robotaxis all the way down to in windshield driver assistant systems sipping just a few watts of power. Customers appreciate the top-to-bottom platform all based on a single architecture, letting them build one software-defined platform for every vehicle in their fleet.
Lastly, in the area of robotics, we announced that BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA as a robotics platforms to automate their factories, utilizing logistic robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies.
Turning to data center. Quarterly revenue was a record $1.14 billion, up 80% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Announced last week, the A100 is the first Ampere architecture GPU. Although just announced, A100 is in full production, contributed meaningful to Q1 revenue and demand is strong. Overall, data center demand was solid throughout the quarter. It was also broad-based across hyperscale and vertical industry customers as well as across workloads, including training, inference and high-performance computing. We continue to have solid visibility into Q2.
The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over our 8 generations of GPUs, boosting performance by up to 20x over its predecessor. It is exceptionally versatile, serving as a universal accelerator for the most important high-performance workloads, including AI training and inference as well as data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.
Beyond its leap performance and versatility, the A100 introduces new elastic computing technologies that make it possible to bring rightsized computing power to every job. A multi-instance GPU capability allows each A100 to be partitioned into as many as 7 smaller GPU instances. Conversely, multiple A100 interconnected by our third-generation NVLink can operate as one giant GPU for ever larger training tasks. This makes the A100 ideal for both training and for inference. The A100 will be deployed by the world's leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.
We launched and shipped the DGX A100, our third-generation DGX and the most advanced AI system in the world. The DGX A100 is configurable from 1 to 56 independent GPUs to deliver elastic software-defined data center infrastructure for the most demanding workloads from AI training and inference to data analytics.
We announced two products for edge AI: the EGX A100 for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers; and the EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers. Supported by full AI optimized cloud, native and secure software, the EGX platform is built for AI computing at the edge. With the EGX, hospitals, retail stores, farms and factories can securely carry out real-time processing of the massive amounts of data streaming from trillions of edge sensors. NVIDIA EGX makes it possible to securely, deploy and manage and update fleets of servers remotely. EGX is also ideal for the massive computational challenge of 5G networks, which we are working on with our partners like Ericsson and Mavenir.
Additionally, we announced CUDA 11 and other important software harnessing the A100's performance and universality to accelerate three of the most complex and fast-growing workloads: recommendation systems, conversational AI and data science.
First, NVIDIA Merlin is a deep recommender application framework that enables developers to quickly build state-of-the-art recommendation systems, leveraging our pretrained models. With billions of users and trillions of items on the Internet, deep recommendators are the critical engine powering virtually every internet service.
Second, NVIDIA Jarvis is a GPU-accelerated application framework that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy and run end-to-end real-time conversational AI applications that understand terminology unique to each company and its customers using both vision and speech. Demand for these applications are surging. Amid the shift to working from home, telemedicine and remote learning.
And third, in the field of data science and data analytics, we announced that we are bringing end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark, an analytics engine for big data processing that uses more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide. Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark pipeline, from extracting, transforming and loading the data to training to inference, delivers the performance and the scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI. Adobe has achieved a 7x performance improvement and a 90% cost savings in an initial test using GPU-accelerated data analytics with Spark.
Our accelerated computing platform continues to gain momentum, underscored by the tremendous success of GTC Digital, our annual GPU technology conference, which shifted this spring to an online format. More than 55,000 online developers and AI research registered for the online event, which includes hundreds of hours of free content from AI practitioners and industry experts who leverage NVIDIA's platforms.
Our ecosystem is now 1.8 million developers strong. Times like these truly test a computing platform's metal in the utility it brings to scientist racing for solutions. Researchers around the world are deploying our GPU computing platform in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists are combining AI simulation to detect changes in pneumonia cases, sequence, the virus and seek effective biomolecular compounds for a vaccine or treatment.
The first breakthrough came from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and National Institute of Health, who used the GPU-accelerated application to create the first 3D atomic scale map of virus using NVIDIA GPUs. This was followed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who screened 8,000 compounds to identify 77 promising drug targets using the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit, which is powered by more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs.
The V100 GPUs at Oak Ridge are in high demand as they can analyze 17 million compound protein combinations in a day. They'll help understand the virus spread pattern, the University of California, San Diego, researchers ported their microbiomic analysis software to GPUs in the San Diego supercomputing cluster of 500x analysis speed up from what some people are more susceptible to the virus.
Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins was 65.1% and non-GAAP was 65.8%, up sequentially and year-on-year, primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $821 million, up 10% and 9% year-on-year, respectively. Q1 GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 130% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.80, up 105% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $909 million.
Before I turn to the outlook, let me make a few comments on our Mellanox acquisition. Beyond the strong strategic and cultural fit that Jensen has discussed, Mellanox has exceptionally strong financial profile. The company reported revenue of $429 million in its March quarter, accelerating to 40% year-on-year growth, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the mid- to high 60% range. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing.
With that, let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox. We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19. We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40% on a sequential basis and Pro Viz to decline sequentially. In gaming, while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores, we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-tail channels. Overall, the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict, given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy. Overall, we expect second quarter revenue to be $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%. The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue. We are providing this breakout to help with comparability between Q1 and Q2. But going forward, it will become an integrated part of our data center market platform.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are nonrecurring.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion, and $1.04 billion, respectively. The sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. For the full year, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs also influence.
GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an increase of approximately $50 million and $45 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
New this quarter, we have also posted an investor presentation summarizing our results and key highlights. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. Next Thursday, May 28, we will webcast a presentation and Q&A with Jensen on our recent product announcement moderated by Evercore. We will also be at Cowen's TMT Conference on May 27; Morgan Stanley's Cloud Secular Winners Conference on June 1; BoFa's Technology Conference on June 2; Needham's Fourth Automotive Technology Conference on June 3 and Nasdaq Investor Conference on June 16.
Operator, we will now open for questions. Can you please poll for questions, please. [Operator Instructions]. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Colette, I'm curious of your commentary around visibility in the data center side, that that's comments over the last couple of quarters, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to maybe what it was last quarter? And how do we think about the visibility in the context of trends maybe into the back half of the calendar year. Thanks, Will, for the question. You are correct. We have indicated a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see improved visibility after we came out of the digestion period in the prior overall fiscal year. As we move into Q2, we still have visibility and solid visibility into our Q2 results for overall data centers. So at this time, I'd say they are relatively about the same of what we had seen going into the Q1 period. And we think that is a true indication of their excitement about our platform and most particularly our excitement regarding A100, and that's launched and its additional products.
Now regarding the second half of the year, as you know, we have seen broad-based growth in both the hyperscale and the vertical industries, both of them in terms of at record levels. In our Q1 results. And we see in terms of inferencing continuing to grow as well, as well as we're also expanding in terms of edge AI. Our strong demand of the A100 products, including the Delta Board, but also in terms of our DGXs, was just starting an initial ramp. However, we do guide only 1 quarter at a time. So it's still a little bit too early for us to give a true certainty in terms of the macro situation that's in front of us. But again, we feel very good about the demand for A100. Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. I first wanted to follow-up on your gaming commentary. You sort of mentioned a couple of offsets. COVID potentially still a headwind, e-tail or tailwind and maybe offsetting each other. Were you trying to suggest that those did offset completely and gaming was kind of flattish into Q2? Because I know it has a typical seasonal pattern switches typically up. I guess what were you trying to say with those kind of factors? And what are the kinds of things we should be thinking about when it comes to seasonality, Colette, into Q2 around that business segment? So let me start, and I'll see if Jensen also wants to add on to it. I think you're talking about our sequential between Q1 and Q2. Some of the... Yes. That's right. Right. Some of the pieces that we had seen related to COVID-19 in Q1 may carry over into Q2. COVID-19, in fact, had an impact in terms of our retail channels as well as our iCafes. However, as we discussed, efficiently, moved to overall e-tail. We have normally been seasonally down in desktop between Q1 and Q2, and that will likely happen. But we do see the strength in terms of laptops and overall consoles as we move for Q1 to Q2. So in summary, we do expect grow sequentially between Q1 and Q2 for our overall gaming business. And I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has additional commentary. No, that was great. That was fantastic. Yes. I guess just to follow up on that, though, if it's growing. I mean like in prior years, we've seen it grow like very strong double digits. Obviously, the mix of the business was different back then. But do you think that the kind of -- I mean are we thinking kind of it's up somewhat? You don't -- is there any chance that it could be up like on -- for what we've seen in terms of like typical levels in the past? Like can you give us any sense of magnitude, that would be really helpful? Yes. I think when we think about that sequential growth, we'll probably be in the low -- moving up to probably the mid-single digits in terms of -- that's what our guidance right now, and we'll just have to see how the quarter goes. Yes. That's very helpful. Stacy, the thing that I would add is this. I would say, I think the guidance is exactly what Colette mentioned. But if you look at the big picture, there's a few dynamics that are working really well in our favor. First, of course, is that RTX and ray tracing is just the home run. Minecraft was phenomenal. We have 33 games in the pipe that has already been announced or shipping. Just about every game developers signed on to RTX and ray tracing, and I think it's a foregone conclusion that this is the next generation. This is the way computer graphics is going to be in the future. And so I think RTX is a home run.
The second, the notebooks that we create is just doing great. We got 100 notebooks in gaming. We have 75 notebooks designed for either mobile workstations or what we call NVIDIA studio for designers and creators. And the timing was just perfect. With everybody needing to stay at home, the ability to have a mobile gaming platform and a mobile workstation, it was just perfect timing. And then, of course, you guys know quite well that our Nintendo Switch is doing fantastic. There are the Top 3 games in the world. The top games in the world today are Fortnite, Minecraft and Animal Crossing. All 3 games are NVIDIA platforms. And so I think we have all the dynamics working in our favor. And then we just got to see how it turns out. Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to ask about the rollout of Ampere how quickly does that roll in the various segments between hyperscale as well as on the DGX side as well as on the HPC side. And is it a smooth transition? Is there -- I remember when you launched Volta, there was a little bit of a transitional pause. Just can you tell us how you see that ramping up with the different customer segments? Yes. Thanks a lot, Joe. So first of all, taking a step back. Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers. It wasn't the case when we first launched Volta. If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way, and it was really focused on training. It was focused on training and high-performance computing. We didn't come until later with the inference version called T4.
But over the course of the last 5 years, we've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers. If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive. Deep learning is now pervasive. The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense. It didn't used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric. But today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs. The number of workloads that we've accelerated since in the last 5 years have expanded tremendously, whether it's imaging or video or conversational AI or deep recommender systems that probably unquestionably, at this point, the most important machine learning model in the world. And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse.
And so that's really -- that's contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere. When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center, it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it. They have a large amount of workload that's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. And as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation. We're forward compatible or backwards compatible. Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100. And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth. On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter. It was sequentially up. And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment. A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business.
All the way out to the edge, which had a great quarter. Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it's a very small part of the high-performance computing. But that's also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers. And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown. The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion. And so I think we're ramping into a very receptive market with a really fantastic -- with a really fantastic product. Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Just a quick clarification. Colette, 66% kind of the new baseline for gross margin? And then the question, Jensen, for you, is give us a sense for how much inference as a workload and payer as a product are expected to contribute? I'm just curious where you are in terms of growing in the inference and edge AI market? And where are we kind of in the journey of Ampere penetration? So let me start on the first question regarding the gross margin and our gross margin as we look into Q2. We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%. This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that. The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox. Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well. But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward. However, it's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go. But we're very pleased with the overall guidance right now at 66% for Q2. Accelerated computing is just at the beginning of its journey. If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments. First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI. Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product. When you're watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song. All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend. All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today. It's the reason why they're collecting so much data. The more data they can collect, the more they could predict your preference, and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet.
It used to be largely based on CPU approaches. But going forward, it's all based on deep learning approaches. The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics. And so this is very, very big deal. And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping. Second is cloud. And as you know, cloud is a $100 billion market segment of it today, growing about 40% into $1 trillion opportunity. Cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen.
The two powers that is really -- the force -- the two forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing. We're perfectly, perfectly positioned to benefit from these two powerful forces. So the second is cloud computing. And that journey is -- has a long ways to go. Then the third is industrial edge. In the future, today -- it's not the case today. But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry. And whether it's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry. And there'll be trillions of sensors, and they'll be connected to little micro data centers. And those data centers will be in the millions. They'll be distributed all over the edge.
And that journey has just barely started. We announced 3 very important partners in 3 domains. And they're the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI. We announced Walmart for smart retail. We announced the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest mail sorting service and logistics service. And then we announced this last quarter, BMW, who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics, automated factory of the future. And so these 3 applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into. And that is just really at its early stages. And so I think it's fair to say that we're really well positioned in the 2 fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence. And the segments that it's going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets. Hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI. Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. I guess if I could ask two. Colette, can you help us with what you think the growth rate for Mellanox could look like in calendar '20? And then Jensen, a bigger picture question for you and really not specific to health care, more broad-based. But how do you think about the long-lasting impact of COVID on worldwide demand for AI? C.J., can you help me? You cut out in the middle of your sentence to me. Can you repeat the first part of it for me? No, sorry about that. I'm curious if you could provide a little handholding on what we should think about for growth for Mellanox in calendar '20? At this time, it's a little early for us. And as you know, we generally just go 1 quarter out, and we're excited to bring the Mellanox team on board so we can start beginning the future of building products together. For the overall margin, their overall performance over the last couple of quarters, they had a great last year. They had a great March quarter as well. And we're just going to have to stay tuned to see equally with them what the second half of the year looks for them. Okay? Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. This pandemic is really quite tragic, and it's reshaping industries and markets. And I think it's going to be structural. I think it's going to remain. And I think your question is really good because now it's a good time to think about where to double down. There's a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I say it, it'll be very sensible. The first is that the world's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud, that is going to accelerate. Every single company can't afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient. And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is going to provide them the resilience they need. And so that's one.
And when the world moves and accelerates into this $1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation, which is now $100 billion into that journey, it's growing 40% a year, I wouldn't be surprised to see that accelerate. And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that. The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system. The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar. And yet in the future, our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable. It's going to be infectious disease. And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods? And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company. We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day.
And that's what you need to do. You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP. And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring. And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up. National labs are going to be gearing up. The third part is AI and robotics. We're going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely. NVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs. And without those robots helping us in our labs, we'll have a hard time getting our work done. And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak. All kinds of robotics applications are being dreamed up right now to help society forward in the case of another outbreak.
And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people work from home, it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games. I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society. And so these are some of the trends, I would say. I would say cloud computing, AI. I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay. And these dynamics are really good for us. Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had one for Colette and then one for Jensen as well, if I may. Colette, I wanted to come back to the gross margin question. You're guiding July essentially flat sequentially, despite what I'm guessing is better mixed with non-ops coming in and automotive guided down 40% sequentially. I guess the question is, what are some of the offsets that are pulling down gross margins in the current quarter? And sort of related to that, how should we be thinking about the cadence and OpEx going forward, given the 6-month pull in that you guys talked about on the compensation side? And then one quick one for Jensen. I was hoping you could comment on the current trade landscape between the U.S. and China. I feel like you guys shouldn't be impacted in a material way directly nor indirectly. But at the same time, given the critical role you play in scientific computing, I can sort of see a scenario where some people may claim that you guys contribute to efforts outside of the U.S. So if you can kind of speak on that -- speak to that, that will be helpful. Thanks, Toshiya, for your question. So regarding our gross margins in the second quarter, our second quarter guide at 66% is up sequentially from even a record level in terms of what we had in terms of Q1. This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically, when we transition to a new architectures, margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the onset but tend to kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower. But also, we're going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles, which may offset those two. But overall, there's nothing structural to really highlight other than our mix in business and the ramp of Ampere and its transition. Let's see, the trade tension. We've been living in this environment for some time, Toshiya. And as you know, the trade tension has been in the background for coming up on a year, probably gotten longer. And China's high-performance computing systems are largely based on Chinese electronics anyhow. And so that's -- I think our condition won't materially change going forward. So Toshiya, let me respond to your second question that you had for me, which was regarding to our OpEx and our decision to pull forward our overall local into Q2. This is something that we've normally done later in the year. We felt it was prudent during the current COVID-19. Although our employees are quite safe. We just wanted to make sure that their family members also were safe and had the opportunity to have cash upfront. It is about a couple of months, about 4 months earlier than normal, and it is incorporated in our guidance for Q2. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. A question coming back to the A100. I'm trying to understand how this kind of fits into the evolution of your solution set over time and the evolution of the demand for the applications. Is -- and I guess if I think about it going back, you had a solution, which is largely training based. And then you kind of introduced solutions that were targeted more inferencing. And now you have a solution, it sounds to my understanding that it solves both inferencing and training efficiently. And so I guess I'm wondering is 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line, is this part of the kind of general purpose computing or acceleration framework that you had talked about in the past, Jensen, where Ampere is kind of like an Ampere-class product? Or is this -- would you still -- should we still expect to see inferencing-specific solutions in the market and then training-specific solutions and then an Ampere solution for a different class application? If you could provide a framework for thinking about Ampere in those context, I think that would be helpful. Yes. Thanks for the call, Mark. Good Question. I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it. There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time. The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training. Deep learning training. And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up. It's like a supercomputer architecture. It's like a -- it's like a weather simulation architecture. You're trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up.
And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms. And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs. And so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals. Cloud renting was really quite ideal. And then we started to get into inference, and we're on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0.
Along the way, we've been able to accelerate more and more. And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that's out there. And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called [indiscernible], reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day. It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks. And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine. Scale out, it's for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds. And so notice, I've said 3 different architecture in a data center today. Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100. And so the ability to predict workload is so hard, and therefore, the utilization of these systems will be spiky.
And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things. So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history. I mean I don't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x. And it's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward. The second, it's the first architecture that is unified. We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center. From data processing, it's called ETO; the engine, which many of you probably know, it's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data. It used to be Hadoop, but now it's Spark. Spark is used all over the world, 16,000 customers.
We finally have the ability to accelerate that. And then it's -- Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference. And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload. And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic. You could reconfigure it. You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs. Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta. I mean it's really quite extraordinary. And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it's elastic. You could use in the cloud, you could use a for inference, you could use it for training. And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about. And now you could have 1 acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs. That's very helpful. Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Actually I had two, I guess, Jensen, first for you. Just on the data center business, things have been very strong recently. Obviously, there's always concerns that customers are pulling in CapEx, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility into July. But I guess last time, most folks also thought that your kind of attrition really was so low that you would be immune into any digestion, but that wasn't the case. So I guess I'm wondering, if things are different now with A100 and whatnot, but my question is how do you handicap your ability to this time, maybe get through any digestion on the CapEx side? And then I guess, second question, Colette, stock comp had been running like 220 a quarter, and the guidance implies that it goes to like 460 a quarter. So it goes up a lot. Is that all executive retention? And is that sort of the right level as you look into 2021? Colette, did you want to handle that first? And then I'll do the... Sure. So let me help you out on the overall GAAP adjustments, so the delta between our GAAP OpEx and our non-GAAP OpEx. If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses. Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation. We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox, and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items. So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox. There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox. But for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for three quarters, which is influencing the stock-based compensation. Tim, there are several differences between our condition then and our condition today. So the first -- the first difference is the diversity of workload we now accelerate. Back then, we were early in our inference. We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning. And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video.
The natural language understanding the conversational AI to now a gigantic movement towards deep recommender systems. And so the number of different models that are being trained is growing. The size of the models are gigantic. Recommendation systems are gigantic. They're training on models that are hundreds. The data sizes, hundreds of terabytes. Terabytes, hundreds of terabytes. And it would take tens of -- hundreds of servers to hold all of the data that is needed to train these recommender systems. And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models. We didn't inference recurring elements at a time, which is probably the most important model today. Text language models, speech models are all recurrent, Euronet models. And so those models were early for us at the time. So number one is the diversity of workload. The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing.
I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition. From where we are today, it's only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry. It's going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting. We're also much more diversified out of the clouds. At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning. And today, hyperscale only represents about half. And so we've diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries. And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference. And as I mentioned earlier, we're working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so I think the conditions are a little different. And then what I would say lastly is Ampere. I mean we are -- we've ramped a few weeks. Even though it was quite significant, it was a great ramp. The demand is fantastic. It is the best ramp we've ever had. The demand is the strongest we've ever had in data centers. And we're starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp. And so -- those are some of the differences. I think the conditions are very different. Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Jensen, the team has showed the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, like, for example, when you guys move from Volta DGX-1 to Volta DGX-2, you guys didn't change the GPU chipset. But by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things, you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance per GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center skilled implementation, how does Mellanox' Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well? Yes. Great. Thanks a lot, Harlan. I appreciate the question. So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it's really successful. People love it. It's the most advanced AI instrument in the world. If you're a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument. And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have. And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking. High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand. And the reason for that is because the problems we're trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is. And so it has to be distributed.
And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable. There's reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind. And so -- and it's not just about the link speed. It's not mostly. I mean we just have a deep appreciation for software. It's a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design. And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class. And that's the reason why they're in 60% of the world's supercomputers. That's why they're in 100% of the AI supercomputers. And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none. Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up. And you're absolutely right. Now the question is why scale out? And the reason for that is this.
This is the reason why they're doing so well. The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center. That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes. And you could rank it however you desire. And these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it's a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center. And because it's broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again. And that's the reason why they're doing so well. By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously. And so it's the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter. It's the reason why they've been growing 27% per year.
And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they're low latency, they're incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it's Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases. And so they're -- it's a really fantastic stack. And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node. The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center. In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center. It's so incredible. It's just utterly incredible. You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center. And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security.
Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing. And so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch. And then the second thing is we'd like to be able to innovate across the entire stack. You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks. And the reason for that is because software creates markets. You can't create new markets like we're talking about, whether it's computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI. All of that requires software stacks. It takes software to create markets. And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that. They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack. And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers. And so we're super, super excited about the team. And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack. Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Jensen, I'd like to focus on something you said. I think it was in one of your earlier responses, you said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I'm sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely, let's say, REX and REXs CPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that? Yes. I appreciate the question. And this, for computer architecture geeks and people who follow history, you know well that in the entire history of time, there are only two computing architectures that has made it so far, which is one of them is x86. The other one's ARM in any reasonable way. And if you get an ARM computer, you get an x86 computer, you can program it. And in fact, there's no such thing as an accelerated computing platform until we came along. And today, we're the only computing -- accelerated computing platform that you could really largely address. We're in every cloud. We're in every computer company. We're in every country.
We have every single size, and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics. This journey took 20-some-odd years. Inside our company, it took 20-some-odd years. And the we've been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company. And we made a general purpose. We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg, C for graphics, and then it became CUDA. And we've been working on accelerated computing for quite a long time. And I think at this point, it's a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and is well beyond it. The number of developers this year that support -- that we supported was almost 2 million developers around the world, and it's growing what appears to be exponentially. And so I think accelerated computing is now well established. NVIDIA-accelerated computing is well established. It's common sense, and people who are designing data centers expect to put accelerated computing in it. The question is how much? How much accelerated computing do you use? And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it?
And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the three pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI. And the other two pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data. And so these three ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training. But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models. And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system. It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way. It's the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything. And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer's perspective.
On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there's no way they could possibly make money. And so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company. And that engine is gigantic. It is just a gigantic engine. And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics. The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference. So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies. And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is. But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration. And so I'm looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all the reasons that I just mentioned. Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. Just two quick ones. Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as OpEx, but just given the full year guide, there's sort of a lot to unpack. And you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there's an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there's Mellanox and how you're thinking about investing in that asset. I guess I'm just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on OpEx as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities? Or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you're thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well? How do I understand that? And then, Jensen, just a quick one for you. It kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like health care. But in the other verticals, has the sort of shelter in place kind of hurt engagement? And could we actually come out of COVID with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets? Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Let's start from the first perspective on the overall OpEx for the year. We've guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees. We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct. We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me, not this quarter, this year. And that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings, and you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly though, we are investing in our business. We see some great opportunities. You've seen some good results from our investment, and there's more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses. So there's nothing different structurally, but just this onset of Mellanox and are investing together, I think, we'll produce long-term great results. And as usual, John, you know that we're investing into the IT industry's largest opportunities, cloud computing and AI. And then after these 2 opportunities is edge AI. And so we're looking down the fairway with some pretty extraordinary opportunities. But as usual, we're thoughtful about the rate of investment, and we're well-managed. And NVIDIA's leadership team are excellent managers, and you could count on us to continue to do that. Simona, what was John's question? Could you just give me one hint? I haven't... Just the idea of engagement levels in verticals, just with shelter in place. Has that hampered... Oh yes. Right. Yes, right. Yes, right. A few -- some of the industries have been affected. We already mentioned automotive industry. The automotive industry has been grounded to a halt. Manufacturing hasn't largely stopped. And you saw that in our guidance. We expect automotive to be down 40% quarter-to-quarter. It's not going to remain that way. It's going to come back. And nobody knows what level is going to come back to you and how long, but it's going to come back. And there's no question in my mind that the automotive industry, they're hunkered down right now, but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. They have to, or they'll be extinct. It's not possible not to have autonomous capability in the future of everything that moves.
Not so that it could just completely drive without you. That a nice benefit, too. But mostly because of safety and comfort and just a joy of what seems like the car is reading your mind. And of course, you're still responsible for driving it and -- but it just seems to be coasting down the road, reading your mind and helping you. And so I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer, Tesla, is enjoying. And the industry is going to go after it. The future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies. And they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets. And so they're going to go after it. And so this is -- I'm certain that this is going to come back. And well, I have every confidence is going to come back. And let's see, the energy sectors are -- have been impacted. The retail sector has been impacted. There's -- those aren't large industries for us.
The impact in some of the industries is accelerating their focus in robotics. Like, for example, on the one hand, BMW has obviously impacted in manufacturing, which is the reason why they're moving so rapidly towards robotics. They have to figure out a way to get robotics into their factories. So same thing with retail. You're going to see a lot more robotic support in retail, you're going to see a lot more robotic support in warehouses, in logistics. And so during this time, when the market -- when the industry is disrupted and impacted, it allows the market leaders to really lean into investing into the future. And so when they come back, they'll be coming back stronger than ever. And your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Two different topics, Jensen. Well, first of all, congrats on Ampere. It's a heck of a product. The first question... Thank you, Matt. I'm so proud. The first question is it might have been a little bit hard to talk when the deal was pending about this topic, but now that it's closed, maybe you could talk a little bit about opportunities to innovate on and customize the Mellanox stack and the balance of having an industry standard. And the second one is E3 canceled, Computex moved around. At the same time, there's obviously stay-at-home gaming demand. Just how you think about gaming product, launch logistics? And any comments on there would be really helpful. Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt. I appreciate your questions. I'll go backwards because it's kind of cool. On the one hand, I do miss that we can't engage the developers face to face. It's just so much fun. GTC is doing all their work and the hundreds of papers that are presented, I learned so much each time. And frankly, I really enjoyed the analyst meeting that we have. And so there's all kinds of stuff that I missed about the physical GTC, but here's the amazing thing. We had almost -- the GTC kitchen keynote. I did it from my kitchen just right behind me, and the kitchen keynote has been viewed almost 4 million times. And the video is incredible. And so I think our reach is -- could be quite great. And so I'm not too -- we've got an amazing marketing team, and we just -- we've got great people. They're going to find a way to reach our gamers. And whenever we launch something next, you know that gamers are going to be and our customers are going to be -- our end markets are going to be really excited to see it. And so I'm very confident that we're going to do just fine. Matt, what was the question before? I should never do backwards. Just the industry standard versus customization of Mellanox opportunity. I see. Okay. Yes. There's -- we work so closely with Mellanox over the years. And on the day that we announced GTC, you could see the number of products that we have working together. The product synergies are really incredible, and the product synergies include a lot of software development that went in and a lot of architectural development that went in. DGX comes with 9 Mellanox, Matt, as I mentioned. If you look at our data center, we ship -- before we ship DGXs to the customers, we ship it to our own engineers. And the reason for that is because every single product in our company has AI in it. From Jarvis to Metropolis to Merlin to DRIVE to Clara to Isaac to -- right? All of our products has AI in it, and we're accelerating frameworks for all of the AI industry.
And Ampere comes with a brand-new numerical format called Tensor Float 32. And TF32 is just a fantastic medium medical format and the performance is incredible. And we had to get it integrated in with the industry standard frameworks. And now Tensor Float comes standard with Tensor Flow -- with TF -- NVIDIA TF32, and PyTorch come standard with TF32. And so we need our own large-scale data center. And so the first customer we ship to was ourselves. And then we started shipping as quickly as we could to all of the customers. You saw that in our data center, in our supercomputer. We have 170 -- 170 state-of-the-art, brand-new Mellanox switches. And almost 1,500 -- 200 gigabit per second Mellanox mix. And 15 kilometers of cables, fiber optic cables. And that is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world today, and it's based on Ampere.
And so we have a great deal of work that we did there together. We announced our first edge computer between us and Mellanox in this new card, we call it the EGX A100. It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox' CX-6 Dx, which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing. It's incredible security and has a single route of trust, and it's virtualized. And so basically, we -- this EGX A100, when you put it into a standard center x86 server, turns that server into a cloud computer in a box. The entire capability of a cloud, of a state-of-the-art cloud, which is cloud native, it's secure, it has incredible AI processing, it's now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box. The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable. And so you could see all the different product synergies that we have in working together. We could have done Spark acceleration without the collaboration with Mellanox. They worked on this piece of networking software called UCX. We worked on nickel together. It made possible the infrastructure for large-scale distributor computing. I mean just the list goes on and on and on. And so we -- the two teams have great chemistry. The culture -- it's a great culture fit. I love working with them. And right out of the chute, you saw all of the great product synergies that are made possible because of the combination. That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. It's coming. Let me just -- thank you. We had a great and busy quarter. With our announcements, we highlighted several initiatives. First, computing is moving to data center scale where computing and networking go hand in hand. The acquisition of Mellanox gives us deep expertise and scale to innovate from end to end. Second, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Our Ampere generation offers several breakthroughs. It is the largest ever generational leap 20x in training and inference throughput; the first unified acceleration platform for data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, training and inference; and the first elastic accelerator that can be configured for scale-up applications like training to scale-out applications like inference. Ampere is fast, it's universal and it's elastic. It's going to re-architect the modern data center. Third, we are opening large new markets with AI software application framework, such as Clara for health care, DRIVE for autonomous vehicles, Isaac for robotics, Jarvis for conversational AI, Metropolis for edge IoT, AERIAL for 5G and Merlin with the very important recommender systems. And then finally, we have built up multiple engines of accelerated computing growth. RTX computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and data center scale computing from cloud to edge. I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks, everybody. This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another extraordinary quarter. The world continued to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and most of our employees continue to work from home, but through the team’s agility and dedication, we successfully combined Mellanox into NVIDIA while also delivering a very strong quarter. Revenue was $3.87 billion, up 50% year-on-year, up 26% sequentially and well ahead of our outlook.
Starting with gaming, revenue was $1.65 billion, was up 26% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially significantly ahead of our expectations. The upside is broad-based across geographic regions, products and channels. Gaming’s growth amid the pandemic highlights the emergence of a leading form of entertainment worldwide. For example, the number of daily gamers on Steam, a leading PC game online distributor, is up 25% from pre-pandemic levels and NPD reported that U.S. consumer spending on videogames grew 30% in the second calendar quarter to a record $11 billion.
NVIDIA’s PCs and laptops are ideal for the millions of people who are now working, learning and gaming at home. At the outset of the pandemic, many retail outlets were closed and demand shifted to online channels. As the quarter progressed and the stores reopened, retail demand picked up, iCafes largely reopened and online sales continued to thrive. Gaming laptop demand is very strong as students and professionals turn to GeForce-based systems to improve how they work, learn, and game from home. We ramped over 100 new models with our OEM partners focused on both premium and mainstream price points. In the premium laptop segment, we delivered unparalleled performance with the GeForce RTX 2080 and the 2070 SUPER GPUs [indiscernible] form factors. We also brought ray tracing to gaming laptops for the first time at price points as low as $999 with the GeForce RTX 2060. In the mainstream segment, we brought the GeForce GTX to laptop price points as low as $699.
Momentum continues for our Turing architecture, which enables stunning new visual effects in games and is driving powerful upgrade cycle among gamers. Its RTX technology adds ray tracing and AI to programmable shading and has quickly redefined the new standard for computer graphics. DLSS used the AI capabilities of Turing to boost frame rates by almost 2x, while generating crisp image quality. RTX support in blockbuster games continues to grow, including Mega-Hit DEATH STRANDING, the highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and the upcoming release of Watch Dogs. These games join Minecraft and other major titles that support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS. We are in the midst of a 21-day countdown campaign promoting a GeForce special event on September 1, with each day highlighting a year in the history of GeForce. We don’t want to spoil the surprise, but we encourage you to tune in.
We are very pleased with the traction of our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service now in its second quarter of commercial availability. GFN offers the richest content to any game streaming service through partnerships with leading digital game stores, including Valve Steam, Epic Games and Ubisoft Uplay. GeForce NOW enables users with underpowered PC, Macs or Android devices to access powerful GPUs to play their libraries of PC games in the cloud, expanding the universe of gamers that we can reach with GeForce. Just yesterday, we announced that GFN is now supported on Chromebooks further expanding our reach into tens of millions of users. In addition to NVIDIA’s own service, GFN is available or coming soon to a number of telecom partners around the world, including SoftBank and KDDI in Japan, Rostelecom and Beeline in Russia, LG U+ in South Korea and Taiwan Mobile.
Moving to Pro Vis, in Q2 was $203 million in revenue, down 30% year-on-year and down 34% sequentially, with declines in both mobile and desktop workstations. Sales were hurt by lower enterprise demand amid the closure of many offices around the world. Industries negatively impacted during the quarter, include automotive, architectural engineering and construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment and oil and gas. Initiatives by enterprises to enable remote workers drove demand for virtual and cloud-based graphic solutions. Accordingly, our Q2 vGPU bookings accelerated increasing 60% year-on-year. Despite near-term challenges, we are winning new business in areas such as healthcare, including Siemens, Philips and General Electric and the public sector. We continue to expand our market opportunity with over 50 leading design and creative applications that are NVIDIA RTX-enabled, including the latest release from Foundry, Chaos Group, and Maxon. These applications provide faster ray tracing and accelerated performance, improving creators’ design workflows. The pandemic will have a lasting impact on how we work. Our revenue mix going forward will likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as NVIDIA laptops and virtual workstations that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.
Moving to automotive, automotive revenue was $111 million, down 47% year-over-year and down 28% sequentially. This was slightly better than our outlook of a 40% sequential decline as the impact of the pandemic was less pronounced than expected, with auto production volumes starting to recover after bottoming in April. Some of the decline is also due to the roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue, which remained a headwind in future quarters. In June, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz, which starting in 2024 will launch software-defined intelligent vehicles across an entire fleet in using end-to-end NVIDIA technology. Mercedes will utilize NVIDIA’s full technology stack, including the DRIVE AGX computer, DRIVE AV autonomous driving software and NVIDIA’s AI infrastructure spanning from the core to the cloud. Centralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and upgrade advanced software features as they are developed. With over-the-air updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending majority of ownership with each software upgrade. This is a transformator announcement for the automotive industry making the turning point of traditional vehicles becoming high-performance updatable data centers on wheels. It’s also a transformative announcement for NVIDIA’s evolving business model as the software content of our platforms grows positioning us to build a recurring revenue stream.
Moving to data center, data center is a diverse, consist of cloud service providers, public cloud providers, supercomputing centers, enterprises, telecom and industrial edge. Q2 revenue was a record $1.75 billion, up 167% year-on-year and up 54% sequentially. In Q2, we incorporated a full quarter of contribution from the Mellanox acquisition, which closed on April 27, the first day of our quarter. Mellanox contributed approximately 14% of company revenue and just over 30% of data center revenue. Both compute and networking within data center set a record with accelerating year-on-year growth. The biggest news in data center this quarter was the launch of our Ampere architecture. We are very proud of the team’s execution in launching and ramping this technological marvel especially amid the pandemic.
The A100 is the largest chip ever made with 54 billion transistors. It runs our full software stack for accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads. Our software leases include CUDA 11, the new versions of over 50 CUDA-X libraries and a new application framework for major AI workloads, such as Jarvis for conversational AI and Merlin for deep recommender systems. The A100 delivers NVIDIA’s greatest generational leap ever, boosting AI performance by 20x over its predecessor. It is also our first universal accelerator unifying AI training and inference and powering workloads, such as data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics, 5G services and graphics. The first Ampere GPU, A100, has been widely adopted by all major server vendors and cloud service providers.
Google Cloud platform was the first cloud customer to bring it to market making it the fastest GPU to come to the cloud in our history. And just this morning, Microsoft Azure announced the availability of massively scalable AI clusters, which are based on the A100 and interconnected with 200-gigabyte-per-second Mellanox InfiniBand networking. A100 is also getting incorporated into offerings from AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Tencent Cloud. And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world, including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch, with 30 systems expected this summer and over 40 more by the end of the year.
The A100 is already winning industry recognition in the latest A100 training benchmark, MLPerf 0.7 NVIDIA set 16 records, sweeping all categories for commercially available solutions in both per chip and outscale performance based on the A100. MLPerf offers the industry’s first and only objective AI benchmark. Since the benchmark was introduced 2 years ago, NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference. NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest TOP500 list of the fastest supercomputers. The ranking, released in June, showed that 8 of the world’s top 10 supercomputers use NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA’s networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S. and Europe. NVIDIA now combined with Mellanox powers two-thirds of the top 500 systems on the list compared with just less than a half for the two companies in total 2 years ago.
In energy efficiencies, systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they are nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs measured by gigaflops per watt. The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA’s own new Selene supercomputer, which debuted as number seven on the TOP500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier. Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than 4 weeks using NVIDIA’s open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years. This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks and it is a reference design that’s available for our customers to quickly build a world class supercomputer. We also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics, one of the largest and fastest growing enterprise workloads. We enabled end-to-end acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA’s GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June. Spark is the world’s leading data analytics platform used by more than 500,000 data scientists and 16,000 enterprises worldwide.
And we have two major milestones to share. We have now shipped a cumulative total of 1 billion CUDA GPUs and the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem just reached 2 million. It took over a decade to reach the first million and less than 2 years to reach the second million. Mellanox has fantastic results across the Board in its first quarter as part of NVIDIA. Mellanox revenue growth accelerated with strength across Ethernet and InfiniBand products. Our Ethernet shipments reached a new record. Major hyperscale build drove the upside in the quarter as growth in cloud computing and AI is fueling increased demand for high-performance networking. Mellanox networking was a critical part of several of our major new product introductions this quarter. These include the DGX AI system, the DGX SuperPOD clusters for our Selene supercomputer and the EGX Edge AI platform. We also launched the Mellanox ConnectX-6 Ethernet NIC, the 11th generation product of the ConnectX family and is designed to meet the needs of modern cloud and hyperscale data centers, where 25, 50 and 100 gigabyte per second is becoming the standard. We expanded our switch networking capabilities with the addition of Cumulus Networks, a privately held network software company that we purchased in June. Cumulus augments our Mellanox acquisition in building out open modern data center. The combination of NVIDIA accelerated computing, Mellanox networking and Cumulus software enables data centers that are accelerated, disaggregated and software-defined to meet the exponential growth in AI, cloud and high-performance computing.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 58.8% and non-GAAP gross margin was 66%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year and sequentially due to costs associated with the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by almost 6 points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales and lower automotive sales. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $1.62 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.04 billion, up 67% and 38% from a year ago, respectively. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.99, up 10% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 76% from the year ago. Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.57 billion.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus 2%. With that, we expect gaming to be up just over 25% sequentially, with data center to be up in the low to mid-single digits sequentially. We expect both pro vis and auto to be at similar levels out in Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.5% and 65.5% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.54 billion and $1.09 billion respectively. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx is tracking in line with our outlook of $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the BMO Virtual Technology Summit on August 25, Citi’s 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 9, Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference on September 14 and the Evercore’s Virtual Memo Forum, The Future of Mobility, on September 21. We will also host a financial analyst Q&A with Jensen on October 5 as part of our next virtual GTC. Our earnings call to discuss our third quarter’s results is scheduled for Wednesday, November 18.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Jensen, I am wondering how much of the strength that you are seeing in gaming and data center is maybe more temporary because of COVID or some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into hopefully sooner rather than later into a more normalized period for the industry? Yes, Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn’t see pull-ins and we are in the beginning of our brand new product cycle with Ampere and so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, with all that’s happening around the world and it’s really unfortunate but it’s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time – spending their time in videogames. The thing that people haven’t realized about videogames is that it’s not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you are spending time with your friends, you are using it to create to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people. And so – and then of course, it’s just an incredibly fun way to spend time even by consumption of the video – of a videogame. And so there is just so much that you could do with videogames now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don’t think it’s going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. And PC is now the single largest entertainment platform – is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it’s not just about gaming. There’s just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. With data center the things that – the structural change that’s happening in data center are coupled with different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud, the way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it’s really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It’s a type of software that really wants acceleration. And NVIDIA’s GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it. And then the last reason about the data center is the – this architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that’s driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. And so, because of this type of architecture, two components, two types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was – is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into this – in a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run. That transition is called east-west traffic. And the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that’s what Mellanox is fantastic at. And so, we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that’s why – that’s the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven. And that’s the benefit of our GPUs. And then, lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that’s where Mellanox comes in. And so, I think that this is – the dynamics that I am describing are permanent, and it’s just been accelerated to the present, because of everything that’s happening to us. But this is the future, and it’s not – there’s no going back. It’s – and we just found everything accelerated. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. Jensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you have been radical on that for some time. And when you have been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly picking that approach. So, I guess, the question is why do you think you won’t have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this, talk about you and ARM. So, I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU? Thanks. Yes. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system. But we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining it to Vivek just now that a microservice that we are enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. And so, the data center is running – the entire data center is running an application. I mean, that’s pretty remarkable thing. And that happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that, as a computing company, we have to be a data center scale company and we architect from that starting. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink, with eight processors being fully synchronized across the computing node, and we created the DGX. We recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that’s why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it’s GPUDirect or, recently, the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all in one holistic way. And then in the last – in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world’s first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world’s first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be one GPU or, with NVlink, 8 GPUs combined, working together. So you could think of them as being titled, so those 8 GPUs are working harmoniously together or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don’t need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so, whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes, create a larger GPU using NVLink, or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you would like. You made a comment about – you asked a question about ARM. We have been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it’s autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we are in. And then, recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so, we worked with the ARM team very closely. They are really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it’s incredibly energy-efficient. And because it’s energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so, anyways, we love working with the ARM guys. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just building on some prior questions. The first one, I was just curious if you could help us appreciate kind of the installed base of the gaming GPU business, relative to where we are at the Turing upgrade cycle, what do we see still on prior generations, be it Pascal or before? And then secondly, I was wondering, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How that – how has that changed over the last 3 months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year? Thank you. Yes. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are – we are still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we are in, is the world’s first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses – the RTX technology fuses three fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics, and we added two new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene – objects in scene super, super fast. And that’s – it’s a complicated problem. It’s a super complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that’s really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it’s even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it’s also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that’s called RTX. And Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we are in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they are going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it’s really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us. And then on the data center visibility? Yes. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you have seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we are still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It’s ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than a quarter of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Yes, hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess two questions. If I look at your outstanding inventory purchase obligations, grew 17% sequentially. Is that – as you prepare for the September 1 launch? And can you kind of comment on gaming visibility into the back half of the year? And then the second question, Jensen, I know you are very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. I would love to hear if there’s any particular platforms over the last 3 months where you have made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever. Thank you. Yes. Thanks so much, C.J. We are expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now, they are hanging out with friends. They are using it to create other content. They are using, game captures, create art. They are sharing it with the community. It’s a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described, require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems and – but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so, the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. And the second thing is that RTX, it’s a home run. We really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it’s really, really the next level. It’s not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so, for the last 15 years, we have been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there’s never been a giant leap like this. And RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. And then the third factor is the console launch. There’s – people are really – the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And because of the gaming – because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home, I think it’s going to be the most amazing season ever. We are already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has – about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom. I mean – which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean, they are on their way to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so, I am super excited for them. And so, I think it’s going to be quite a huge second half of the year. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Colette, I felt like I didn’t – I missed C.J.’s second question. Can we jump on and answer it? I think your – I think the question was regarding our inventory purchases on that piece. Is that the part that you are referring to? Yes, that’s the one. Yes. Yeah. Keep in mind, C.J., that when you think about the complexity of the products that we are building, we have extremely long lead times, both in terms of what we produce for the data center, our full systems that we need to do, as well as what you are seeing now between the sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 for overall gaming. So, all of that is in preparation for the second half. Nothing unusual about it other than, yes, we have got to hit those revenue numbers that are in our Q3 guidance. Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman and Sachs. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking the question. I had one for Jensen and another one for Colette. Jensen, just following-up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next call it, 6 to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess the breadth that you have built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months? And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins, you are guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what’s driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter? Thank you. Yes. Thank you. So and thanks for the question. The – our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence in all the services are – that are in – by the cloud service providers. And I think it’s fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we are seeing anywhere from 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so, in the last three years, we have seen somewhere between 1,000x to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. And so, the.1 trend that we are – we are probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the – and I remember C.J.’s question now, and I’ll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how – what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand. And there are three big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding. The ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it’s called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos and there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to – that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous. And so, the first one is natural language understanding, the second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean, we are going to have conversational engines that are just super clever. And they can predict what you’re about to ask. They’re going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the three pillars that I just described. And I haven’t even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate. And breakthroughs that we’re seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so, the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we’re indexed to AI. The second, we’re indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. And then the third thing that we’re indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I have just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. NVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal. And these three facts that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based, and scale-up-based. And so, these – bare-metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it’s one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they are at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they are at the intersection of all of that. And I just described three dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we’re really indexed to. And then lastly, when somebody adopts – when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we are in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It’s the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it’s – it reduced – it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so, we’re in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we’ve ever had. And so, we are going to keep on racing through the second half. Okay. And, Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix, but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So, keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter over quarter for our overall console shipments. We are going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into data center a little bit. This is a question for Colette. So, in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what’s driving the trajectory? Are you more demand- or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you’d have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now? Yes. Stacy, so thanks for the question. Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we’re seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we are very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that’s how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it’s not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100, T4. And we are also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So, I hope that helps you understand our statements on where we are at in terms of the Q3 guidance. We will see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more to that. Well, when we are ramping, we sure love to have more and sooner. And – but this is our plan, and we are executing to the plan. It is a very complicated product, as Colette mentioned. It is the most complicated. Got it. Got it. And just a quick follow-up, within the data center guidance, how do you think about like the core data center sequential growth versus Mellanox? Yes. So, in terms of moving from Q2 to Q3, we believe that most of the actual growth that we will receive in that single – low single-digits to mid-single-digit growth will likely stem from NVIDIA compute will be the largest driver of that. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask a longer-term question about the – how you guys see the importance of process technology. There’s been a lot of discussion around that in the CPU domain. But you guys haven’t really felt the need to be first on seven-nanometer, and you have done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA? Yes. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, alright? And so, process technology we have a really awesome process engineering team. World-class. Everybody will recognize that it’s absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that is ideal for us. It’s a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. Then the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We are paid for architecture. And there’s a vast difference between our architecture and the second-best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the – in the transistor side. And so, it must be more complicated than that. And so, we put a lot of energy into that. And then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it’s really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you’re a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what’s underneath it, nor do you care. And so, what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are lot of code in there. And so, what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world’s best processors, and we use the world’s best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world’s best packaging. We’re the world’s first user of cobots. And whether it’s – I think we are– I’m pretty sure we are still the highest volume by far of 2.5D and 3D packaging. And so, we start from a great chip. We start from a great chip, but we don’t end there. That’s just the beginning for us. Now we take this thing all the way through systems, the system software, algorithms, networking, all the way up to the entire data center. And the difference is absolutely shocking. we built our data center, Selene, and it took us four weeks. We put up Selene in four weeks’ time. It is the seventh-fastest supercomputer in the world, one of the fastest AI supercomputers in the world. It’s the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world, and it broke every single record in MLPerf. And that kind of shows you something about the scale that we work and the complexity of the work that we do. And this is our – the future. It’s for – the future is about data centers. We have no further questions at this time. Jensen Huang, I turn the call back over to you. Thank you. The accelerated computing model we pioneered has clearly passed the tipping point. Adopting of NVIDIA computing is accelerating. On this foundation and leveraging one architecture, we have transformed our company in three dimensions. First, NVIDIA is a full-stack computing platform company, offering the world’s most dynamic industries, the chips systems, software and libraries like NVIDIA AI to tackle their most pressing challenges. NVIDIA – second, NVIDIA is a data center-scale company with capabilities to architect, build and operate the most advanced data centers. The data center is the new computing unit. With this capability, we can create modern data center architectures that are computer maker partners, and then scale out to the world’s industry. Third, NVIDIA is a software-defined company today, with rich software content like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA virtual workstation in the cloud, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Drive that will add recurring software revenue to our business model. In the coming years, AI will revolutionize software. Robotics will automate machines, and the virtual and physical worlds will become increasingly integrated through VR and AR. Industry advancements will accelerate, and NVIDIA-accelerated computing will play an important role. Our next GTC will be coming on October 5, again from my kitchen. Join me.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter with revenue exceeding $5 billion, and year-on-year growth accelerating to 61%. Full year revenue was also a record at $16.7 billion up 53%. Our gaming business has reached record revenue of $2.5 billion in Q4, up 10% sequentially, and up 67% from a year earlier. Full year gaming revenue was a record at $7.8 billion, up 41%. Demand is incredible for our new GeForce RTX 30 Series products based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In early December, we launched the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which joined the previously launched RTX 3090, 3080, and 2070. The entire 30 Series lineup has been farmed to keep in stock and we exited Q4 with channel inventories even lower than when we started.
Although we are increasing supply, channel inventories will likely remain low throughout Q1. GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards were a holiday sensation do not just do their amazing performance, but also to the rich features, including our second generation RTX ray tracing technologies and DLSS AI powered performance accelerator, which massively boost frame rates in graphically demanding titles, 3,000 games now support RTX, including the top Battle Royale game, Fortnite the top roll playing game, Cyberpunk 2077, the top massively multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft, and the best selling game of all time, Minecraft.
RTX has clearly set the new standard in gaming. Building on this momentum at CES in January, we introduced a wave of Ampere architecture gaming products, including our biggest ever laptop launch powered by GeForce RTX 3060, 3070, and 3080 laptop GPUs and with our third generation MAXQ technology. These new thin and lightweight gaming laptops increased performance to energy efficiency by up to 2x from the prior generation. RTX 3060 laptops start $999 and are faster than the previous generation laptops, which sold for $2,500. The incredible performance, design and price points of these new laptops will delight the growing universe of gamers and creators as well as students and professionals.
The gaming laptop market has grown seven fold in the past seven years and momentum is building. With top OEMs bringing to market a record 70 plus laptop models based on the GeForce RTX 30 series. GeForce laptops as a whole are the fastest growing and one of the largest gaming platforms. Also at CES, we announced the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU priced at $329 extending the 30 series desktop liner further into the mainstream. We expect strong demand when it launches this Friday as 60-class GPUs have traditionally been our most popular products. Starting with the 3060, we're taking an important step to maximize the supply of GeForce GPUs for gamers. Users are constantly discovering new applications for our powerful programmable GPUs and cryptocurrency mining is one of them.
With rising Ethereum prices, there are indications that minors are behind GPUs. We would like GeForce GPUs to end up with gamers. So we have created new special software drivers that will detect the Ethereum mining algorithm cutting in half the mining efficiency of the GeForce RTX 3060. We suspect the significant increase in the Ethereum network hash rate observed over the past few months was driven by a combination of previously installed mining capacities that was reactivated as well as new sales of GPUs and ASICs. Since our GPUs are sold to graphics card manufacturers and then onto distribution, we don't have the ability to accurately track or quantify their end use.
Analyst estimate suggest that cryptomining contributed 100 million to 300 million to our Q4 revenue were relatively small portion of our gaming revenue in Q4. Cryptocurrencies have recently started to be accepted by companies and financial institutions and show increased signs of staying power to address – to address industrial Ethereum mining demand, last week we announced a new line of NVIDIA CMPs or crypto mining processors. Shipments will start in March. CMPs lack display outputs and have other optimizations that improve crypto mining power efficiency. CMP products will let us gain some visibility into the contribution of crypto mining to our overall revenue.
For Q1, we estimate that CMP will contribute approximately 15 million. We plan to sell these products to industrial miners. We will quantify their contribution each quarter for transparency. Over the past year, it's become clear that we've entered a new era in which gaming is an integral part of global culture. The number of concurrent users on Steam has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to hit new records. In 2020 alone more than 100 billion hours of gaming content was seen on YouTube and half a billion people watched e-sports. Increasingly, we aren't just gaming. We're also watching sports, attending concerts, creating content and connecting with our friends in virtual environments.
Additionally, we are excited about the new experiences like beyond significantly more content is now available, including arguably the first VR killer app [indiscernible] and there is now almost 2 million VR users on Steam. And with these powerful structural shifts, we expect our gaming business to remain on a robust growth trajectory. The GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs have kicked off a powerful upgrade cycle and we estimate only around 15% of GeForce gamers on an RTX cost GPU, which is needed to experience the beautiful rate trace graphics of modern games. Moreover the universe of gamers is rapidly expanding and the reach of GeForce has extended beyond gamers to some 45 million creators.
In addition, gaming revenue continues to benefit from a favorable mix shift as gamers and creators keep moving to higher end GPUs, we expect another great year for GeForce. Earlier this month, we celebrated the one year anniversary of the GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform, which is now over 6 million members strong. GeForce now offers 800 PCs from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud gaming service including any of the most played free to play games, starting with support for windows PCs, Macs, and Android devices we added support in recent months to Chromebooks, iPhones and iPads. GFN has grown globally with more than 65 countries on our service and more – added regularly by our GeForce NOW alliance partners.
Moving to Pro Vis, Q4 revenue was $307 million, up 30% sequentially and down 10% year-on-year and ahead of our expectations full year revenue was $1.1 billion was down 13%. Strong sequential growth was driven primarily by a recovery in desktop workstations as some customers returned to the office and enterprises resumed purchases that had been deferred by the pandemic. Notebook GPUs grew sequentially to a record as enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Looking ahead, the reopening of businesses will benefit desktop workstations, but longer-term workforce trends will likely shift our mix to notebook GPUs and cloud offerings. Healthcare was a standout vertical in the quarter with significant orders from GE Siemens and Oxford Nanopore technologies, public sector and automotive also so strength. Omniverse are real time 3D collaboration and simulation platform is now an open beta. Over 500 creators and professionals have tested Omniverse through our early access program. Omniverse is one of our most important and exciting platforms. We are divided by its initial acceptance and look forward to sharing more details on its long-term growth opportunity in the coming months.
Moving to Automotive; Q4 revenue was $145 million, up 16% sequentially and down 11% year-on-year. Full year revenue of $536 million, declined 23%. Sequential growth was driven by continued recovering in the global automotive production volumes and growth in AI cockpit revenue. Year-on-year decline reflects the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment. Nvidia has emerged as the industry's leading end-to-end full stack technology provider for self-driving and AI enabled vehicles or in the SOC that drive self-driving platform is built on delivers an unrivaled 254 trillions of operations per second of performance on industry leading power efficiency, helping to revolutionize the transportation industry.
Our technology leadership has driven a robust rapidly growing set of opportunities. We have great momentum with an expanding list of electric vehicle OEMs, including NIO, SAIC, Li Auto and Xpeng which are all using the Nvidia drive platform to power their next generation of vehicles. We look forward to growing with them as they continue to scale.
Our software defined platforms is the only solution that spans from the data center for training deep neural net and running physically accurate simulations to a full stack in car solutions scaling for ADAS to Level 5 fully autonomous functionality. Autonomous vehicle companies are harnessing this technology. Zoox recently unveiled its Level 5 bi-directional robotaxi powered by Nvidia, and wide launched its next generation countless autonomous truck using NVIDIA Drive Orin.
And earlier this year, Mercedes announced a 56-inch wide MBUX Hyperscreen powered by Nvidia AI cockpit technology. This will builds on our momentum with Mercedes first-generation MBUX system, which is now in 1.8 million cars. We are in the early innings of a significant opportunity. We have built a multi-billion dollar design win pipeline for our self-driving the AI cockpit solutions, which will drive a material inflection in revenue over the next few years. Our transformational partnership with Mercedes announced last June demonstrates the power of our evolving business model as we expand our addressable market and layer in software revenue. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity that lies ahead.
Moving to data center; revenue was $1.9 billion, which exceeded our expectations was comparable to last quarter and up 97% from the year ago period, which did not include Mellanox. Data center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full year data center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from data center compute. From a sequential perspective, the data center computes stronger than expected double-digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large non-reoccurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3. Compute growth was lead by vertical industries where OEM partners continued ramping up their 100 – day 100 base servers and our own DGX system sales were strong.
Vertical industries were well over 50% of data center revenue across compute and networking with particular strength in super computing, financial services, higher education and consumer internet verticals. Additionally, hyperscale customers continued to deploy the A100 driving both sequential growth and exceptionally strong year-on-year growth in data center compute. The A100 has been adopted by all major cloud customers globally and is being deployed by hyperscale customers for internal workloads. Still we are in the early stages of adoption and expect continued growth this year. The ramp of the A100 has been smoother and accomplished by better visibility than prior generation. It's universal AI training and inference capabilities as well as support for wider set of applications and outstanding performance are driving five customer utilization; a clear sign of the A100's value.
Turning to Mellanox. We are seeing continued strong traction and robust momentum across our customer set. Its revenue was up over 30% from Mellanox's Q4 revenue in calendar 2019 when it was still a standalone company. Year-on-year growth in the quarter was led by hyperscale and large consumer internet customers, which grew over 60% from last year with several contributing record revenues. Consistent with our outlook Mellanox had a sequential decline impacted by a non-reoccurring sales to a China OEM in Q3.
We expect to return to sequential growth in Q1 driven by strong demand for our high speed networking products, including the ramp of ConnectX adapters with CSPs and all major server OEMs in their upcoming refresh. We also see strong momentum in high-performance computing with HDR InfiniBand products. For example, we won six of the seven supercomputers awarded over the past few months by Euro HPC. Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide color on networking as part of the data center market platform, but we will no longer break out Mellanox revenue separately.
Looking forward, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities and data center. Accelerated computing is not only delivering super more loss, gains and performance but there's also an energy efficient and cost effective method of computing and virtually every industry is adopting technology with greater urgency as companies adapt to the new world of more distributed workers and customers. As industries embark on this journey, they are also increasingly focused on combating climate change. To that end, the A100 performed AI computations with one-twentieth the power consumption of CPU's. And powers are saline supercomputer, which is number one on the Green500 list of the world's most efficient supercomputers. Indeed Nvidia's powered machines recently captured 25 of the top 30 spots on the Green500 list. Accelerated computing is not only serving the exponential growth and demand for compute; it can also help bend the power consumption curve. With accelerated computing Nvidia is pioneering a [indiscernible] forward the computing industry.
Before I moved to the P&L and outlook, let me give you an update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. In September, we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank Group and a transaction that will create the premier computing company for the age of AI. At that time, we said it would take approximately 18 months to secure regulatory approvals in the U.S., the UK, the EU, China and other jurisdictions. Thorough reviews are typical with the deal of this size. This process is moving forward as expected. We are in constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities and are confident that regulators will see the benefits to the entire tech ecosystem. As we have said, this combination will spur competition together Arm and Nvidia will provide greater choice to the data center ecosystem, a compelling alternative CPU architecture for the market and further enhance Arms' offering in mobile and embedded.
Our intention is to increase investment in Arm's existing roadmap, adding resources to stimulate growth in new markets. We love and intent to maintain Arm's open licensing model, a commitment guaranteed both by long-term legally binding contracts, as well as our own interest in ensuring this investment is a profitable one for us. We are on the cusp of new age in which AI fuels industries ranging from healthcare to scientific research to the environment. With this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential, so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins were 63.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 65.5%. GAAP gross margins declined year-on-year due to amortization of developed technology acquired from Mellanox, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was due to higher margins for gaming GPU and lower IP related costs, partially offset by lower margin mix in our data center portfolio. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 10 basis points year-on-year and was flat sequentially in-line with our expectations. Q4 GAAP EPS was $2.31, up 51% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.10, up 64% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was a record $2.07 billion.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Revenue is expected to be $5.3 billion plus or minus 2% with most of the sequential growth driven by gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.8% and 66% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.67 billion, and $1.2 billion respectively. For the full year we expect to grow non-GAAP OPEX in the mid-20% range. GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an extent of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending to Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference on March 1st. The Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 3rd; and the Arete Virtual Semis Conference on March 3rd. In addition, we will be hosting a virtual Investor Day on Monday, April 12th following a live stream of Jensen's opening keynote at our GPU Technology Conference. Our earnings call to discuss our first quarter and full – our first quarter is scheduled for Wednesday, May 26.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Jensen, higher level question for you on the enterprise side; you're now a couple of quarters into the ramp of A100. I am curious if you could speak to whether you've seen any surprises here, any areas of specific strength worth calling out? And any changes to how you're thinking about the size of this opportunity? Yes. Thanks a lot. It's Jensen. As you know A100 is a very different type of GPU. This is our first universal computing GPU. It's great at high-performance computing. It's great at data analytics, it's great at training and also for our highest GPU is also the first time that is incredible for inference. It's some 20 times faster than previous generation. We may introduce this some really exciting new computational formats like TF32, TensorFloat-32 for training. And with a multi-instance GPU, turning our GPU 1, GPU to a whole bunch of smaller GPUs – autonomous GPU to improve performances and reducing latency.
And so the capability is really quite exciting. We're seeing straight in hyperscalers as they continue to accelerate their adoption of AI. Some of the new applications we've spoken about a couple of times before, the transition to deep learning, the conversational AI, speech recognition to natural language understanding all the way to speech synthesis, which is now based on AI – based on deep learning. The other area that's growing incredibly fast is the deep learning recommender models. That's just about everything that you do on the Internet is based on recommenders. There are hundreds of different recommenders out there, whether you're shopping or recommending music or recommending news or recommending search and so all of the recommending ads, and so all of these different types of applications are driving down.
For the first time we saw our industrial application or industrial data center growing to be larger than hyperscale. And we're seeing industrial applications across scientific computing where simulation based approaches are now being fused with AI approaches for weather simulation, genomics, molecular dynamics simulation, quantum chemistry, even simulating quantum computing, which is one of the really exciting areas.
We're seeing AI being deployed for big data analytics rapid, which is Nvidia has created open source platform for data analytics of Spark 3.0, which Nvidia really led and as now GPU accelerated. So now you could have big data in the cloud, while doing big data analytics in the cloud on all of the CFT platforms. And you could – we're seeing a lot of excitement around financial services and consumer internet services are all really growing nicely. And so A100 is the adoption is just starting, I mean, we're going to see several – couple of years of continued growth ahead of us, while as AI gets adopted in clouds and industries. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification and then a question for Jensen. On the clarification, Colette, I was hoping if you could give a little more color around Q1? Do you still expect data center to grow sequentially in Q1? I know you said that most of the growth will come from gaming, but any color on the data center would be useful?
And then Jensen the question for you, in your press release you use the phrase AI driving the smartphone moment for every industry. Could you help us quantify what that means and where I'm going with that is, is there a number in terms of what percentage of servers are shipping today with your accelerators, and where can that ratio go overtime? Is that a fair way of looking at the adoption of your technology and AI? So thank you, Vivek. Your question regarding the guidance as we beat into Q1. We had indicated that yes, a good percentage of our growth between Q4 and Q1 those come from gaming, but we also do expect data center to grow. Most of our sequential growth coming from gaming, but keep in mind we also expect all of our markets platforms will likely be able to grow quarter-over-quarter. Vivek Arya, we are entering the third phase of AI. The first phase of AI was when we invented the computing platforms, the new chips, the new systems, the new system software, the new middleware, the new way of working, the new way of developing software, which the industry, the world is now starting to call MLOps. The way that software is developed and the way that is deployed is completely different in the past. In fact I heard a great term Software 2.0, and it makes a lot of sense. It's a computer that is writing software. The way that you develop software is completely different; the way you compute is different. And that was our first phase, and that that started in a journey that was some eight, nine years ago now.
The second phase was the adoption of using this in an industrial way for clouds. And we call it revolutionized services; whether it's speech oriented services or searching oriented services, recommended services, the way you shop, the way you use the internet is completely different today. And so that's really the second phase and those two phases are still continuing to grow, and you're still seeing the growth associated with that.
The third phase is the industrialization of AI and some of the great examples when I say in terms of smartphone moment, I meant that it's a device with AI, its autonomous and it's connected to a cloud service, and it's continuously learning. So some of the exciting example that I saw, that I've seen and we're working with companies all over the world, we have some 7,000 AI startups we're working with, and almost all of them are developing something like this. And large industrial companies whether it's John Deere or Walmart, they're all developing application [indiscernible].
And basically it's an autonomous system, autonomous machine. In our case it's called Jetson, it's a robotics machine. That robotics machine is a car, then its call DRIVE and it's running an autonomous, an AI application on top and AI's skills on top. And it could be – it could be moving things around, it can be picking and placing. It could be just watching a warehouse and monitoring traffic and keeping traffic flow going. It could be connected to a car. And whenever the car – whenever the fleet of cars needs to be retrained because of the new circumstance was discovered the cloud service will do the relearning and then was deployed into all of the autonomous devices.
And so in the future, we're seeing these industries, whether you're in retail or in logistics or transportation, or farming, ag tech to lawnmowers – consumer lawnmowers. They're not going to just be products that you buy and use from that point forward, but it likely be a connected device with an AI service that runs on top of it. And so these industries I'm so excited about because it gives an opportunity to change the way that they interact with their customers. Rather than selling something once, they sell something and provide service that's on top of it. And they can stay engaged with the customers. The customers could get a product that's improving all of the time, just like your smartphone. And that's kind of like – that's kind of the reason – that's the reason why I've been calling it a smartphone moment for all these industry.
And we saw what happened to the smartphone revolution. And then we saw what happened to the smart microphone, the smart speaker revolution, and you're going to see smart lawnmowers, smart tractors, smart air conditioners, smart elevators, smart building, smart warehouses, robotic retail storage and entire store – the entire retail store is like a robot. And they will all have autonomous capability that are being driven by AI. And so what’s new for the industry therefore. Is that all if the enterprises in the world use to have computers for IT to facilitate our employees and their supply chain. But in the future, all of these industries whether in medical imaging or lawnmowers, you're going to have data centers that are hosting your products just like the CSP.
And so that's a brand new industry and we have a platform that we call EGX, which is the 5G Edge AI systems. And we have the autonomous systems we call AGX, which is what goes into adjusting and drives. And between those two systems and the software stack that we have on top of it we're in a great position to help these industries one at a time transformed their business model from a object oriented business model, a thing based business model to a connected device. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, I don't want to be pedantic, I suppose, but I guess on the Q1 guide, you say the gaming is the majority of the growth. Was that an absolute statement or was that a percentage statement? Can you give us some idea of how you'd sort of rank the sequential percentage growth of say gaming versus data center versus other, especially since it sounds like you've got 50 OEMs in crypto specific stuff that will go into the other?
And then I guess just briefly, could you give us some indication of where your supply situation and lead times are on your ampere parts within data center? I think you'd said last quarter, they were many months on six months plus, are they still looking like that? And is that sort of a limiting factor at this point in terms of what you can actually ship on the compute side and data center? Colette, you will take one and I'll take the one. Sure. Let me start off Stacy in terms of our guidance for Q1, as you know, we're still in the early innings of our Ampere Architecture. Our Ampere Architecture, as it relates to gaming, as well as what it relates to data center. As we articulated in our call we have been really seeing continued uplift of folks adoption of A100 and it's going quite smoothly than what we had seen in prior overall versions. So when we think about our guidance for Q1, there's many different types of conclusions that will happen at the end of the quarter in terms of what we should put all of our platforms can grow. But the majority of the majority of the growth from Q4 to Q1 will likely be gaming. Thanks, Colette. You asked the question about normal time, our company – at the company level where supply constraint, our demand is greater than our supply. And however for data center, so long as the customers more closely with us, and we do a good job planning between my companies, there should be a supply issue for data center. We just had to do a good job planning and we have direct relationships with each one of the royalty of fees and we have direct relationships with all the young ones. And we could do excellent planning between us.
We shouldn't have a supplier. We shouldn't be supply constrained there. But at the company level, we're supply constrained. Demand is greater than supply. And yes, we have enough supply. Yes, we usually have enough supply to achieve that even the outlook. And we had that situation in Q4. We expect that situation in Q1. And we have enough supply to grow through the year. But supply against constraint and demand is really, really great.
And so we just have to do a really good job planning. And meanwhile, one of the things that, that really came through for us is we have the world's best operations team. Our company is really, really have had an amazing operations team. We build the most complex products in the world, the most complex chips, the most complex packages, the most complex systems. And during Q4, they improved our cycle time and during Q1 we expecting them to improve our cycle time again. And we really are blessed to have such an amazing operations team.
And so during these times it really comes in handy. But overall at the company level where we expected them to be greater than supply, we have enough supply to do better in the outlook. And we have enough supply to grow each quarter throughout the year. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Hi, thanks. I had a question on crypto, I guess Jensen, I know that the CMP stuff and the software drivers stuff that you're doing for the 36. And that's going to help a lot, but I think there is like four or five the big currency was in a move or at least a moving or there on a faster move from a proof of work to proof of stake, which is going to be a lot less compute intensive. So I guess the question that I get a lot is how do you assess the degree to which that drives GPUs back into the secondary market? Is there any way to get treated, get kind of a handle on that? Thanks. Yes. If you look at the recent cash rates first of all, the transitions is going to takes some time. It can't happen overnight. And people have to build trust in all of the new versions. And so they'll take a little bit of time, but I hope it does. I hope that people use our proof of stake over time. And a little bit of these questions don't have to be answered. However I don’t have the optimism either that it will be all proof of stake, I think that proof of work is a very legitimate way of securing the currency.
And in the beginning while any currency is building its reputation, then take something like a group of work to do so. And so I think proof of work is going to be around for a bit. We developed CMP for this very reason, just so that there are different versions. We have different versions of our products for gaming, for professional visualization, for high performance computing, for deep learning. It stands to reasoning that you have to do a different version for CMP and we can solve it directly the way that we go-to-market would be to go directly to the industrial miners to – and it’s a great benefit to them. So they don’t have to chasing around spot markets. It’s a great benefit to the gamers. And because they want a game, and the game demand is just probably is off a chart. And so this is visibility really beneficial to everybody. The recent hash rate growth was really a result of several dynamics. The first dynamic is the install base. Most people thought that the – once the mining – the GPUs come back into the aftermarket, a small part does that, some people do that, but the vast majority don't keep them. And the reason for that is because obviously they believe in Ethereum and so – they're industrial miners that's what they do. And so, they're keeping around for when the profitability returns and they could kick start the mining gear. We saw – that's what we saw in the latter part of last year. We saw the hash rates starting to grow.
Most of that was result of the installed miners reactivating their equipment. It wasn't until earlier this year that we started to see a demand in our own GPUs. And when that starts to happen, there are some different dynamics. There's – the primary source these days come from powerful ASICs. And then there's some that that comes from our GPU and other GPUs in the marketplace. And so, I think that this is going to be a part of our business. It won't grow extremely large, no matter what happens. And the reason for that is because when it starts to grow large more ASICs comes into market, which kind of needs it. And when the market becomes smaller, it's harder for ASICs to sustain the R&D.
And so the spot miners, industrial miners come back. And then we'll create CMPs. And so, we expect that to be kind of a – to be a small part of our business as we go forward. Now, one of the important things is to realize that in the near-term, the – because we're in the beginning parts of our Ampere ramp, only two quarters into a multi-year cycle. This is also the first time that we've completely changed computer graphics. RTX using ray tracing is completely different than virtualization. And so this is a fundamental change in the way we do computer graphics and the results have been spectacular. There are some 200 million install base in desktops and 50 million in laptop. And the vast majority of them, we've only upgraded approximately I think it's something like 50% of the install base has been upgraded to RTX. And so there is a giant install base and the install base is growing that we need to upgrade to the next generation of computer graphics. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yes, guys. Thanks for letting me to ask questions. I want to go back to data center. You've been very kind over the last couple of quarters to call out Mellanox both when it was a positive driver and when it was a headwind. I'm kind of curious as you do – when you look into the fiscal first quarter, is there anything of distinction to mention around Mellanox versus core data center? And I guess as a follow on, the key metric that a lot of investors were looking at is when does the core data center business year-over-year growth starts to reaccelerate? And some of that is just simple math where you're just comping very hard compares from last year. But Jensen how would you think about data center year-over-year growth in the context of a reopening trade or any sort of new applications out there? I mean, what happened – what helped last time around was the move to natural language AI. Is there another big sort of AI application we should be thinking about as we think about data center growth reaccelerating? We're expecting – Mellanox was down this last quarter. And our compute business grew double digit and offset – more than offsets the decline in Mellanox. We expect Q1 to be a growth quarter to Mellanox and we expect this coming year to be quite an exciting year of growth for Mellanox. The business is growing and ethernet is growing for CSPs is growing in InfiniBand for high performance computing and the Switch – the Switches have grown. Switch business grew 50% year-over-year. And so, we're seeing really terrific growth there. One of the new initiatives and we're going to see success towards the second half because the number of adoptions, the number of engagements has grown as our BlueField DPUs. It's used for virtualization for hyperscalers.
It's also used for security. As you know quite well the future of computing and cloud and it's multi-tenant cloud and there's no VPN front door to the cloud. You've got millions of people who are using every aspect of computing. So you need to have distributed firewalls and you can't have it just in one place. The intense focus of security across all of the data centers around the world is really creating a great condition for BlueField, which is really perfect then. And so, I expect our Mellanox networking business to grow very nicely this year. And we expect Q1 to be a great growth quarter for compute as well as Mellanox.
The Killer, great driving application for AI are several – last year you're absolutely right that it with natural language understanding and the transformer model and what is the – what was the core of – and other versions like that really, really made it possible for us to enable all kinds of new applications. So you're going to see a natural language understanding do text completion, and it's going to be integrated – I think it was just announced today that it was going to be integrated into Microsoft Word, and we've been working with them on that for some time.
And so there are some really exciting applications out there, but the new ones that came – that emerged recently are deep learning based conversational AI, where the ASR, the speech recognition as well as the speech synthesis are now based on deep learning, it wasn't before. And they were based on models that ran on CPUs, but now with these deep learning models, the accuracy is much, much higher and it has the ability to also mimic your voice and be a lot more natural. And so, the ability – these models are much more complex and much larger.
The other big huge driver is the recommenders. This is something really worthwhile to take a look at is called deep learning recommender models, and recommenders have historically – whether it's for shopping and or personalizing websites are personalizing your store, recommending your basket, recommending your music. Historically, it's been – and use the traditional machine learning algorithms, but because of the accuracy and – just the extraordinary economic impact that comes from an incremental 1% in accuracy for most of the – mostly the world's large internet businesses people are moving very rapidly to deep learning based models. And these models are gigantic. They're utterly gigantic.
And this is an area that is really driving high-performance computers. And – so we – I expect us to see a lot of momentum there. And the last one is the one that I just spoken out, which has to do with industrial 5G and edge, IoT type of applications for all of the different industries whether it's retail or logistics or transportation, agriculture or warehouses to factories. And so, we're going to see AI and robotics in a very large number of applications in industries and we're just seeing so much excitement there. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back again on the data center business that you just mentioned, Jensen, that the BlueField-2 product poised to kind of ramp and materialize in the back half of the calendar year. How do you see that – is it an attach rate? I think there has been discussions in the past about – all servers could potentially over time incorporate this layer of acceleration. How quickly should we think about that ramp? And then the second question is, can you just at a high level talk about how CPU – how a CPU strategy you're thinking about that in the context of the broader data center market? Sure. If I could just work backwards, I believe that every single data center node will be outfitted with a GPU someday. And that someday is probably call it five years from now. And the fundamental driver of it is going to be security. Every single application in the data center and every single node in the data center has to be individually secured, zero trust computing, zero or confidential computing or zero trust computing. These initiatives are going to cause every data center to have every single application and every single node would be secured, which means every one of those computers have to have a control plane that is isolated from the application plane. And all the applications cannot share the same resources because that application could be malware, that application could be an intruder.
No application could have access to the control plan. And yet today the software defined data centers, the software defined networking, software defined storage, all of the security agents are running in the same processors as the applications and that hasn't changed. You're seeing the cloud – the CSPs in the world moving in this direction. Every single data center will have to move in that direction. So every node will be a DPU process for the software, for the infrastructure. You're essentially going to see the data center infrastructure would be offloaded from the application point and it will be something like a Bluefield. So I think this is our next multi-billion dollar opportunity, CPS. We support every CPU in the world. And we're the only accelerated computing platform that accelerates every CPU.
Ironically, the only CPU that we don't accelerate for AI is ARM, but we want to change them. ARM has such an exciting future because the nature of their business model and the nature of their architecture is perfect for the future of hyperscalers and data centers. You wanted – you want the most energy efficiency and in every single data center, because every data center is power constrained. We are going to be power constrained in every aspect of computing going forward. And so we would love to build around the own processor and invest in building a great ecosystem around it. And so that all the world's peripherals and all the world's applications can work and – work on any one of the CPUs that we know today.
And I want to start – we're going to start with high-performance computing and start with – all the areas that we have a lot of expertise in to build out our platform. And so, you're starting to see one industry leader after another embraced on and I think that's terrific, but now we've got to energize it with all of the ecosystem support. It can't just be on vertical applications, but we want to create a broad general ARM ecosystem. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. A question for Jensen, I think. Jensen, if you look at the past computing eras, typically it's one ecosystem that that captures 80% of the value of that computing era and mainframes as IBM and many computers with stack PCs, Wintel, cell phones, Nokia and then Apple. So, if you don't get the ecosystem right then you're splitting 20% of the market with a handful of players. So in this next era of computing parallel processing or AI, I think you've articulated the most compelling architectural vision of the data center of the future with data center scale computing devices with CPUs, GPUs, DPUs integrating to the same box serving all workloads in machine virtualized environment. Can you help us understand where is the market in embracing that vision and where is NVIDIA in building out that the ecosystem for that data center scale competing vision. And then maybe as part of that to what extent is CUDA of the kernel for that ecosystem? Thank you. Yes, we're – I think we've done a great job on building out the platforms for several ecosystems around the world. And the domain that we do incredibly well out on – the domains that I have to do with accelerated computing, we pioneered this approach. And we brought it to high-performance computing at first and we accelerated scientific computing and we democratized supercomputing for all researchers, anybody who wants to have a supercomputer now can. And computing, it will simply not be the obstacle that somebody's discovery. We did the same for artificial intelligence. We did the same for visualization. We brought – we expanded the nature of gaining tremendously. Our GeForce today is the largest gaming platform. It’s the largest single largest body of computers that are used for gaming.
And in each case, we expanded the market tremendously. We would like to do the same for data center scale computing, as it applies to virtualizing these applications, these applications are also in the process. They've historically required dedicated systems, but they're moving into a virtualized data center environment.
And we are best at doing that. They run on our platform today. We have the ability to virtualize it and put it into the data center and make it remotely available. And so these applications, these domains are some of the most important domains in the world. And so we're in the process of getting them. By doing so and making our architecture available to CSPs and OEMs, we could create this accelerated computing platform available to everybody.
And so that's we're seeing our journey doing them. First, creating an architecting this platform, and then putting it literally into every single data center in the world. But we would also like to the next step of our journey is there's the Phase 3 of AI and has to do about – it has to do with turning every end point into a data center, whether it's a 5G tower, a warehouse or retail store, a self-driving car, a self-driving truck, these are going to be – they're all going to be essentially autonomous data centers and/or they're going to run AI, but they're going to run a lot more. They're going to do security in real time. Its networking is going to be incredible. It's going to run software to 5G and GPO accelerating 5G, we call areal.
And so these platforms are going to become data centers. There'll be secure. The software is protected and we can't tamper with. It if you tamper with it, of course won't run. And so the capability of these clouds will move all the way out to the edge. And we're in the best position to be able to do that. So I did the – in this new world of post close to Moore's law post in arts gaming in this new world where AI and software that writes software in this new world, where data centers are going to be literally everywhere and they're unprotected. There's no giant building with a whole bunch of people that secured. And in this new world where a software is going to enable this autonomous feature, I think we are a perfectly positioned for it. This is all the time we have for Q&A today. I will now turn the call back to CEO, Jensen Huang. Thanks for joining us today. Q4 have the truly breakout year for Nvidia. The two biggest engines of our business gaming and data center posted powerful growth. Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.
So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now.
With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.
The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia’s technology. The urgency to digitize, automate and accelerate innovation has never been higher. We are ready. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks a lot. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","the call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website . the webcast will be available until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 . all our statements are made as of today, February 24, 2021 based on information currently available to us .",0.0

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q1 was exceptionally strong with revenue of $5.66 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 84%. We set a record in total revenue in gaming, data center and professional visualization driven by our best ever product line ups and structural tailwinds across our businesses.
Starting with gaming, revenue of $2.8 billion was up 11% sequentially and up 106% from a year earlier. This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth, beginning with the fall launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the Ampere GPU architecture, the 30 Series has been our most successful launch ever, driving incredible demand and setting records for both desktop and laptop GPU sales.
Channel inventories are still leading, and we expect to remain supply constrained into the second half of the year. With our Ampere GPU architecture now ramping across the stack in both desktop and laptops, we expect the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade.
Laptops continue to drive strong growth this quarter as we started ramping the Ampere GPU architecture across our lineup. Earlier this month, all major PC OEMs launch GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops based on the 3080, 39 -- 3070 and 3060 as part of their spring refresh.
In addition, mainstream versions based on the 3050 and 3050 Ti will be available this summer, just in time for back-to-school starting at price points as low as 799. This is the largest ever wave of GeForce gaming laptops over 140 in total, as OEMs address the rising demand from gamers, creators and students for NVIDIA's powered laptops.
The RTX 30 Series delivers our biggest generational leap in performance ever. It also features our second generation ray tracing technology and frame rate boosting, AI powered DLSS. The RTX is a reset for graphics with over 60 accelerated games. This quarter, we added many more, including Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Crysis Remastered and Outriders. We also announced that DLSS is now available in Unreal Engine 4 and soon in the Unity game engine, enabling game developers to accelerate frame rates with minimal effort.
The RTX 30 Series also offers NVIDIA Reflex, a new technology that reduces system latency. Reflex is emerging as a must have feature for e-sports gamers who play competitive titles like Call of Duty Warzone, Fortnite, Valorant and Apex Legends. We estimate that about 75% of GeForce gamers play e-sports games, and 99% of e-sports pros compete on GeForce.
We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent. We've taken actions to optimize GeForce GPUs for gamers, while separately addressing mining demand with Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, or CMPs. Last week, we announced that newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphic cards will have their Ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half and carry a low hash rate or LHR identifier.
Along with the updated RTX 3060, this should allow our partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices. To help address mining demand, CMP products launched this quarter, optimized for mining performance and efficiency because they don't meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU, they don't impact the supply of GeForce GPUs to gamers. CMP revenue was $155 million in Q1 reported as part of the OEM and other category. And our Q2 outlook assumes CMP sales of $400 million.
Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform passed 10 million registered numbers this quarter. GFN offers nearly 1,000 PC games from over 300 publishers more than any other cloud gaming service, including 80 of the most popular free to game play games. GFN expands the reach of GeForce to billions of under powered Windows PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, Android devices, iPhones and iPads. GFN is offered in over 70 countries with our latest expansions including Australia, Singapore and South America.
Moving to Pro Vis. Q1 revenue was $372 million, up 21% both sequentially and year-on-year. Strong notebook growth is driven by a new sleek and powerful RTX powered mobile workstations with Max-Q technology and the enterprise's continued to support remote workforce initiatives. Desktop workstations rebounded as enterprise resumed the spending that has been deferred during the lockdown with continued growth likely as offices open.
Key verticals driving Q1 demand include manufacturing, health care, automotive and media and entertainment. At GTC, we announced the coming general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, the world's first technology platform that enables global 3D design teams to collaborate in real time in a shared space working across multiple software speeds.
This incredible technology builds on NVIDIA's entire body of work and is supported by a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Early adopters includes sophisticated design teams and some of the world's leading companies such as BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP.
Over 400 companies have been evaluating Omniverse and nearly 17,000 users have downloaded the open beta. Omniverse is offered as a software subscription on a per user and a per server basis. As the world becomes more digital, virtual and collaborative, we see a significant revenue opportunity for Omniverse. We also announced powerful new Ampere architecture GPUs for next generation desktop and laptop workstation. The new RTX powered workstations will be available from all major OEMs.
Moving to Automotive. Q1 revenue was $154 million, up 6% sequentially and down 1% year-on-year. Growth in AI cockpit revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in legacy infotainment revenue. We extended our technology leadership with the announcement of the next generation NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan SoC.
Atlan will deliver an unrivalled 1,000 trillion operations per second of performance and integrate data center class NVIDIA BlueField networking and security technologies to enhance vehicle performance and safety, making it a true data center on wheels. Atlan, which targets automakers 2025 models will follow the NVIDIA DRIVE or an SoC which delivers 254 TOPS that has been selected by leading vehicle makers for production timelines starting next year.
The NVIDIA DRIVE platform has achieved global adoption across the transportation industry. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds 8 billion through fiscal 2027. Most recently, Volvo Cars announced that it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin building on our next great momentum with some of the largest automakers including Mercedes Benz, SAIC and Hyundai Motor Group.
In robotaxi's we added GM Cruise to the growing number of companies adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, which includes Amazon Zoox and DiDi. We’ve also had a great traction with new energy vehicle makers. Our latest wins include Faraday Future, R Auto, IM Motors and VinFast, which join previously announced wins with SAIC, NIO, XPeng and Li Auto.
And in trucking, Navistar is partnered with TuSimple in selecting NVIDIA DRIVE for autonomous driving, joining previously announced robo autonomous solutions and plus. NVIDIA is helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. Our full stack software defined AV and AI cockpit platform spans silicon, systems, software and AI data center infrastructure, enabling over the air upgrades to enhance safety and the joy of driving throughout the vehicles lifetime. Starting with our lead partner Mercedes Benz, NVIDIA DRIVE can transform the automotive industry with amazing technologies delivered through a new software and services business models.
Moving to data center. Revenue topped $2 billion for the first time, growing 8% sequentially and up 79% from the year-ago quarter, which did not include Mellanox. Hyperscale customers led our growth this quarter, as they built infrastructure to commercialize a AI in their services. In addition, cloud providers have adopted the A100 to support growing demand for AI for enterprises, startups and research organizations.
Customers have deployed NVIDIA's A100 and DGX platforms to train deep neural networks with rising computational intensity led by two of the fastest growing areas of AI; natural language understanding and deep recommendators. In March, Google Cloud Platform announced general availability of the A100 with early customers including square for its cash application and Alphabet’s DeepMind. The A100 is deployed across all major hyperscale and cloud service providers globally. And we see strengthening demand in the coming quarters.
Every industry is becoming a technology industry and accelerating investments in AI infrastructure, both through the cloud and on-premise. Our vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year led by consumer internet companies. For example, NAVER, a leading internet technology company in Korea and Japan is training giant AI language models at scale on DGX SuperPOD to pioneer new services across e-commerce, search, entertainment and payment applications.
We continue to gain traction in France with hyperscale and vertical industry customers across a broadening portfolio of GPOs. We had record shipments of GPUs used for inference. Inference growth is driving not just the T4, which was up strongly in the quarter, but also the universal A100 Tensor Core GPU as well as the new Ampere architecture based A10 and A30 GPUs, all excellent at training as well as inferencing.
Customers are increasingly migrated from CPUs to GPUs for AI inference for two chief reasons. First, GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and the complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency. In April's MLPerf AI inference benchmark, NVIDIA achieved the top results across every category that include computer vision, medical imaging, recommender systems, speech recognition and natural language processing. And second, NVIDIA's full stack inference platform including tritons and inference server software simplifies the complexity of deploying AI applications by supporting models from all major frameworks, and optimizing for different query types including batch, real time and streaming.
Triton is supported by several partners in the cloud services, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tencent. Examples of how customers use NVIDIA's inference platform include Microsoft for grammar checking in office, the United States Postal Service for real time package analytics, T-Mobile for customer service, Pinterest for image search, and GE Healthcare for heart disease detection.
We also have strong results with Mellanox networking products. Like our compute business, strong growth was driven by hyperscale customers across both Ethernet and InfiniBand. We achieved key design wins and proof-of-concept trials for the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU, the cloud service providers and consumer internet companies. We also unveiled BlueField-3, the first DPU built for AI and accelerated computing, with support from VMware, Splunk, NetApp, Cloudflare and others.
BlueField-3 is the industry's first 400 gig DPU and delivers the equivalent data center services of up to 300 CPU cores. It transforms traditional server infrastructure into zero trust environments in which every user is authenticated by offloading and isolating data center services for business applications. With BlueField-3, our DPU roadmap will deliver an unrivalled 100x performance increase over a 3-year period.
As we look back at the first full year since closing the Mellanox acquisition, we are extremely pleased with how the business has performed. It has not only exceeded our financial projections, but it has been instrumental in key new platforms like the DGX SuperPOD and the BlueField DPU, enabling our data center scale computing strategy.
In April, we held our largest ever GPU Technology Conference with more than 200,000 registrants from 195 countries. Jensen's keynote has over 14 million views. At GTC, we announced our first data center CPU, NVIDIA Grace, targeted at processing massive next generation AI models with trillions of parameters. The arm based processor will enable 10x the performance and energy efficiency of today's fastest servers.
With Grace, NVIDIA has a three chip strategy with GPU, DPU and now CPU. The Swiss National Supercomputing Center and the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace powered supercomputers. Grace will be available in early 2023.
GTC is first and foremost for developers. We announced NVIDIA developed and optimized pre-trained model availability on the NVIDIA GPU cloud registry. Developers can choose a pre-trained model and adapt it to fit their specific needs using NVIDIA TAO, our transfer learning software. TAO fine tunes the model with customers own small dataset to get models accustomed without the cost, fine and massive data sets required to train a neural net -- a neural network from scratch.
Once a model is optimized and ready for deployment, users can integrate it with an NVIDIA application framework that fits their use. For example, the NVIDIA Jarvis framework for interactive conversational AI is now generally available and used by customers such as T-Mobile and Snap and the NVIDIA Merlin framework for deep recommendators is an open beta with customers such as Snap and Tencent. With the chosen application framework, users can launch NVIDIA Fleet Command software to deploy and manage the AI application across a variety of NVIDIA GPU powered devices.
For enterprise customers, we unveiled a new enterprise grade software offering available as a perpetual license or subscription. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of AI software that speeds development and deployment of AI workloads and simplifies management of enterprise AI infrastructure. Through our partnership with VMware hundreds of thousands of vSphere customers will be able to purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise with the same familiar pricing model that IT managers use to procure VMware infrastructure software.
We also made several announcement at GTC about accelerating the delivery of both NVIDIA AI and accelerated computing to enterprises and edge users among the world's largest industries. Leading server OEMs launched NVIDIA certified systems, which are industry standard servers based on the NVIDIA EGX platform. They run NVIDIA AI enterprise software and are supported by the NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs. Initial customers including Lockheed Martin and Mass General Brigham.
In addition, we announced the NVIDIA AI on 5G platform supported on NVIDIA EGX servers to enable high performance 5G Ram and AI applications. The AI on 5G platform leverages the NVIDIA Aerial software and the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 converged card which combines our GPUs and DPUs. We are teaming with Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Mavenir, Radisys and Wind River in developing solutions based on our AI on 5G platform to speed the creation of smart cities and factories, advanced hospitals and intelligent stores.
Another highlight at GTC was the announcement of a broad range of initiatives to strengthen the Arm ecosystem across cloud data centers, HPC, enterprise and edge and PCs. In the cloud, we are bringing together AWS Graviton2 processors and NVIDIA DPUs to provide a range of benefits including lower costs, support for virtual game streaming experiences and greater performance for Arm based workloads.
In HPC, we are bringing together an Ampere Altra CPU with NVIDIA GPUs, DPUs and NVIDIA HPC software development kit. Initial supercomputing centers deployed include Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Labs. In the Enterprise and Edge, we're bringing together Marvell Arm-based OCTEON processors and the NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate video analytics and cybersecurity solutions. And in PCs, we are bringing together MediaTek's Arm-based processors with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to enable realistic ray trace graphics and cutting edge AI in a new class of Arm-based laptops.
On our Arm acquisition, we are making steady progress in working with the regulators across key regions. We remain on track to close the transaction within our original timeframe of early 2022. Arm's IP is widely used, but the company needs a partner that can help it achieve new heights. NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to enhance Arm's capabilities, and we are committed to invest in developing the Arm ecosystem, enhancing R&D, adding IP and turbo charging its development to grow into new markets in the data center, IoT and embedded devices, areas where it only has a light footprint or in some cases, none at all.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 100 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points from a year earlier and up 70 basis points sequentially. The sequential non-GAAP increase was largely driven by a more favorable mix within data center and the addition of CMP products. Q1 GAAP EPS was $3.03, up 106% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, up 103% from a year-ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect broad base sequential year-on-year revenue growth in all of our market platforms. Our outlook includes $400 million in CMP. Aside from CMP, the sequential revenue increase in our Q2 outlook is driven largely by data center and gaming. In data center, we expect sequential growth in both compute and networking.
In gaming, with the move to low hash rate G4 CPUs, and increasing the amount of CMP products, we are making a significant effort to serve miners with CMPs and provide more GeForce cards to gamers. If there is additional CMP demand, we have supplied flexibility to support it. We believe these actions combined with strong gaming demand will drive an increase in our core gaming business for Q2.
Now to look at our outlook for Q2. Revenue is expected to be $6.3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.6% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.76 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively.
GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight that Jeff Fisher and Manuvir Das will keynote Computex on the evening of May 31 U.S time, as well as several upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending the Evercore TMT Conference on June 7, the BofA 2021 Global Technology Conference on June 9, and the NASDAQ Virtual Investor Conference on June 16. Our earnings call to discuss our second quarter results is scheduled for Wednesday, August 18.
With now, we will open the call for question. Operator, would you please poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. Colette, I was wondering if you can double click a little more on the guidance. I know of the 600 to 650 in growth, you said 250 is coming from CMP and both gaming and data center will be up. Can we assume that they're up about equally, so you're getting about 200 roughly from each of those? And I guess second part of that is within data center, I'm wondering can you speak to the networking piece. It sounds like maybe it was up a bit more modestly than it's about the past few quarters. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. Thanks. Yes. Thanks so much for the question on our guidance. So I first want to start off with we see demand really across all of our markets. All of our different market platforms we do plan to grow sequentially. You are correct, that we are expecting a increase in our CMP. And outside of our CMP growth, we expect the lion share of our growth to come from our data center and gaming. In our data center business, right now our product lineup couldn't be better. We have a strong overall portfolio, both for training and for inferencing. And we're seeing strong demand across our hyperscales and vertical industries. We've made a deliberate effort on the gaming perspective to supply to our gamers the cards that they would like, given the strong demand that we see. So that will also support the sequential growth that we are receiving. So you are correct, that we do see growth sequentially coming from data center and gaming, both contributing quite well to our growth. Thanks a lot, Colette. I didn't answer your second question, my apologies, on Mellanox. Additionally, Mellanox is an important part of our data center. It is quite integrated with our overall products. We did continue to see growth this last quarter and we are also expecting them to sequentially grow as we move into Q2. They are a smaller part of our overall data center business, but again, we do expect them to grow. And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, I think I heard you talk about a vision for acceleration in data center as we go through the year. And as you think about the purchase obligations that you reported up 45% year-on-year, how much of that is related to long lead time data center and how should we interpret that in terms of what kind of ramp we could see in the second half, particularly as you think about perhaps adding more growth from enterprise on top of what was hyperscale driven growth in the April quarter? Thank you. Let me take the first part of your question regarding our purchasing of inventory and what we're seeing in just both our purchase commitments and our inventory. The market has definitely changed to where long lead times are required to build out our data center products. So we're on a steady stream to both commit longer term so that we can make sure that we can serve our customers with the great lineup of products that we have. So yes, a good part of those purchase commitments is really about those long lead times, the components to create the full systems. I will turn the second part of the question over to Jensen. What was the second part of the question, Colette? Second part of the question was, what do we see in the second half as it relates to the lineup of enterprise. And we articulated in our pre remarks regarding that we're seeing an acceleration. Thank you. Yes. We're seeing strength across the board in data centers, and we're seeing strengthening demand. CGR, our data center as you know is accelerated with a range of applications. From scientific computing, both physical and life sciences, data analytics, and classical machine learning, cloud computing and cloud graphics, which is becoming more important because of remote work. And very importantly, AI both for training as well as inferencing for classical machine learning models, like XGBoost all the way to deep learning we base models like conversational AI, natural language, understanding recommender systems, and so on.
And so we have a large suite of applications in our NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC as the case accelerate these applications and data centers. They run on systems that range from HGX for the hyperscalers to DGX for on-prem to EGX for Enterprise and Edge, all the way out to AGX autonomous systems. And this quarter, at GTC, we announced one of our largest initiatives and it's taken us several years. You've seen working on it in open -- on the open over the course of the last several years, and it's called EGX it's our Enterprise AI platform.
We're democratizing AI, we're bringing it out in cloud, we're bringing it to enterprises, and we're bringing it out to the Edge. And the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world at the automation that has to be done has data that has data sovereignty issues, or data rate issues that can't move to the cloud easily. And so we have to move the computing to their premise and oftentimes all the way up to the edge. The platform has to be secure, has to be confidential, it has to be remotely manageable. And of course, it has to be high performance, and it has to be cloud native. And that's the built -- be built like the cloud, the modern way of doing cloud data centers. And so these stacks has to be modern.
On the one hand, it has to be integrated into classical enterprise systems on the other hand, which is the reason why we work so closely with VMware and accelerated VMware's operating system, data center operating system, software defined data center, stacks on BlueField. Meanwhile, we ported NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA HPC on to VMware so that they could run distributed large scale accelerated computing for the very first time. And that partnership, that partnership was announced at VMworld. It was announced at GTC and we're in the process of going to market with all of our enterprise partners, their OEMs, their value added resellers, their service -- their solution integrators all over the world.
And so, this is a really large endeavor and the early indications of it are really exciting. And the reason for that is because as you know, our data center business is more than 50% vertical industry enterprise already. It's more than 50% vertical industry enterprises already and then by creating this easy to adapt and easy to integrate stack, it's going to allow them to move a lot faster. And so this is the next major wave of AI. This is a very exciting part of our initiative. And it's something that I've been working on for -- we've been working on for quite a long time. And so I'm delighted with the launch this quarter at GTC. The rest of the data centers do agree to.
As Colette mentioned, hyperscale demand is strengthening. We're seeing that for computing and networking. You know that the world's cloud data centers are moving to deep learning, because every small percentage that they get out of predictive inference drives billions and billions of dollars of economics for them. And so the movement towards deep learning shifts the data center workload away from CPUs, because accelerators are so important. And so hyperscale, we're seeing great traction and great demand.
And then lastly, supercomputing. Supercomputer centers all over the world are building out. And we're really in a great position there to fuse for the very first time simulation based approaches as well as data driven based approaches what is called artificial intelligence. And so across the board, our data center is gaining momentum. And we see -- we just see great strength right now and it's growing strength. And we're really set up for years of growth in data center. This is the largest segment of computing as you know, and this segment of computing is going to continue to grow for some time to come. And your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results. I'm going to first slip in two of them here. First of all, Colette, I think in the past you talked about how much of your gaming install base is kind of on the pre-race ray tracing platforms are really kind of the context behind the upgrade cycle that's still part of us. That's kind of question one. And then, on the heels of the last question, I was just curious things like VMware's project model ray as we think about the BlueField-2 product and BlueField-3, how should we think about those starting to become or when should they become really material incremental revenue growth contributors for the company? Thank you. So, yes, we have definitely discussed in terms of the great opportunity that we have in front of us of folks moving to our ray traced GPUs. And we're in the early stages of that. We've had a strong cycle already, but still we probably have approximately 15% moving up a little bit from that at this time. So it's a great opportunity for us to continue to upgrade a good part of that install base, not only just with our desktop GPUs, but the RTX laptops are also a great driver of growth and upgrading folks to RTX. Colette, do you want me to take the second one? Yes, please. Aaron, a good -- great question on BlueField. First of all, the modern data center has to be rearchitected for several reasons. There are several fundamental reasons that makes it very, very clear that the architecture has to change. The first insight is cloud-native, which means that a data center is shared for everybody. [Indiscernible] you don't know who's coming and going and it's exposed to everybody on the internet.
Number two, you have to assume that it's a zero trust environment because you don't know who's using it. It used to be that we have perimeter security, but those days are gone because it's cloud-native, it's remote access, it's multi tenant, it's public cloud, the infrastructure is used for internal and external applications. So number two has to be -- it has to be zero trust.
The third reason is something that started a long time ago, which is software defined in every way, because you want -- you don't want a whole bunch of bespoke custom gear inside a data center, you want to avoid the data center with software. You want to be software defined. The software defined data center movement enabled this one pane of glass, a few IT managers orchestrating millions and millions of nodes of computers at one place. And the software runs what used to be storage, networking, security, virtualization and all of that -- all of those things have become a lot larger and a lot more intensive. And it's consuming a lot of the data center.
In fact, the estimate depending on how you want to think about it, how much security you want to put on it, if you assume that it's a zero trust data center, probably half of the CPU cores inside the data center is running not applications. And that's kind of strange, because you created the data center to run services and applications, which is the only thing that makes money. The other half of the computing is completely soaked up running the software defined data center just to provide for those applications. And that you could imagine even accepting, if you like, as the cost of doing business. However, it commingles the infrastructure, the security plane and the application plane and exposes the data center to attackers.
And so you fundamentally want to change the architecture as a result of that. To offload that software defined virtualization and the infrastructure operating system, if you will, and the security services to accelerate it because Moore's law has ended and moving software that was running on one CPU -- one set of CPUs, which is really, really good already to another set of CPUs is going to make it more effective, separating it doesn't make more effective. And so you want to offload that and take the -- take that application software and accelerated using accelerators, a form of accelerated computing. And so that's -- these things are fundamentally what BlueField is all about. And we created the processor that allows us to -- BlueField-2 replaces approximately 30 CPU cores. BlueField-3 replaces approximately 300 CPU cores, which just -- put it give you a sense of it. And BlueField-4, we're in the process of building already. And so, we've got a really aggressive pipeline to do this.
Now, how big of this market, the way to think about that is every single networking chip in the world will be a smart network [indiscernible] -- it will check. It will be a programmable accelerated infrastructure processor. And that's what the DPU is, it's a data center on a chip. And I believe every single server node will have it. It will replace today's mix with something like BlueField, and it will offload about half of the software processing that's consuming data centers today. But most importantly, it will enable this future world where every single packet, every single application is being monitored in real time all the time for intrusion.
And so, how big is that application? How big is that market? Just, 25 million servers a year. That's the size of the market. And we know that servers are growing, and so those give you a feeling for that. And then in the future servers are going to move out to the Edge. And all of those Edge devices will have something like BlueField. And then how are we doing? We're doing PLCs now with just about every internet company. We're doing really exciting work there.
We've included it in high performance computing, so that it's possible for supercomputers in the future to be cloud-native, to be zero trust, to be secured and still be a supercomputer. And then we expect next year to have meaningful, if not significant revenues contribution from BlueField, and this is going to be a really large growth market for us. You can tell, I'm excited about this. And I put a lot of my energy into it. The company is working really hard on it. And this is a form of accelerated computing that's going to really make a difference. And your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, is NVIDIA able to ring fence this crypto impact in your CMP product? So even if, let's say crypto goes away, for whatever reason, the decline is a lot more predictable and manageable than what we saw in the 2018, '19 cycle. And then kind of part B of that is, how do you think about your core PC gamer demand? Because when we see these kind of 106% year-on-year growth rate, it brings questions of sustainability. So give us your perspectives on these two topics, just how does one ring fence kind of the crypto effect? And what do you think about the sustainability of your core PC gamer demand? Thank you. Sure. Thanks a lot. First of all, it's hard to estimate exactly how much and where crypto mining is being done. However, we can only assume that the vast majority of it is contributed by professional miners, especially when the amount of mining increases tremendously like in-house [ph]. And so we created the CMP. And CMP and GeForce are not fungible. You could use GeForce for mining, but you can't use CMP for gaming. CMP is yields better and producing those doesn't take away from the supply of GeForce. And so it protects our GeForce supply for the gamers.
And the question that you have is what happens when on the tail end of this? There's several things that we hope. And we learned a lot from the last time, but you never learn enough about this dynamic. What we hope is that that the CMPs will satisfy the miners at work will stay in mines, in the professional mines. And we're trying to produce a fair amount of them and we have secured a lot of demand for the CMPs and we will fulfill it.
And what makes it different this time is several things. One, we're in the beginning of our RTX cycle, whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And now exactly was at the tail end of the GTX cycle, because the last GTX and it was the tail end of GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we reinvented computer graphics, we reset the computer industry. And after 3 years, the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developers need to do ray tracing, every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing.
And so if you lose ray tracing, these applications are so much better. And they simply run too slow on GTX's and so we're seeing a reset of the install base, if you will. And at a time when the gaming market is the largest ever, we've got this incredible install base of GeForce users. We've reinvented computer graphics and reset the install base and create an upgrade opportunity that's really exciting at a time when the market is the gaming market, the gaming industry is really large.
And what's really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming. And it's infused into sports, e-sports. It's infused into art. It's infused into social. And so gaming is -- it has such a large cultural impact now, it's the largest form of entertainment. And I think that the experience we're going through is going to last a while. And so, one I hope that crypto will -- the CMP will steer our GeForce supply to gamers. We see strong demand and I expect to see strong demand for quite some time because of the dynamics that I described. And hopefully in the combination of those two, we'll see strong growth and through strong growth in our core gaming business through the year. And your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Jensen, I had two hopefully quick questions. First, I hearken back to the monitor you guys put out at couple of analyst days ago, the more you spend, the more you save. And you've always been very successful as you brought down the cost of doing something to really drive penetration growth. And so I'm curious with the NVIDIA Enterprise AI software stack, is there a sense that you can give us is how much that brings down the cost of deployment and AI inside the Enterprise? And do you think whether COVID lockdown related or cost related, there's pent up demand that this unlocks? And then my second question is just around government subsidies. A lot of talks out of Washington about subsidizing the chip industry, a lot of that goes towards building fabs domestically. But when I look at AI, I can't think of anything more important to maintain sort of leadership in relative to national security. How do we think about NVIDIA and kind of the impact that these government subsidies might have on either you or your customers or your business trends? The more you buy, the more you [indiscernible], there's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing, we don't accelerate every application. However, for the applications we do accelerate, the acceleration is so dramatic. And because we sell a component, the entire system, the TCO, the TCO of the entire system, and all the services and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost has been reduced by X factors, sometimes 10x, sometimes 15x, sometimes 5x. And so the -- so when we set our mind on accelerating a certain class of applications and recently we worked on true [ph] quantum so that we could help the quantum industry, quantum computing industry it's already there simulators so that they could discover new algorithms and invent future computers, even though it won't happen until 2030. For the next 20 years, that we're going to have 15 years, we're going to have some really, really great work that we can do, using NVIDIA GPUs to do quantum simulations. We recently did a lot of work in natural language understanding in computational biology so that we could decode biology and understand how biology is to infer to understand it and to predictively improve upon it and design new proteins. Those words are so vital. And that's what accelerated computing all about.
Our Enterprise software, and I really appreciate the question. Our Enterprise software used to be just about the BGP, which is virtualizing GPU inside the VMware environment, or inside the Red Hat environment and makes it possible for multiple users to use one GPU, which is the nature of Enterprise virtualization, but now with NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA Fleet Command, whether you're doing collaboration or virtual simulations for robotics and digital twins, design your factory or you're doing data analytics, learning what the predictive features are that could create an AI model, predictive model that you can deploy out at the Edge using Fleet Command. We now have an intense suite of software that is consistent with today's enterprise service agreements. It's consistent with today's enterprise business models, and allows us to support customers directly, and provide them with the necessary service promises that they expect, because they're delivering -- they're trying to build a mission critical application on top.
And, more importantly, by creating this -- prioritizing our software, we provide the ability for our large network of partners, OEM partners, value added resellers, system integrators, solution providers for this large network of hundreds of thousands of IT sales professionals that we are connected to through our network, we give them a product that they can take to market. And so the distribution channel, the sales channel, VMware, the sales channel of Cloudera, the sales channel of all of our partners [indiscernible] and design, Autodesk, [indiscernible] so on so forth, all of these sales channels and all of these partners are now partners and taking our stacks to market.
And we have a fully integrated system that are open to the OEM, so that they could create systems of run the stack. And it's all certified, all tested, all benchmark and, of course, very importantly, all supported. And so this new way of taking our products to market, whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow, and that part of AI is going to continue to grow that business is direct. We sell components directly to them, we support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For Enterprises, there are thousands industries far and wide. And so I think this -- we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more. And your final question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. [Indiscernible] Colette. So Colette, last quarter you had kind of suggested that Q1 would be the trough for, I guess, for gaming as well as the rest of the company beginning in particular, and it would grow sequentially through the year. I guess given the strength we're seeing in the first half, do you still believe that that is the case? And I kind of heard you guys, I think kind of dance around that point a little bit in response to one of the other questions. But could you clarify that? Is that still your belief that that core gaming business can grow sequentially through the rest of the year? And I guess same question is for data center, especially since sounds like hyperscale is now coming back, like after a few quarters of digestion and then all of the other tailwinds you've talked about. I mean, is there any reason to think that data center itself shouldn't also grow sequentially, like through the rest of the year? Yes, Stacy, thanks for the question. So I first of all start with when we talked about our Q1 results. And when we're looking at Q1, we were really discussing a lot about what we expected between Q4 and Q1. Given what we knew was still high demand for gaming. We believed we would continue to grow between Q4 and Q1, which often we don't. And we absolutely have the strength and overall demand to grow. What that then lead was, again, continued growth from Q1 to Q2 as we are working hard to provide more supply for the strong demand that we say. We have talked about that we have additional supply coming. We expect to continue to grow as we move into the second half of the year as well for gaming.
Now, we only guide one quarter at a time, but our plan is to take the supply, serve the overall gamers, work on building out the channel, as we know the channel is quite lean. And so yes, we do and still expect growth in the second half of the year, particularly when we see the lineup of games, the holiday overall coming, the back-to-school, all very important cycles for us. And there's a great opportunity to upgrade this, RTX install base.
Now, in terms of data center, will work in terms of our guidance here. We have growth from Q1 to Q2 planned in our overall guidance. And we do see as things continue to open up a time to accelerate in the second half of the year for data center. We have, again a great lineup of products here. It couldn't be a better lineup now that we've also added the inferencing products and the host of overall applications that are using our software that we have. So this could be an opportunity as well to see that continued growth. We will work in terms of serving the supply that we need for both of these markets. But yes, we can see definitely growth in the second half of the year. There are no further questions at this time. The CEO, Jensen Huang, I'll turn the call back over to you. Well, thank you. Thank you for joining us today. NVIDIA computing platform is accelerating. Launched at GTC, we are now ramping new platforms and initiatives. There are several that I mentioned. First, enabled by the fusion of NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA [indiscernible]. We built Omniverse, a platform for virtual collaboration and virtual worlds to enable tens of millions of artists and designers to create together in their own metaverse. Second, we lay the foundation to be a three check data center scale computing company with GPUs, DPUs and CPUs.
Third, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We partner with cloud and consumer internet companies to scale out and commercialize AI powered services. And we're democratizing AI for every enterprise and every industry. With NVIDIA AGX certified systems, the NVIDIA Enterprise AI Suite pre-train models for conversational AI, language understanding, recommender systems and our broad partnerships across the IT industry, we are removing the barriers for every enterprise to access state-of-the-art AI.
Four, the work of NVIDIA Clara in using AI to revolutionize genomics and biology is deeply impactful for the health care industry, and I look forward to telling you a lot more about this in the future. And fifth, the electric self driving and software defined car is coming. With NVIDIA DRIVE, we are partnering with the global transportation industry to reinvent the car architecture, reinvent mobility, reinvent driving and reinvent the business model of the industry. Transportation is going to be one of the world's largest technology industries.
From gaming, metaverses cloud computing, AI, robotics, self driving cars, genomics, computational biology, NVIDIA is doing important work and innovating in the fastest growing markets today. As you can see, on top of our computing platforms that span PC, HPC, Cloud, Enterprise to Autonomous Edge, we've also transformed our business model beyond chips. NVIDIA vGPU, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Fleet Command and NVIDIA Omniverse adds enterprise software license and subscription to our business model. And NVIDIA GeForce Now and NVIDIA DRIVE with Mercedes Benz as the lead partner, our end-to-end services on top of that.
I want to thank all of the NVIDIA employees and partners for the amazing work you're doing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.

Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another strong quarter with revenue of $6.5 billion and year-on-year growth of 68%. We set records for total revenue, as well as for gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Starting with gaming, revenue was 3.1 billion, was up 11% sequentially, and up 85% from a year earlier. Demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply. We are now four quarters into Ampere architecture, product cycle for gaming and it continues to be our best effort. At COMPUTEX in June, we announced two powerful new GPUs for gamers and creators, the GeForce e RTX 30-80 TI, and our TX 30-70 TI, delivering 50% faster performance than their prior-generation with acclaimed features such as real-time retracing, NVIDIA DLSS, AI, rendering, Reflex, and broadcast.
[Indiscernible] demand was also very strong. OEMs adopted Ampere architecture GPU s in a record number of designs from the top-of-the-line gaming laptops to those -- to mainstream price points as low as $799, that bring the power of GeForce GPUs to gamers, students, and creators on the gum. Ampere architecture-powered laptops feature our third generation Max-Q power optimization technology that enables ultrathin designs, such as the new Alienware X15, the world's most powerful sub-16-millimeter gaming laptop. NVIDIA RTX technology has reset computer graphics and spurred our biggest ever refresh cycle.
Ampere spanned our fastest ramping gaming GPU architecture on Steam. And the combination of [Indiscernible] and Ampere, [Indiscernible] GPUs have only upgraded about 20% of our installed base. 80% have yet to upgrade to our TX. And the audience for global eSports will soon approach 0.5 billion people. While the number of those who live stream games is expected to reach over 700 million. The number of PC gamers on Steam is up almost 20% over the past year. More than 60 RTX games now support NVIDIA's RTX ray tracing or DLSS, including today's biggest game franchises. such as Minecraft, Fortnite, and Cyberpunk. New RTX games this quarter includes Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the top-rated games of all time.
Popular titles like Rainbow Six Siege and rushed, and Minecraft [Indiscernible] in China with over 400 million players. To competitive gamers, NVIDIA Reflex, which includes latency, is now supported by 20 games. Let me say a few words on cryptocurrency mining. In an effort to address the needs of miners and direct G-force to gamers, we increased the supply of Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, or CMP, and introduced low hash rate GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability. Over 80% of our Ampere architecture base G4 shipments in the quarter were low hash rate GPUs.
The combination of Crypto to gaming revenue is difficult to quantify. CMP revenue, which is recognized in OEM was 266 million, lower than our original 400 million estimates on reduced mining profitability. And we expect a minimal contribution from CMP going forward. GeForce NOW reached a new milestone this quarter, surpassing 1,000 PC games, more than any other cloud gaming circle. The premium tier is available for a subscription of $10 per month, giving gamers across access to RTX, cloud performance. even on an underpowered PC, Mac, Chromebook, iOS, or Android device. Moving to pro visualization.
Q2 revenue was a record 519 million, up 40% sequentially, and up 156% year-on-year. Strong sequential revenue growth was led by desktop workstations driven by demand to outfit, design offices at home as remote work becomes the norm across industries, this is also the first big quarter of the Ampere architecture ramp for pro visualization. King verticals driving Q2 demand include automotive, public sector, and healthcare. At SIGGRAPH last week, we announced an expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse, our simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the Metaverse through renewing integrations. Blender, the world's leading open-source 3D animation tool, and Adobe.
We're opening the Omniverse platform to millions of additional users. We are also collaborating with Apple and Pixar to bring advanced [Indiscernible] capabilities to Pixar's, Universal scene description for a month, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices. Omniverse enterprise software is in the early access stage and will be generally available later this year on a subscription basis from NVIDIA's partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many others. Over 500 Companies are evaluating Omniverse Enterprise including BMW, Volvo, and Lockheed Martin.
And more than 50,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since it entered open beta in December. Moving to automotive. Our Q2 revenue was 152 million down 1% sequentially, and up 3% year-on-year Sequential revenue declines in infotainment were largely offset by growth in self-driving. Looking further out, we have substantial design winds set to ramp that we expect will drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years. This quarter, we announced several additional wins. Self-driving startup AutoX unveiled its latest autonomous driving platform to [Indiscernible] powered by NVIDIA DRIVE, the performance and safety capabilities of the software-defined NVIDIA [Indiscernible] platform has enabled AutoX to become one of the first companies in the world to provide full [Indiscernible] driving mobility services without the need for a safe drive on.
In economists trucking, drive ecosystem partner Plus signed a deal with Amazon to provide at least 1 thousand self-driving systems to Amazon's fleet of delivery vehicles. These systems are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE for high-performance, energy-efficient, and centralized AI compute. An autonomous trucking startup embarked is building on NVIDIA DRIVE. The system is being developed for trucks for four major OEMs, Freightliner, Navistar International [Indiscernible], and Volvo, representing the vast majority of class 8 or largest size trucks in the U.S. The NVIDIA drive platform is being rapidly adopted across the transportation industry from passenger-owned vehicles to robotaxi, to trucking and delivery vehicles. We believe everything that moves will be autonomous someday.
Moving to the data center. Revenue of 2.4 billion grew 16% sequentially, and 35% from the year-ago quarter. A year ago, quarter, which was our first quarter to include Mellanox. Growth was driven by both hyper-scale customers and vertical industries, each of which has record revenues. Our flagship a 100s, continuing to ramp across hyper-scale and Cloud computing customers. With Microsoft Azure announcing general availability in June, following AWS and Google Cloud Platforms ' general availability in prior quarters. Vertical industry demand was strong with sequential growth led by financial services, supercomputing, and telecom customers.
We also had exceptional growth in [Indiscernible], which reached a record more than doubling year-on-year revenue from inference focus processors, includes the new A30 GPU, which provides four times the infringe performance of the T4. Customers are also turning to NVIDIA GPUs to take AI to production, and shifting from CPUs to GPUs driven by the stringent performance, latency, and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workloads, and Video Networking products posted solid results. We see momentum across regions driven by our technology of leadership with upgrades to high-speed products such as ConnectX-6, as well as new customer wins across cloud service providers, enterprise, and high-performance computing.
We extended our leadership in supercomputing. The latest top 500 niche shows that NVIDIA technologies power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers, including 70% of all new systems and eight of the top 10, to help companies harness the new industrial high-performance computing revolution. We [Indiscernible] a turnkey AI data center solution with the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD. The same technology that powers our new Cambridge-1 supercomputer in the UK and a number of others in the top 500. We expanded our AI software and subscription offerings, making it easier for enterprises to adopt AIs from the initial development stage through to deployment, and operations.
We announced in video-based command, our Software-as-a-Service offering for operating and managing large-scale, multi-user, and multi-team AI development workloads on DGX SuperPOD. Base Command is the operating and management system software for distributed training customers. We also announced the general availability of NVIDIA Fleet Command, our managed edge AI software-as-a-service offering. Fleet Command helps Companies solve the problem of securely deploying and managing. AI applications across thousands of remote locations, combining the efficiency and simplicity of central management with the cost performance and data sovereignty benefits of real-time processing at the edge.
Early adopters of Fleet Command include some of the world's leading retail, manufacturing and logistics companies and the specialty software companies that work with them. The new NVIDIA Base command and Fleet Command software and subscription offerings followed last quarter's announcements of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is early access with general availability expected soon. Our enterprise software strategy is supported by the NVIDIA certified system program with the server OEMs, which are bringing to market over 55 systems ready to run on video. AI software is out of the box to help enterprises, simplify and accelerate their AI deployment.
The NVIDIA ecosystem keeps getting stronger. NVIDIA Inception, our acceleration platform for AI startups just surpassed 8,500 members with cumulative funding of over 60 billion and numbers in 90 countries. Inception is one of the largest, AI startup ecosystems in the world. [Indiscernible] now has been downloaded 27 million times since it launched 15-years ago, with 7 million in the last year alone. TensorRT for inference has been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times across more than 27,000 Companies, and the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem now exceeds 2.6 million up 4 times in the past 4 years. Let me give you a quick update on Arm.
In nearly one year since we initially agreed to combine this Arm, we have gotten to know the Company, its business, and its people much better. We believe more than ever in the power of our combination, and the benefits it will deliver for ARM. with the UK and for its customers across the world in the era of ai, arms have great potential. We love their business model and are committed to keeping its open licensing approach. And with NVIDIA's scale and capabilities, Arm will make more IP, and sooner, for their mobile and embedded customers while expanding into Data Center, IOT, and other new markets. NVIDIA accelerates computing, which starts with the CPU. Whatever new markets are open with the CPU and our accelerated computing opportunities.
We've announced accelerated platforms for Amazon Graviton, Ampere Computing, MediaTek, and more about expanding cloud computing, AI, cloud gaming, Supercomputing, Edge AI, to Chrome PCs. We plan to invest in the U.K. and we have with the Cambridge-1 supercomputer. And through Arm making U.K. a global center in science, technology, and AI. We are working through the regulatory process, although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns and objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought. We are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to the arm is licenses and the industry.
Moving to the rest of the P and L GAAP gross margin of 64.8% for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from the year earlier, reflecting the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition that may [Indiscernible] cost. GAAP gross margins were up 70 basis points sequentially, non-GAAP gross margins were 66.7% up 70 basis points from a year earlier and up 50 basis points, sequentially, reflecting higher ASPs within the desktop, G4s, GPUs, are continued growth in high end and pure architecture products, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center. Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.94 up 276% from a year earlier.
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, up 89% from the year-earlier, adjusting for the 4-to-1 stock split effective this quarter. Q2 cash flow from operations was a record 2.7 billion. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of Fiscal 2022. We expect another strong quarter with essential, with sequential growth driven largely by accelerating demand in data centers. In addition, we expect sequential growth in each of our three other market platforms. Gaming demand is continuing to exceed supply as we expect channel inventories to remain below target levels as we exit Q3. The contribution of CMP to our revenue outlook is amongst.
Revenue is expected to be 6.8 billion plus or minus 2%, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 1.96 billion, and 1.37 billion respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately 60 million, excluding gains and losses on equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are supposed to be expected 11% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 200 million to 225 million.
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our website. In closing that we highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the following virtual events for the. BMO Technology Summit on August 24, the New Street Big Ideas in Semiconductors Conference on September 9th, the Citi Global Tech Conference on September 13, the Piper Sandler Global Technology Conference on September 14th, and the Evercore ISI Auto check and AI for September 21013, our earnings call to discuss the third-quarter results are scheduled for Wednesday, November 17th. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your question. Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a near and longer-term question on the data center. I think near-term you mentioned the possibility of accelerating data center growth from the 35% grade, I was hoping if you could give us some more color around that confidence and visibility. And then longer-term, Jensen, we've seen a lot of announcements from NVIDIA about your enterprise software opportunity.
I honestly don't know how to model that. It sounds very promising, but how should we model it? What problem are you trying to solve? Is its cannibalizing demand you might have otherwise seen from your public Cloud customers, or is this incremental to grow? So just any guidance or any just insights into how to think about NVIDIA's enterprise software opportunity, longer-term? Thank you. Yes, thanks for the question. We are excluding accelerate as we've already [Indiscernible] but we have [Indiscernible] reduce in the hyper-scale cloud and industrial enterprise this last quarter. And we're seeing accelerated growth.
The exploration in hyper-scale and cloud comes from the transitioning of the cloud services providers in taking their applications, which are now heavily deep learning-driven into production. There were some things that we've spoken about in the past, but we'll make Vinny the ideal partner to scale up with.
And if my lungs, let me apologize. There are several platforms -- there are several elements of our platform. Number 1, Ampere GPU, which is now a universal GPU for AI for training, [Indiscernible] incredibly good for instance, it's terrific and its throughput, it's terrific, and it's a fast response client as well. And therefore, the cost of deployment, the cost of operating the AI applications is the lowest.
The second is the introduction of Tensor RT, which is our optimizing compiler that makes it possible for us to compile and optimize any AI application to our GPS. And whether it's computer vision or natural language industry-leading, conversational. recommender systems, the type of applications that are deploying AIs is really quite vast.
And then lastly, this software inference server that we offer Triton, which supports every one of our GPUs. It supports CPUs as well as GPU s still. So, every internet service provider could operate their entire data center using Triton. These several things are really accelerating our growth. So, the first element is the deployment and transition of deep learning AI applications into large-scale deployment.
In the Enterprise. The application that you're driving AI, as you know, every Enterprise wants to get it a race towards being a tech company and take advantage of connected clouds and connected devices and others. Additional intelligence to achieve, but they have an opportunity to deploy AI services out of the edge. And in order to do, in order to do so, there are several things that have to happen.
First, we have to create a computing platform that allows them to do training in the IT environment that they understand, which is virtualized, which is largely managed by VMware. And our collaboration with VMware, creating a new type of system that could be integrated into Enterprise.
Has been quite a significant effort, and it's in volume production today. The second is a server that allows the enterprise customers to deploy their AI models out to the Edge. And the AI engine, the software suite we've been developing over the last ten years, now has been integrated into this environment and allows the enterprises to basically run out the vast. There are three elements of our stuff would product day. For instance, NVIDIA AI Enterprise.
And an adequate, that basically puts all of the state-of-the-art in [Indiscernible] servers and engines and libraries, that we've industrialized and perfected over the years, making it available to Enterprise license. Second is an operating system platform called Base Command that allows for distribution [Indiscernible] software enrollment in for training and developing models, and then the third is Fleet Command, which is an operating system software product that lets you operate and deploy and manage the AI models out to the Edge.
These three software products, in combination with the server called NVIDIA Certified, taken out through our network of partners is our strategy to tolerate the adoption of AI by the enterprise customers. So, we're really enthusiastic about entering into the software business model.
This is an opportunity there to represent, of course, tens of millions of servers. We believe all of them will be GPU accelerated. We believe that Enterprises will be -- will be deploying and taking advantage of AI to revolutionize the industry and using a credit traditional enterprise software licensing business model. This could represent billions of dollars of [Indiscernible] Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein. Your line is now open, you may ask your question. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back, Colette, the sequential guidance, you gave a little bit of color by segments. I've been looking at your gaming revenues. It's like 3 quarters in a row, you've been up, call it ballpark, 10% or 11%, and my understanding is that was a function of your ability to bring on supply. So, I guess what if the supply doesn't look like as you're going from Q2 into Q3.
And do you think you can still maintain that kind of sequential growth or does it dial down because I also need to -- I also will play that against your other commentary, suggesting that the sequential growth -- and I assume on a dollar basis was driven primarily by datacenters. So how do I think about the interplay within those comments of sequential growth of gaming, especially given the trajectory is out of the last several quarters? So, let me start and all, but [Indiscernible] Stacy, to your question, I guess we're providing the guidance for Q3 of 6.8 billion in revenue. Now excluding CMP, we expect our revenue to grow over 500 million sequentially, a lying share that sequential revenue increase for becoming from Data Center. We do expect gaming to be up slightly on a sequential basis.
But remember we are store supply constrained. Automotive and [Indiscernible] are also expected to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. And from a CMP perspective, we'll probably just have minimal amounts in Q3. So, our Q3 results don't have a seasonality with [Indiscernible] for gaming, and are really about the supply that we believe we can have for Q3. We'll see if Jensen wants to add any more color. Yes, thank you for your questions. As you know RTX is a fundamental recap of computer graphics. This is a technology called ray tracing, which has been the holy grail of computer graphics for quite a long time. In 35 years and in research -- in our NVIDIA research 10 years. When we finally made it possible to do real-time ray tracing with RTX.
RTX's demand is quite incredible, and as you know, [Indiscernible] architecture called GTX is based on programmable shelters than the adventuresome years ago. And now we reset the entire installed house and Ampere is off to just the incredible starting the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our company. And yet, we've only upgraded some 20% -- less than 20% of our total installed base.
So, there's another 80% of the world's PC gaming market that we have yet to upgrade to RTX. RTX. Meanwhile, the number of PC gamers in the world grew substantially. Steam grew 20% just last year. And so, I think the -- a worldwide beginning of our RTX transition. Meanwhile, computer graphics is expanded into so many different new markets. RTX, we've known -- we've always believed what we invent the way that people did the design.
And we're seeing that happening right now as we speak, as workstations are growing faster than ever and have achieved record revenues. And at the same time, because of all of our work with cloud gaming, we now see public clouds putting cloud graphics, whether it's workstations or PC or probably gaming consoles up in the Cloud. So, we're seeing strong demand in PCs, and laptops, and workstations, and mobile workstations, and cloud. [Indiscernible] Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is now open. Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Before my questions, [Indiscernible], I just wanted to say congrats on the [Indiscernible] that's a big honor. For my question. I wanted to follow-on on Stacy's question about supply and Colette, maybe you could give us a little bit of commentary around supply constraints and gaming in the different years or price tiers of your gaming cards.
I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are managing supply across the different price tiers. And I guess it translates into a question of, are the gaming ASPs that we're seeing in the October quarter guidance, are those that you would call sustainable going forward, or do you feel like that mix may change as supply comes online? Thank you. So, I'll start here. Thanks for the question on our overall mix as we go forward. First, our supply constraint in our gaming business is largely attributed to our desktop and notebook. That can mean a lot of different things from our components that are necessary to build so many of our products. But our mix is really important.
Our mix as we are also seeing many of our gamers very interested in our higher-end, higher performance products. We will continue to see that as a driver about overall lifts both our revenue and Canada. I Start overall gross margins. There are quite a few different pieces into our supply that we have to think about, but we're going to try and make the best solutions for our gamers at this time. The Next question we had was the line from C.J. Muse. Your line is from Evercore, your line is now open. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I guess a follow-up question on the supply constraints. When do you think that bill is easy? And how should we think about gaming into the January quarter vis-a-vis typical seasonality, given -- I would assume you would continue to be a supply constraint. Thank you. Colette, I could take it or you can. Either one of us. Go ahead, Jensen, and I'll follow it up if there are some other things, Okay. We're [Indiscernible] of Trinity graphics. And we're supplying constraining graphics while we're delivering record revenues and gross. Assets. Come gaming is growing. Cloud graphics has grown, growing.
RTX made it possible for us to address the design in the creative workstations. Historically the rendering, ray tracing, and photorealistic imagers have largely been done on CPUs. And for the very first time, and you could actually accelerate with a hundred GPUs and its RTX GPUs, and sort of workstation market is really doing great.
The backdrop of that of course is that people are building offices in their homes. [Indiscernible] meanwhile, of course, RTX has reached that -- all of our consumer graphics with the 200 million installed base of PC gamers, and it's time to upgrade. [Indiscernible] We have enough supply to meet our second-half company growth plans and next year, we expect to be able to achieve our Company's growth plans for next year.
Meanwhile, we're happening, and so I think the -- I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment.
But a lot of that has to do with the part of our demand is just too great. RTX is really a once-in-a-generation reset of computer model considered graphics. Nothing like this has happened as, and since the invention is really pipe groundbreaking, and you could see its impact. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results look on execution. The Mellanox networking franchise is a really strong and synergistic addition to the video compute portfolio. I think, kind of near to midterm the team is benefiting from the transition to 200 and 400-gig networking connectivity and cloud and Hyperscale. And then I think in addition to that, you guys are getting some good traction with the Bluefield smart tech products.
Can you just give us a sense of how the business is trending year-over-year, and do you expect continued quarter-over-quarter networking momentum into the second half of this year, especially as the cloud and hyper scalers are going through a server and Capex spending cycle? Yes, I really appreciate that question. Right now. I'm not heavy solid growth quarter and the non-op networking business has really grown incredibly. There are 33 dynamics happening all at the same time. The first is the transition that you're talking about. Do you know that the world data center [Indiscernible] users for computing costs just aggregated, which basically means with a single application is running on multiple servers at the same time?
This is what makes it possible for them to scale out, the more users for an AI application or service, you just have to add more servers. And so, the ease of scale-out that is aggregated computing provides also puts enormous pressure on networking.
They are at a Mellanox that's the world's lowest latency and a high bandwidth and performance networking on the planet. And so, so the ability to scale out and the ability to the provision is desegregated in applications, is really much, much better [Indiscernible] Mellanox networking. So that's number one. Number two, almost every company in the world has to be a high-performance computing company [Indiscernible]
You see that the cloud service providers, one after another, are building effective Supercomputers. What historically with [Indiscernible] and Supercomputing Centers, the cloud-service providers have to build supercomputers themselves. And the reason for that is because of Artificial intelligence and tunes gigantic models. The rate of growth of network sizes. AI models buy this, is doubled every 2 months, is doubling not every year or 2 years is doubling every 2 months.
And so, you can imagine the size when I'm talking about trending AI models that are 100 trillion parameters large. The human brain has a 150 plus synopsis, and so for nuance. And so that gives you a sense of the scale of AI models that people are developing. And so, you're going to see supercomputers that are built out of Mellanox, InfiniBand, and their high-speed networking, along with NVIDIA GPU computing in more and more cloud service providers.
You're also seeing it in enterprises or used in the discovery of [Indiscernible] There is our digital mileage and revolution going on. The computation statements. The large-scale computing that where you wanted now and AI, a better understand biology and better understand chemistry. And bringing both of those deals into the field of Information Sciences. And so, you're seeing large, deeper continuous growth. Enterprises around the world as well.
And so, the second dynamic has to do with our incredibly great networking InfiniBand networking, which was the de facto standard in high-performance computing. And the third dynamic is the data centers going [Indiscernible]. In order to orchestrate and run a Data Center, with just a few people essentially running our entire Data Center. Hundreds of thousands of servers have it is just one computer in front of you.
That entire Data Center software to find and the amount of software that goes into that software-defined datacenter, running on today's GPUs is the network stack, store stack, and now, because the zero trust, the security stack. All of that is putting enormous pressure on the available computing capacity or applications, which is ultimately what data centers are designed to do. And so, for the software-defined data center needs to have a place to tip and infrastructure software and accelerated, to offloaded to accelerated.
And very importantly to isolated from the application points, so that intruders can't jump into the operating system with your all Data Center it did [Indiscernible] data center. And so, the answer to that is [Indiscernible] the ability to offload, accelerate and isolate this datacenter software infrastructure, and to fully up to all of the CPUs I through to run what they're supposed to run was with the application. Not just about every data center in the world is moving towards a 012 model.
And Bluefield is just incredibly well-positioned for these three dynamics, this aggregated computing, which needs really strong adept networking, every company needing high-performance computing, and then lastly, software decline datacenters going zero trusts. And so, these are really important dynamics and I appreciate the opportunity to tell you all that. And you can just tell how super excited about the prospects in the networking business and in importance that they have in these modern data centers. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking my question. I think you hit on a lot of my questions around the Data Center in that last. So maybe I will just ask a kind of on a P&L basis, one of the things that I see in the results, or more importantly, the guide is You're now collect guiding over 67% gross margin, potentially. I'm curious as we move forward, how do you think about the incremental operating gross margin upside still from here, and how you're thinking about the operating merchant leverage for the company from here through the P and L. Thank you. Let me take that in the end if you could just follow up with details of the growth, I think at the highest level -- I really appreciate the question. At the highest level, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence is the single, greatest technology force that the computer industry has ever seen, and potentially the worlds ever seen.
The automation opportunities -- automation opportunity, which drives productivity, which translates directly the cost savings to companies, is enormous. And it opens up -- it opens up opportunities for technology and computing Companies like it's never happened before.
And let me just give you some examples. The fact that we could apply so much technology to warehouse logistics, retail automation, customer call center automation, is really quite unprecedented. The fact that we could automate truck driving and last-mile delivery, providing an automated chauffeur. Those kinds of services and benefits, and products were never imaginable before.
And so, the size of the IT industry if you will the industry that computer Companies like ourselves are part of, has expanded from them before. And so -- the thing that we want to do is to invest as smartly, but as quickly as we can to go after the large operating -- large business opportunities, where we can make a real impact.
And in doing so, while doing so, to do so in a way that is architecturally sensible, one of the things that are really an advantage of our company. It is the nature of the way that we build products, the nature of the way that we build software., our discipline around the architecture, which allows us to be so efficient while doing -- while addressing climate science, on the one hand, digital biology on the other, artificial intelligence and robotics and self-driving cars.
And of course, we always talked about computer graphics and video using one architecture and have. And having the discipline now for almost 30 years has given us incredible operating leverage. That's where the vast majority of our operating leverage comes from, which is architectural. The technologies are architectural, our products are architectural in that way, and the Company is even built architecturally in that way.
And so hopefully, as we go after these large, large market opportunities that AI has provided us, and we do so in a smart and disciplined way, with great leverage through our architecture, we can continue to drive really great operating leverage for the company and for our shareholders. Thank you. We have the next question, which comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I apologize for the short-term nature of the question, but it's what I get asked most frequently. I kind of want to return to the impact of Crypto or the potential impact of Crypto. Colette [Indiscernible] is there any way to kind of gate the effectiveness of the low hash rate G4's.
Why only 80% and not 100%, and how confident are you that the CMP business being down as a reflection of Crypto cooling-off versus perhaps LHR not being that effective. And I bring it up because there's a lot of blogs out there that would suggest that there -- as much as you guys are trying to limit the ability of miners to use GeForce, there are some workarounds. Yes. Go ahead. Let me start there and answer a couple of questions about our strategy that we've put in place in this last couple of quarters. As you recall, what we put in place for us for low hash great cards, as well as putting industry and P cards. So low hash rate cards were to provide for more supply for our GeForce gamers that are out there. We articulated one of the metrics that we were looking at is what percentage of those cards in Ampere, we were able to sell with low hash house cards. Almost all of our cards in Ampere are low hash rates, but also, we're selling other types of cards as well. But at this time, as we move forward, we're much higher than 80%, but just at the end of this last quarter, we were approximately 80. So yes, that is moving up, so the strategy is in place and we'll continue as we move into Q3. I'll move it to Jensen here to see if he can discuss further. There's the question about the strategy of how we're scaling G4 supply [Indiscernible]. We have moved incredibly fast this time with CMPs, and with our [Indiscernible] settings for G4s. And our entire strategy is about steering G4s supply to the initial. And we have every reason to believe that because of the drive and see, which is really a measure of gamers, the rate of growth.
Theme adoption of amtrak GPUs. There's some evidence. That's somewhere successful. But there are somewhere reasons why it's different this time. The first reason, of course, is the LA, NRS, which is new, and the speed at which we responded with CMPs in despair you for supply to damage the second is what at the very beginning of the Ampere and RTX rivals.
As I mentioned earlier, RTX was a complete reinvention of computer graphics when every evidence is that gamers are incredible. And game developers are incredibly excited [Indiscernible]. This form of computer renderings. Graphics rendering is just dramatically more beautiful. And we're at the beginning of that cycle and only 20% has been upgraded so far. So, we have 80% to go in a market that is already quite large and installed base that's quite low, but also growing; last year gamers grew 20% and just [Indiscernible] by three.
The third reserves that our demand is strong and our channel weak, and you can see what we're doing with the shortage of supply as quickly as we're shipping it. It's virtually all of the worlds. And then lastly, and we just have more growth drivers today because of RTX whenever we have the biggest wave of NVM and video laptops, just laptops are our fastest-growing segments of computing and we have the largest waving of the long top coming. The demand for RTX and workstations.
Whereas previously the workstation market was a slow-growing market is now a fast-growing market, almost achieved lightly. And after more than a decade of working on cloud graphics, our cloud graphics is in great demand. And so, all of these segments are seeing high demand while we continue to supply them [Indiscernible] And so I think the situations are very different and RTX is making a huge difference. Thank you. We have the next question, comes from the line of Chris Casper (ph.) of Freeman [Indiscernible] Your question is now open. Thank you. Good evening. My question is about the split between the Hyperscale in the vertical customers in the data center business and the trends you see in each. In your prepared remarks, you said both would be up in the October quarter, but I'm interested to see if you're seeing any different trends there, particularly in the vertical business, as perhaps business conditions normalize and Companies return to the office and they adjust their spending plans accordingly. Yes. Let me start to outlook the question, and I'll [Indiscernible] to Jensen ask you the [Indiscernible]. So far with our Data Center business, with our Q2 results, our vertical industry is still quite a strong percentage, Essentially, 50% of our data center business is going to our vertical industries. Our hyper scales make up the other portion of that, slightly below the 50%, and then we also have our supercomputing business with a very small percentage of it doing quiet, quite well.
As we move into Q3, as we discussed, we will see an acceleration of both our vertical industries and our Hyperscale’s as we move into Q3. With that backdrop, we'll see if Jensen has additional commentary. There is a fundamental difference in Hyperscale use of HPC or AI versus the industrial use of HPC. In the world of hyper scalers and Internet service providers, they're making recommendations on movies and songs. articles, and search results, and so on, so forth.
And the Germans, the improvement in Hyperscale that deep learning and artificial intelligence large recommender symptoms can provide is really [Indiscernible] for them. In the world of industry, the regal wide artificial intelligence is transformative. Recognizing that most of the things that I just mentioned earlier, it's not moving on dynamics in the world's [Indiscernible] industries, whether it helps healthcare, or logistics, or transportation, or retail.
The vast majority of the reasons why, and some of the physical sciences industries, whether it's energy or, or transportation, and also for healthcare. The simulation of [Indiscernible] the simulation of the world was not achievable using traditional first principal simulation approaches. But artificial intelligence or data-driven approaches have completely shaken that up and put us on the head.
Some examples whether are teasing out of control intelligence. so, then you could eat up the simulation or the prediction of the approaching structure or the 3D structure approach, which was recently achieved by a couple of very important networks, it's groundbreaking. And by understanding the [Indiscernible] structure, 3D structures, with understanding it's -- we can better understand these functions and how it would adapt to other proteins and other [Indiscernible]
And it's a fundamental step of the process in drug discovery, and that has just taken a giant leap forward. In the areas of [Indiscernible], it is now possible to consider using data-driven approaches to create models that overcome this -- not overcome but accelerate and make it possible for us to stimulate much larger simulations of Multi-Physics Geometry aware simulations, which is basically climate science.
These are a really important field of work that wouldn't have been possible for another decade at least. And just as we've made possible, using artificial intelligence, the realization of real-time ray tracing in every field of science, whether its climate simulations, energy was describing slug discovery. We're starting to see the industry recognizing that the fusion of the first principal simulation and data-driven artificial intelligence approaches.
It's going to get a giant leap up, and that is a second time on it. The other dynamic for the industry is for the very first time they can deploy AI model out to the edge to do a better job with agriculture, to do a better job with asset protection and warehouses, to do a better job with automating [Indiscernible] AI is going to make it possible for all of these types of automation to finally be realized... And so, the dynamics are all very different.
That last one has to do with Edge AI, which was just made possible bond, putting AI [Indiscernible] at the point of data, and rather than a point of action, because you need to be low cost, you need to be high performance, instantly responsive, and you can afford to stream all of the data to the cloud all the time. And so, each one of them has a probably difficulty. Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Silgan Stein of Chewy Securities. Your line is open. Great, thanks so much for taking my question. Gentlemen, I'm wondering if you can talk for a moment about Omniverse. This looks like really cool technology, but I tend to get very few questions from investors about it, but it looks to me like this could be a potentially very meaningful technology for you longer-term.
Can you explain perhaps what capabilities and what markets this is going after? It looks like, perhaps this is going to position you very well in augmented and virtual reality, but maybe, maybe it's a certain different market or group of markets. It's a bit confusing to us, so if you could maybe help us understand it, I think we'd really appreciate it. Thank you. I really appreciate the question. And it's one of the most important things we're doing. The Omniverse, first of all, just what is it? Is a stimulator, is a simulator that's finically accurate [Indiscernible]. And it was made possible because of 2 fundamental technologies we invented, of them is, of course, RTX, the ability to, to physically stimulate light behavior in the world, which is very fixing.
The second is the ability to comp compute or simulate the physics of simulating the artificial intelligence behavior of agents and objects instead of the world. So, we have the ability now to simulate physics in a realistic way and to create an architecture that allows us to do it in the cloud, distributed computed way, and to be able to scale it out to a very large [Indiscernible] So the question is what would you do with such a frame.
The simulator, there is a simulation of virtual worlds with portals with columns with connectors, portals based on an industry-standard, open standard that was pioneered by Pixar, and as we mentioned earlier, that we're partnering with Pixar, and Apple to make it even broadly adopted -- more broadly adopted, it's called Universal Scene Description.
So basically, portals or wormholes into virtual worlds. And this virtual world will simulate to be simulated to be a concert for consumers, if the, if the hard for consumers in the world of industries, you could use it for simulating robots. So, the robots can learn how to be robots inside these virtual worlds before they're downloaded from the simulator to the real world. You could use it to simulate factories, which is one of the early works that will downward BMW got a shared GTC.
Factory of the future that is designed completely in Omniverse, robots [Indiscernible] Omniverse with goods and materials that its original CAD data put into the battery. The logistics plan, like an ERP system, except this an ERP system of physical grids and physical simulation simulated through this Omniverse world, and you could plan the entire factory in Omniverse. This entire factory now becomes what is called the digital screen.
In fact, it could be a factor, it could be a stadium, it could be an airport, it could be an entire city, it could even include the cars. The digital twin would allow us to simulate new algorithms, new AI's, new and optimization algorithms. Before we deploy it into the physical world. And so, what is Omniverse? Well, Omniverse is going to be an overlay, if you will, of virtual worlds, that increasingly people call the [Indiscernible].
And we've now heard several companies talk about the Metaverse, we all come from different perspectives. Some of them from social perspectives, some of you from a gaming perspective, some of them, in our case, from an industrial and design and engineering perspective. But the Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the internet an overlay of the physical world in terms of fused all of these different worlds together long-term.
And you'll be able to, you mentioned VR, and now you'll be able to go into the Omniverse world using virtual reality. And so, you have a wormhole into the virtual worlds in the VR. You could have an AI or an object [Indiscernible] into our world, using augmented reality so you could have a beautiful piece of art, that you somehow purchased for a long two-year because of NFC.
It's only enjoyed in the virtual roaming and you can overweight it into your physical world given AI. I'm fairly sure at this point that Omniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy. And we'll have long enjoyed a lot of our time in the future in Omniverse and the Metaverse, and we'll do a lot of our work there, and we'll have a lot of robots. They're doing a lot of the work on our behalf. We've got the [Indiscernible], they show the results.
So Omniverse to us is an extension of our AI strategy, is an extension of our high-performance computers [Indiscernible] and it makes it possible for companies and industries to be able to create digital twain's that simulate their physical version before they deploy it or while they are operating. Thank you. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Thank you. Have we had an excellent quarter fueled by surging demand for NVIDIA computing? Our pioneering work in accelerated computing continues to [Indiscernible] graphics, scientific computing with AI, enabled by NVIDIA [Indiscernible] computing developers are creating the most impactful technologies of our time.
From natural language understanding, and [Indiscernible] systems, to autonomous vehicles in the logistics centers. digital biology and climate science research. The Metaverse world, but obeys the laws of physics. This quarter we announced NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command to develop deploy, scale, and orchestrate the AI workflow that runs on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.
With our new Enterprise Software, a wide range of NVIDIA-powered systems, and a global network of system and integration partners. We can accelerate the world's largest industry as they raised the benefits of the transformative power of AI. We are thrilled to have launched NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform, nearly five years in the making.
That runs physically realistic virtual worlds and connects to other digital platforms. We imagined engineers, designers, and even a tournament machine connecting to Omniverse to create digital twin, unrelated worlds, that helped train robots, operating autonomous factories, simulate fleets and autonomous vehicles, and even predict the human impact on Earth's climate. The future will have artificial intelligence augmenting our own and the Metaverse augmenting our physical world.
It will be populated by real and AI visitors, and open new opportunities for artists, designers, scientists and even businesses, a whole new digital economy, Omniverse is a platform for building the Metaverse division. We're doing some of our best work and most impactful work in our history. I want to thank all of NVIDIA's employees for the remaining work and the exciting future we're inventing together.

Q3 was another exceptional quarter with record revenue of $4.73 billion, up 57% year-on-year, up 22% sequentially and well above our outlook. Our new NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture is ramping with excellent demand across our major market platforms. Q3 was also a landmark quarter, both for us and the industry as a whole. As we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion, we are incredibly excited about the combined company’s opportunities and we are working through the regulatory approval process. For today, we will focus our remarks on our quarterly performance.
Starting with gaming. Revenue was a record $2.27 billion, up 37% year-on-year, up 37% sequentially, and ahead of our high expectations. Driving strong growth was our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GeForce RTX 30 series of gaming GPUs. The GeForce RTX 3070, 3080 and 3090 GPUs offer up to two times the performance and two times the power efficiency over the previous Turing-based generation. Our second generation NVIDIA RTX combines ray tracing and AI to deliver the greatest ever generational leap in performance.
First announced on September 1st and ranging in price from $499 to $1,499, these GPUs have generated amazing reviews and overwhelming demand. PC World called them staggeringly powerful, while Newegg cited more traffic than Black Friday. Many of our retail and e-tail partners sold out instantly, the RTX 30 series drove our biggest ever launch.
While we had anticipated strong demand, it exceeded even our bullish expectations. Given industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times, it may take a few more months for product availability to catch up with demand.
In addition to the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, we announced powerful new tools for gamers as well as for tens of millions of live streamers, broadcasters, eSports professionals, artists and creators. NVIDIA Reflex is a new technology that improves reaction time in games, reducing system latency by up to 58%. NVIDIA Reflex is being integrated into popular eSports games, such as Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite and Valorant.
NVIDIA Broadcast is a universal plugin for video conferencing and live streaming applications that enhances the quality of microphones, speakers and webcams with NVIDIA AI effects such as audio noise removal, virtual background effects, and webcam audio frame. With this, remote workers and live streamers can turn any room into a broadcast studio.
Blockbuster games continue to adopt NVIDIA’s RTX ray tracing and AI technology. Epic Games announced that Fortnite, which has more than 350 million players worldwide, is adding NVIDIA RTX real-time ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS AI super-resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, making the game more beautiful and even more responsive. Other major new titles featuring RTX this holiday season include Watch Dogs: Legion, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and much anticipated Cyberpunk 2077.
Gaming laptop demand was also strong with double-digit year-on-year growth for the 11th quarter in a row. NVIDIA GeForce laptops support the most demanding applications for creators and designers while doubling as a powerful gaming [indiscernible]. We also have record gaming console revenue on strong demand for the Nintendo Switch.
And we continue to grow our cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, which has doubled in the past seven months to reach over 5 million registered users. GeForce NOW is unique as an open platform that connects to popular game stores, including Steam, Epic Games, and Ubisoft Connect, allowing gamers access to the titles they already own.
750 games are currently available on GFN, the most of any cloud gaming platforms, including 75 free to play games, with more games added every Thursday. GFN supports many popular clients, including PCs, Macs and Chromebooks. Stay tuned for more devices to come in the near future.
In addition, GFN’s reach continues to expand through our telco partners in a growing list of countries, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. We are also providing technology that enables the cloud gaming services to an expanding number of partners. Following our earlier announcement with Tencent, Amazon and Facebook are beginning to offer cloud gaming services powered by NVIDIA.
Moving to ProViz, Q3 revenue was $236 million, down 27% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially, ahead of our expectations. Sequential growth was driven by strength in notebooks, which posted record revenue, boosted by work-from-home initiatives and a shift to thin and light mobile workstations. This is particularly offset by decline in desktop workstations, which continued to be impacted by the pandemic and drove the year-on-year decline.
From an industry demand perspective, stronger verticals including healthcare, public sector, higher education and research, and financial services, we continue to win new business in a number of areas. In healthcare, we added Medtronic for visual surgical applications and [indiscernible] for medical imaging.
In technology and media and entertainment, we gained wins for design, rendering and broadcast applications. During the quarter, we announced the Omniverse, the world’s first 3D collaboration and simulation platforms has entered open beta. Omniverse enables the tens of millions of designers, architects and creators to collaborate real time, on-premises or remotely. Fusing the virtual and physical worlds, Omniverse brings together NVIDIA breakthroughs in graphics, simulation and AI. It will help enterprises address evolving requirements as workforces become increasingly distributed. Initial market response from this transformative platform has been phenomenal. Over 400 individual creators and developers in diverse industries have been evaluating Omniverse, and early adopters including Ericsson, BMW, Foster and Partners, and Lucasfilm.
The pandemic is accelerating development of AR, VR and mixed reality technologies, which will have a profound impact on how we work and play. For example, our work with NASCAR to enable a variety of AR and VR services at the edge is revolutionizing the racing experience for millions of fans across the globe. With our industry-leading real-time ray tracing graphics, AI and simulation hardware and software stacks, NVIDIA is in a unique position to enable the future of blending the physical and virtual worlds.
Moving to automotive, Q3 revenue was $125 million, down 23% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven by a recovery in global automotive production volumes, as well as continued growth in AI cockpit revenue. The year-on-year decline was due to the expected ramp-down of legacy infotainment revenue. In September, Mercedes-Benz debuted its redesign of S-class sedan, featuring an all new NVIDIA powered MBUX AI cockpit system with an augmented reality heads-up display, AI voice assistant, and rich interactive graphics to enable every passenger in the vehicle to enjoy personalized, intelligent features.
Also in September, Li Auto, a leading electric car brand in China announced that it will develop its next generation of vehicles using the software defined NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin platform. Orin delivers nearly 7 times the performance and 3 times the energy efficiency of our previous generation SOC, making it uniquely capable to power next generation autonomous electric vehicles. We have excellent traction with EV startups.
Finally, last week NVIDIA and Hyundai Motor Group announced that the automaker’s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will come standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems, starting in 2022. This feature-rich software-defined computing platform will allow vehicles to be perpetually upgraded with the latest AI cockpit features.
Now moving to data center. Revenue was a record $1.9 billion, up 162% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, driving growth with a strong ramp of our A100-based platforms, continued growth with Mellanox and record T4 shipments for inference. Let me give you a little bit of color on each.
Our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture gained further adoption by cloud and hyperscale customers and started ramping into vertical industries. Over the past weeks, Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Alibaba Cloud announced general availability of the A100, following Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure. A100 adoption by vertical industries drove strong growth, as we began shipments to server OEM partners whose broad enterprise channels reach a large number of end customers.
We also ramped the DGX A100 server and began shipping NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the first turnkey AI infrastructure. These range from 20 to 140 DGX A100 systems interconnected with Mellanox’s HDR InfiniBand networking and enable customers to install incredibly powerful AI supercomputers in just a few weeks’ time.
In fact, we have announced plans to build an 80-node DGX SuperPOD with 400 petaflops of AI performance, called Cambridge-1, which will be in the UK’s fastest AI supercomputer. So, it will be used by NVIDIA researchers for collaborative research within the UK’s AI and healthcare community across academia, industry and startups. It joins other systems in NVIDIA’s complex of AI supercomputers powered by our R&D and autonomous vehicles, conversational AI, robotics, graphics, HPC and other domains. This includes Selene, now the world’s fifth fastest supercomputer and fastest commercial supercomputer and a new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which ranks first on the Green500 list of the world’s most energy efficient supercomputers.
A great example of the tremendous opportunities for AI in healthcare is our new partnership with GSK, for applying computational to the drug and vaccine discovery process. GSK’s London-based AI hub will utilize biomedical data, AI methods, and advanced computing platforms to unlock genetic and clinical data with increased precision and scale. In addition to this investment in NVIDIA’s DGX A100 system, GSK will have access to NVIDIA’s Cambridge-1, the NVIDIA drug discovery software and NVIDIA scientists.
In Q3, the A100 swept the industry standard MLPerf benchmark for AI inference performance, following our suite in the prior quarter’s MLPerf benchmark for AI training. Notably, our performance was in AI inference actually extended compared with last year’s benchmark. For example, in the ResNet-50 test for image recognition, our A100 GPU beat CPU-only systems by 30 times this year versus 6 times last year. Additionally, A100 outperformed CPUs by up to 237 times in the newly added recommend data test, which represents some of the most complex and widely used AI models on the internet.
Our winning performance in AI inference is translating to continued strong revenue growth. Alongside the continued ramp of the A100, T4 sales set a record as the NVIDIA AI inference adoption is in full throttle. We estimate that NVIDIA installed GPU capacity for inference across the seven largest public clouds now exceeds that of the aggregate CPU capacity in the cloud, testament to the tremendous performance and TCO advantage of our GPUs.
Hundreds of companies now operate AI-enabled services on NVIDIA’s inference platforms, including the A100 or T4 GPU, and our Triton, inference serving software. For example, Tencent uses NVIDIA AI inference to recommend video, music, news and apps, supporting billions of queries per day. Microsoft uses NVIDIA AI inference for grammar correction in Microsoft Office, supporting 0.5 trillion queries a year. And American Express uses it for real-time fraud detection.
We also gained tremendous traction in supercomputing. We announced that NVIDIA technology, including Ampere architecture GPUs, and HDR InfiniBand networking will power five systems awarded by EuroHPC, a European initiative to build extra scale supercomputing. This includes CINECA, a university consortium in Italy and one of the world’s most important supercomputing centers, which will use NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform to build the world’s fastest AI supercomputer.
CINECA supercomputer named Leonardo advances the age of exascale AI, delivering 10 exaflops of AI performance to enable AI and high-performance computing converge applications use cases. It is built with nearly 14,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and Mellanox HDR 200 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking. And just released top 500 list of supercomputers show that NVIDIA GPUs or network empowered nearly 70%, and 8 of the 10 top supercomputers on the list.
Mellanox had another record quarter with double-digit sequential growth well ahead of our expectations, contributing 13% of overall Company revenue. The upside reflected sales to China OEM that will not recur in Q4. As a result, we expect a meaningful sequential revenue decline from Mellanox in Q4, but still growing 30% from last year. Mellanox reached record revenue in both InfiniBand and Ethernet, driven by cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. Strong demand for high-performance interconnects where Mellanox is leader is being fueled by AI increasingly complex applications, which demand faster, smarter, more scalable networks.
As the data center becomes the new unit of computing in the age of AI, Mellanox networking is foundational to modern scalable architectures.
At GTC in October, we unveiled the BlueField-2 DPU, or data processing unit, a new kind of processor, which offloads critical networking, storage and security tasks from the CPU. A single BlueField-2 DPU can deliver the same data center services that consume up to 125 CPU cores. This frees up valuable CPU cores to run a wide range of other enterprise applications. In addition, it enables zero trust security features to prevent data breaches and cyber attacks and accelerates overall performance.
VMware announced that it will offload, accelerate and isolate its industry leading ESXi hypervisor with NVIDIA’s BlueField-2 DPU, boosting vSphere and data center performance and efficiency. We also unveiled our three-year DPU roadmap, unified Mellanox’s leading network capabilities with NVIDIA’s GPUs and the new NVIDIA DOCA or data-center-on-a-chip architecture. Software development kit for building DPU accelerated applications. We believe that over time DPUs will ship a millions of servers, unlocking a $10 billion total addressable market. BlueField-2 is sampling now with major hyperscale customers and will be integrated into the enterprise server offerings of major OEMs.
This was our busy period for product launches. Earlier this week at Supercomputing 2020, we announced the new double capacity, A100 80 gigabyte GPUs and DGX systems for organizations to build, train and deploy massive AI models. We also announced the new DGX Station A100, a powerful workgroup server with four A100 GPUs and a massive 320 gigabyte GPU memory for data scientists and AI researchers working in offices, research facilities, labs or at home. All these additions to the NVIDIA Ampere architecture family of products will be available early next year.
At SC20, we also announced the next generation NVIDIA Mellanox 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand architecture, giving AI developers and scientific researchers the fastest available networking performance. This doubles data throughput and adds new in network computing engine to provide additional acceleration. Solutions based on this new architecture are expected to sample in the second quarter of calendar 2021.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margin was 62.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 65.5%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year, primarily due to charges related to the Mellanox acquisition, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was driven by the absence of non-recurring inventory step-up expense related to the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 140 basis points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales, including the contribution from Mellanox. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations, driven by product mix.
Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $1.56 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 6% and 42% from a year ago, respectively. Q3 GAAP, EPS was $2.12, up 46% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.91, up 63% from a year ago. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.28 billion.
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, Q4 includes a 14th week, which we expect to be incrementally -- addition to revenue and operating expenses. We expect gaming to be up sequentially in what is typically a seasonally down quarter, as we continue to ramp up our new RTX 30 Series products. We expect data center to be down slightly versus Q3. With that, we expect computing products to grow in the mid-single-digit sequentially, more than offset by sequential decline in Mellanox. We expect continued sequential growth in auto and ProViz but not yet returning to year-on-year growth. And we expect a seasonal decline in OEM.
Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.8% and 65.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.64 billion and $1.1 8 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We’ll be virtually attending the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on November 30th, Wells Fargo TMT Summit December 1st and the UBS TMT Conference on December 7th. Our earnings call to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 24th.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Just Colette, going back to your commentary around Mellanox, it seems like you’re guiding the January quarter to about $500 million, which means the core data center business is still growing nicely, call it, 6%, 7% sequentially. I’m just kind of curious, when you look at the core data center business, I know there’s not a direct correlation to server business. But, we’re clearly going through a cloud digestion in server and core vertical markets, enterprise, the servers are weak. When you look at your core data center business, do you feel as though that’s having an impact, and this is sort of the digestion that you saw kind of in late fiscal ‘20 -- sorry, fiscal ‘19 into ‘20, but you’re doing it still growing significantly year-over-year, or how would you characterize the macro backdrop? Sure. Let me clarify for those also on the call. Yes, we expect our data center revenue in total to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The computing products, NVIDIA computing product is expected to grow in the mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter as we continue the NVIDIA AI adoption and particularly as A100 continues to ramp.
Our networking, our Mellanox networking is expected to decline meaningful quarter-over-quarter as sales to that China OEM will not recur in Q4, though we still expect the results to be growth of 30% or more year-over-year. The timing of some of this business therefore shifted from Q4 to Q3, but overall H2 is quite strong.
So, in referring to overall digestion, the hyperscale business remains extremely strong. We expect hyperscale to grow quarter-over-quarter in computing products as A100 continues to ramp. The A100 continues to gain adoption, not only across those hyperscale customers, but again we’re also receiving great momentum in inferencing with the A100 and the T4.
I’ll turn it over here to Jensen to see if he has more that he would like to add. Yes. Colette captured it very well. The only thing I would add is that our inference initiative is really gaining great momentum. Inference is one of the hardest computer science problems. Compiling these gigantic neural network computational graphs into a target device really, really -- has proven to be really, really hard. The models are diverse when you count vision to language to speech. And there are so many different types of models being created that model sizes are doubling every couple of months. The latency expectations are increasing all the time, -- or latency is decreasing all the time. And so, the pressure on inference is really great. The technology pressure is really great. And our leadership there is really pulling ahead. We’re in our seventh generation tensorRT.
We, over the course of the last couple of years, developed an inference server. It’s called Triton, has been adopted all over the place. We have several hundred customers now using NVIDIA AI to deploy their AI services. This is in the early innings, and I think this is going to be our largest near-term growth opportunity. So, we’re really firing on all cylinders there between the A100s ramping in the cloud, A100s beginning to ramp in enterprise, and all of our inference initiatives are really doing great. Jensen, maybe to follow on there just on the vertical markets, clearly work-from-home and COVID this year kind of presented a headwind to new technology deployments on-prem. I’m kind of curious, if we expect sort of an enterprise recovery in general next year, how do you think that will translate into your vertical market strategy? And is there anything else above and beyond that you can do to help accelerate penetration of AI into that end market? Yes. John, that’s a good point. I mean, it’s very clear that the inability to go to work is slowing down the adoption of new technology in some of the verticals. Of course, we’re seeing rapid adoption in certain verticals, like for example using AI in health care to rapidly discover new vaccines and early detection with outbreaks and robotic applications. So, warehouses, digital retail, last mile delivery, we’re just seeing just really, really great enthusiasm around adopting new AI and robotics technology. But in some of the more traditional industries, new capabilities and new technologies are slow to deploy.
One of the areas that I’m really super excited about is the work that we’re doing in remote work and making it possible for people to collaborate remotely. We have a platform called Omniverse. It’s in early beta. The feedback from the marketplace has been really great. And so, I’ve got a lot more to report to you guys in the upcoming months around Omniverse. And so -- but anyways, I think, when the industry recover, we serve -- our fundamental purpose as a company is to solve the greatest challenges that impact the industry where ordinary computers can’t. And these challenges are -- serve some of the most important applications in the verticals that we address. And they’re not commodity applications. They’re really impactful, needle-moving applications.
So, I have every confidence that when the industries recover, things will get designed. Cars will be designed, and planes will be designed, and ships will be designed, and buildings will be designed. And we’re going to see a lot of design, and we’re going to see a lot of simulation. We’re going to see a lot of robotics applications. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. You talked about in your prepared remarks limited availability of capacity components. You suggested perhaps a few months to catch up. Curious if you can speak to the visibility that you have for both, gaming and data center into your April quarter? Yes. Colette, do you want me to take that real quick and maybe you can help me out? Yes, absolutely. So, C.J., first off, we have a lot of visibility into the channel, as you know, especially for gaming. And we know how many weeks of inventory is in what parts of the channel. We’ve been draining down the channel inventory for Turing for some time. And meanwhile, we’ve also expected a very, very successful launch with Ampere. And even with our bullish demand expectation and all of the Amperes that we built, which is one of the fastest ramps ever, the demand is still overwhelming. And this I guess in a lot of ways is kind of expected, the circumstances are -- it’s been a decade since we’ve invented a new type of computer graphics. I mean, two years ago, we invented [indiscernible] and it set the industry on course to create the type of images that we see today. But, it’s very clear that the future is going to look something much, much more beautiful. And we invented NVIDIA RTX to do that. And it has two capabilities, one based on ray tracing and the other one is based on artificial intelligence image generation. The combination of those two capabilities is creating images that people are pretty ecstatic about. And at this point, it’s defined the next-generation content.
And so when we -- it took us 10 years to invent it. We launched it two years ago and took our second generation to really achieve the level of quality and performance that the industry -- that they really expect. And now, the demand is just overwhelming. And so, we’re going to continue to ramp fast. And this is going to be one of our most successful ramps ever. And it gives our installed base of some 200-million-plus GeForce gamers the best reason to upgrade in over a decade. And so, this is going to be a very large generation for us is my guess.
And then, with respect to data center, we’re ramping into A100. A100 is our first generation of GPUs that does several things at the same time. It’s universal. We position it as a universal because it’s able to do all of the applications that we in the past had to have multiple GPUs to do. It does training well. It does inference incredibly well. It does high-performance computing. It does data analytics. And so, it’s able -- the Ampere architecture is able to do all of this at the same time. And so, the utilization for data centers is -- and the utility is really, really fantastic, and the reception has been great. And so, we’re going to ramp into all of the world’s clouds. I think, starting this quarter, we’re now in every major cloud provider in the world, including Alibaba or Golan, [ph] and of course the giants, the Amazon, the Azure and Google Clouds. And we’re going to continue to ramp into that. And then, of course, we’re starting to ramp into enterprise, which in my estimation, long term will still be the largest growth opportunity for us, turning every industry into a AI, turning every company into AIs and augment it with Al and bringing the iPhone moment to all of the world’s largest industries. And so, we’re ramping into that, and we’re seeing a great deal of enthusiasm. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. You said that the extra week was contributing incrementally to revenue and OpEx. Can you give us some feeling for how much is contributing to revenue and OpEx in Q4? And does that impact, at least on the revenue side, differ, say between like gaming and data center? And then, how should we think about it impacting seasonality into Q1 as that extra week rolls off? Sure. Let me try this one, Jensen. Yes, we’ve incorporated that 14th week into our guidance for both, revenue and OpEx. We will likely have incrementally positive impact on revenue, although it is tough to quantify, okay? Our outlook also reflects incremental OpEx for Q4 in primarily two different areas in terms of compensation and depreciation. And given that our employees with such a material power of our OpEx, it will -- it can be close to one-fourteenth of the quarter.
Now, when we look a little bit farther, we should think about the incremental positive in both, gaming and data center from that extra week as there hopefully will be extra supply, but not likely as much as one-fourteenth of the quarter of revenue as enterprise demand is essentially project-based, and game demand though is tied to the number of gaming that gamers that might be shopping for the overall holiday. So, again, still very hard for us to determine at this time. Normally, between Q4 and Q1 there is seasonality in gaming, seasonality downward. But, we’ll just have to see as we are still supply-constrained within this Q4 to see what that looks like.
From an OpEx standpoint, we’ll probably expect our OpEx to be relatively flattish as we move from Q4 to Q1. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth. Jensen, my question is on competition from internally designed products by some of your larger cloud customers, Amazon and Google and others. We hear about competition from time to time. And I wanted to get your perspective. Is this a manageable risk? Is the right way to think that they are perhaps using more of your product in their public cloud, but they are moving to internal products for internal workloads? Just how should we think about this risk going forward? Thank you. Thanks, Vivek. Most of the cloud vendors, in fact, I believe all of the cloud vendors use the same infrastructures largely for their internal cloud and external cloud, or have the ability to or largely do. And, there’s -- the competition, we find to be really good. And the reason for that is this. It just suggests that acceleration -- they make it very clear, that acceleration is right path forward for training and inference. The vast majority of the world’s training models are doubling in size every couple of months, and it’s one of the reasons where our demand is so great. The second is inference. The vast majority of the world’s inference is not on CPUs. And nothing is better than the whole world recognizing that the best way forward is to do inference on accelerators. And when that happens, our accelerator is the most versatile. It is the highest performance. We move the fastest. Our rate of innovation is the fastest because we’re also the most dedicated to it, we’re most committed to it, and we have the largest team in the world to it. Our stack is the most advanced, giving us the greatest versatility and performance. And so, we see spots of announcement here and there. But, they’re also our largest customers. And as you know that we’re ramping quite nicely at Google, we’re ramping quite nicely at Amazon and Microsoft and Alibaba and Oracle and others.
And so, I think, the big takeaway is that -- and the great opportunity for us if you look at the vast amount of workload -- AI workload in the world, the vast majority of it today is still on CPUs. And it’s very clear that this is going to be an accelerated workload. And we’re the best accelerator in the world. And, this is going to be a really big growth opportunity for us in near term. In fact, we believe it’s our largest growth opportunity in near term. And we’re in the early innings of it. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and great job on the quarterly execution. The Mellanox networking connectivity business was up 80% year-over-year. I think, it was up about 13%, 14% sequentially. I know there was upside in October from one China customer, but it did grow 70% year-over-year last quarter, and you’re still expecting 30% year-over-year growth next quarter. If I remember correctly, I think, InfiniBand is about 40% of that business; Ethernet Cloud is about 60%. Jensen, what are the big drivers, especially since we’re in the midst of a cloud spending digestion cycle? And I just saw that the team announced their next-gen 400-gig InfiniBand solution, which should drive another strong adoption cycle with your supercomputer customers. When does this upgrade cycle start to fire? Yes. Let’s see. Our data center business consists of supercomputing centers, which is small, high-performance computing, which is a much larger part of super computing, much larger than supercomputing, and then hyperscale and enterprise, which about 50-50. Of the data center business, the accelerated computing part is not very much associated with digestion than others. It’s much more associated with workloads and our new product cycles, the TCO that we bring in and AI inference, the type of models that the cloud service providers are deploying, whether they’re deploying new AI models, based on deep learning, and how much of it that we -- how much of those workloads that we’ve completed, the porting to our accelerators and ready it for deployment. And so, those are the factors associated with accelerated computing. It’s really about the apps, it’s really about the workloads and really driven by AI.
On the other hand, the networking part of our business is more connected to CPU business because they’re much more broad-based. The networking part of our business is driven by this idea of new hyperscale data center architecture called disaggregation. It’s software disaggregation, not necessarily hardware disaggregation. Software disaggregation, where this type of software called Kubernetes orchestrate microservices that are deployed across the data center. So, one service, one application isn’t monolithic running on one computer anymore. It’s distributed across multiple computers and multiple nodes, so that the hyperscale data centers can more easily scale up and scale out according to the workloads and according to the demand on the data center.
And so, this disaggregation has caused the networking between the compute nodes to be of all vital importance. And because Mellanox is the lowest-latency, highest-performance, highest-bandwidth network that you can get the TCO benefit at the data center scale is really fantastic. And so, when they’re building out data centers, Mellanox is going to be much more connected to that.
In the enterprise side of it, depending on new CPU cycles, it could affect them. If a CPU cycle were to delay a little bit, it would affect them by a quarter, it would pull-in by a quarter -- it would affect them by pull-in of a quarter. And so, those are kind of the dynamics of it.
I think, that the net-net of it is that it’s a foregone conclusion at this point that AI is going to be the future of the way software is run. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. And acceleration is the best path forward. And so, that’s what drives our computing business.
And the networking business has everything to do with the way architecture of data centers, cloud data centers, which is architected with micro services now. And that’s what foundationally drives their -- our networking work business demand. And so, we’re really well-positioned in these two fundamental dynamics because as we know, AI is the future and cloud computing is the future. Both of those dynamics are very favorable to us. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask a question that was asked before in a bit of a different way. If I look at the core business, excluding Mellanox, the core data center business, it was up about 6% sequentially the past two quarters, and your guidance sort of implies up about that much again in January, which is certainly good, and there is some cloud digestion. But, of course you have Ampere still ramping as well, which should be a pretty good tailwind. So, there seems to be some offsetting factors. So, I guess, I wonder if you feel like your core data center revenue is still being constrained right now by some market digestion. And kind of how you sort of balance or handicap these two factors? Thanks. Our growth is -- in the near term is more affected by the cycle time of manufacturing and flexibility of supply. We are in a good shape to -- and all of our supply is -- informs our guidance. But, we would appreciate shorter cycle times; we would appreciate more agile supply chains. But, the world is constrained at the moment. And so, we just have to make the best of it. But, even in that condition - even in that condition, we’ve -- all of that is building for our guidance, and we expect to grow. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to kind of the Mellanox question. I know prior to the acquisition, Mellanox was growing maybe in the mid to high-20% range. These last two quarters, it’s grown over 75%. I guess, the simple question is how do you think about the growth rate for Mellanox going forward? And on that topic, we started to hear you talk more about BlueField and data processing units. I think, in your commentary, you alluded to server OEM design wins incorporating these DPUs. What are you looking at, or when should we think about the DPU business really starting to inflect and become a material driver for the business? Thank you. Long term, every computer in the world will be built like a data center. And every node of a data center is going to be a data center in itself. And the reason for that is because we want the attack surface to be basically zero. And today, most of the data centers are only protected as a periphery. But in the future, if you would like cloud computing to be the architecture for everything and every data center is multi-tenant, every data center is secure, then you’re going to have to secure every single node. And each one of those nodes are going to be a software-defined networking, software-defined storage, and it’s going to have per application security. And so, the processing that it will need to offload, the CPUs, is really quite significant. In fact, we believe that somewhere between 20% to 40% of today’s data centers -- cloud data centers is the capacity, the throughput, the computational load is consumed running basically the infrastructure overhead.
And that’s what the DPUs intended -- was designed to do. We’re going to offload that, number one; and number two, we’re going to make every single application secure. And confidential competing, zero trust computing will become a reality. And so, the importance is really quite tremendous. And I believe therefore that every single server in the world will have a DPU inside someday, just because we care so much about security and just because we care so much about throughput and TCO. And it’s really the most cost-effective way of building a data center. And so, I expect our DPU business to be quite large.
And so, that’s the reason why we’re putting so much energy into it. It’s a programmable data center on a chip, think of that way, and data center infrastructure on a chip. It is the reason why we’re working with VMware on taking the operating system in the data center, the software-defined operating system in the data center, putting bring it on BlueField. And so, this is a very important initiative for us. I’m very excited about it, as you can imagine. Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you very much. Colette -- and I apologize if I missed it, but for Mellanox, do you expect it to get back to the growth trajectory on a sequential basis in the April quarter? And I’m assuming that the shortfall in the current quarter is from a pull-in from Huawei? So, our impact to our Q4 guidance for Mellanox, yes, is impacted by a sale to a China OEM for Mellanox. That will not recur in Q4. And as we look forth into Q1 of April, we’re going to take this a quarter at a time and provide thoughts and guidance for that once we turn the corner to the new fiscal year. At the highest level, Colette, I think, the -- it’s safe to say that high-speed networking is going to be one of the most important things in cloud data centers as we go forward. And the vast majority of the world’s data center is still built for the traditional hyper-converged architecture, which is all moving over to microservices-based disaggregate --software-defined disaggregated architectures. And that journey is still in its early days. And so, I fully expect future cloud data centers -- all future data centers are going to be connected with high-speed networking inside. They call it east-west traffic. And, all of the traffic will be secured. And so, imagine building firewalls into every single server. And imagine every single transaction, every single transmission inside the data center to be high speed and fully encrypted. And so, pretty amazing amount of computation is going to have to be installed into future data centers. But, that’s an accepted requirement now. And I think, our networking business, Mellanox is in the early innings of growth. Your final question today comes from the line of William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. You’ve given us some pieces of this puzzle. But, I’m hoping maybe you can address directly the sort of SKU-by-SKU rollout of Ampere. We know that we didn’t have a ton of SKUs last quarter. There were more in this quarter that you just announced. Now, you’re doing sort of this refresh it sounds like with double the memory on the A100. Is the T4 going to be refreshed? And if so, when does that happen? And, are there other, either systems or chips that are still waiting for the Ampere refresh that could potentially contribute to an extended cycle as we look at the next year? Yes. In terms of the total number of SKUs that we’ve ramped of Ampere, we’re probably somewhere along a third to a half of the SKUs at this point, maybe a little bit less. Yes, it’s less. The way that you could think through it, you could reverse engineer it, it is like this. You know what our gaming lineup looks like for desktops. And so, traditionally, we try to have a new architecture in every single segment. And we’ve not gone below 499 yet. And so, there’s a very big part of the marketplace that we’re still in the process of addressing. And then, the second thing is laptops. None of the Ampere architecture has launched for laptops. And then, there’s workstations. And you do the same thing with desktops and workstations and laptops workstations. And none of those have gone out yet.
And then, there’s data center. And our data center business for cloud, you’ve seen some of the early versions of it, A100. But, then, there’s cloud computing for graphics, there’s cloud gaming. For those enterprise, edge enterprise applications, enterprise data analytics applications. And so, there’s a fair number of exciting new products we still have in front of us. That concludes our Q&A for today. I now turn the call back to Ms. Jankowski for closing remarks. Actually, that will be for Jensen. My apologies. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Simona.
This was a terrific quarter. NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. And the RTX has reinvented graphics and has made real-time ray tracing the standard of next generation content, creating the best ever reason to upgrade for hundreds of millions of NVIDIA gamers. AI, where software writes software no humans can, is the most powerful technology force of our time and is impacting every industry. NVIDIA AI again swept MLPerf training and now inference as well, extending our leadership in this important new way of doing computing.
NVIDIA AI’s new Triton inference server, a platform that I will speak a lot more about in the future and a lot more frequently because it’s important, and our full stack optimized platform are gaining rapid adoption to operate many of the world’s most popular AI-enhanced services, opening a major growth opportunity. Data centers are the new unit of computing. Someday, we believe there will be millions of autonomous data centers distributed all over the globe.
NVIDIA’s BlueField DPU programmable data center on a chip and our rich software stack will help place AI data centers in factories, warehouses, 5G base stations and even on wheels. And with our pending acquisition of Arm, the company that builds the world’s most popular CPU, we will create the computing company for the age of AI, with computing extending from the cloud to trillions of devices.
Thank you for joining us today. I wish all of you happy holidays. And please do stay safe, and I look forward to seeing you guys next time. That concludes today’s conference call.

Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with revenue up 53% year-on-year to $7.6 billion. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Full year revenue was a record $26.9 billion, up 61%, compounding the prior year's growth of 53%. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.4 billion rose 6% sequentially and was up 37% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 61%. Gaming has become the top entertainment medium that continues to show strong momentum. Just last month, Steam hit a record 28 million concurrent users, up 50% in 2 years. Record desktop revenue in the quarter was led by our growth in our GeForce RTX 30 Series products with continued strength in the high end. At CES, we announced the RTX 3050 GPO, which hit retail in late January, bringing NVIDIA RTX and AI technologies to more mainstream audiences. Laptop gaming revenue also set a record, driven by the ramp of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 GPUs, which were also announced at CES. These leverage our fourth-generation Max-Q technology to enable quiet and light gaming laptops. All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA and tier architecture RTX 30 Series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators driving the future of design, innovation and virtual world. In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 Series GPUs, Studio laptops future support for NVIDIA software with Omniverse, Tundus and Broadcast. Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low. NVIDIA RTX ecosystem continues to expand with over 30 new RTX games and applications added this quarter, including blockbuster hit like Battlefield 2042, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty: Vanguard and God of War. In addition, several new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low-latency impact. Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, so we have limited visibility into how much of this impacts our overall GPU demand. Nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are light cache rate to help direct GeForce supply to gamers. Cryptomining processor revenue was $24 million, which is included in OEM and other. We continue to expand the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming ecosystem with new hit titles, including EA's Battlefield 4 and Battlefield V. At CES, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate GeForce NOW in its smart TVs starting in Q2 of this year. This follows last month's beta release of the GeForce NOW for LG smart TVs. In addition, we teamed up with AT&T to bring GeForce NOW to 5G mobile devices in the U.S. We also added our first GFN data center in Canada. Moving to pro visualization. Q4 revenue was $643 million was up 11% sequentially and up 109% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $2.1 billion was up 100%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a shift to higher-value workstation and the continued ramp of our NVIDIA health care architecture. We believe strong demand is fueled by continued build-outs for hybrid work environment as well as growth in key workloads, including design, AI and rendering. For example, Sony Pictures ImageWorks is using NVIDIA RTX to accelerate ray-tracing for rendering related applications. Motion is using NVIDIA RTX for AI to assist in predictive maintenance of the vehicles. And Duke Energy is using NVIDIA RTX for AI and VR to map, view and maintain energy facilities. NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise software entered general availability. And while it's still in early days, customer feedback so far has been very positive, with multiple significant enterprise licensees already signed. In addition to software licenses, Omniverse also drives computing opportunity for NVIDIA RTX in laptops, workstations and on-prem servers and the cloud. Omniverse can be used by individuals for free and by enterprise teams via software subscriptions. At CES, we made the free version of Omniverse for individual's general availability. Omniverse allows creators with RTX GPUs to connect leading 3D design applications to a single scheme and superset their work with AI and physics. We also announced early access to Omniverse Cloud, which adds one-click capability to collaborate with other artists, whether across the room or across the globe. For digital twin applications, we announced the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robot platform using Omniverse and securely orchestrated and cloud delivered with the platform optimizes operational efficiency and accelerate deployment from logistics remods. It consists of several NVIDIA AI technologies and SDKs, including data for high-precision mapping, metropolis or situational awareness and reop for real-time route optimization. Moving to automotive. Q4 revenue was $125 million, declined 7% sequentially and 14% from the year ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our Orion-based product platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1 with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year and momentum building into calendar 2023 [indiscernible] I will now hand it over to Jensen to provide more color on this morning's automotive news. Thanks, Colette. Earlier today, we announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver fleets of software-defined cars. Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will have next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled software and services built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. DRIVE Orin will be the AI computer brain running our DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software. And the DRIVE Hyperion sensor network will be the central nervous system. This new vehicle architecture will enable a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving and parking systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring and advanced visualization of the vehicles surroundings. We are very much looking forward to partnering with Thierry Bolloré, JLR's CEO, and his team to reinvent the future of luxury cars. Our full stack end-to-end approach is a new business model that offers downloadable AV and AI services to the fleet of JLR vehicles with a shared software revenue stream for both companies over the life of the fleet. This partnership follows the template of our announcement with Mercedes-Benz. Our shared software revenue opportunity with both OEMs will scale with the size of their NVIDIA-powered fleet, which, combined, can exceed 10 million cars over a decade. Colette, back to you. Thanks, Jensen. Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.3 billion grew 11% sequentially and 71% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $10.6 billion was up 58%. Data center growth in the quarter was once again led by our compute products on strong demand for NVIDIA AI. Hyperscale and cloud demand was outstanding, with revenue more than doubling year-on-year. Vertical Industries also posted strong double-digit year-on-year growth led by consumer Internet companies. The flagship NVIDIA A100 GPU continue to drive strong growth. Inference-focused revenue more than tripled year-on-year. Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton and France server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production. Data center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere architecture-based product for fast-growing AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep learning recommendation systems as well as cloud executing. For example, Block Inc., a global leader in payment, uses conversational AI in its Square Assistant to schedule appointments with customers. These AI models are trained on video GPUs in AWS and perform inference 10x faster on the AWS GP service and on our CPUs. Social media company Snap used NVIDIA GPUs and Merlin deep recommendator software to improve inference cost efficiency by 50% and decrease latency to 2x. For the third year in a row, industry benchmarks show that NVIDIA AI continues to lead the industry in performance. Along with partners like Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA such records in the latest benchmarks for AI training across 8 popular AI workloads, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and detection. NVIDIA AI was the only platform to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility as well as our performance. The numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just 2 months, thanks to continuous innovations across the full stack in AI algorithms, optimization tools and system software. Over the past 3 years, they saw performance gains of over 20x powered by advances we have made across our full stack offering GPUs, networks, systems and software. The leading performance of NVIDIA AI is sought after by some of the world's most technically advanced companies. Meta Platforms unveils its new AI supercomputer research, SuperCluster, with over 6,000 A100 GPUs moved to an NVIDIA -- Meta's early benchmarks showed its system can train large natural language processing models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system. In a second phase later this year, the system will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver 5x of mixed precision AI performance. In addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy and flexibility to handle a wide range of AI models as its key criteria for the system. We continue to broaden the reach and ease the adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries. Our ecosystem of NVIDIA-certified systems expanded with Cisco and Hitachi -- which joined Dell, HewlettPackard Enterprise, Insper, Lenovo and Supermicro, among other sever manufacturers. We released version 1.1 of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, allowing enterprises to accelerated annual workloads on VMware, on mainstream IT infrastructure as well. And we expanded the number of system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Forrester Research in its evaluation of Enterprise AI infrastructure providers recognized NVIDIA in the top category of leaders. An example of a partner that's helping to expand our reach into enterprise IT is Deloitte, a leading global consulting firm, which has built its center for AI computing on NVIDIA DGX Superpod. At CES, we extended our collaboration to AV development, leveraging our own robust AI infrastructure and Deloitte's team of 5,500 system integration developers and 2,000 data scientists to architect solutions for truly intelligent transportation. Our networking products posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, driven by exceptional demand across use cases ranging from computing, supercomputing and enterprise to storage. adopters-led growth driven by adoption of our next-generation products and higher-speed deployments. While revenue was gated by supply, we anticipate improving capacity in coming quarters, which should allow us to serve with significant customer demands we're seeing. Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industry seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA. Now let me turn it back over to Jensen for some comments on Arm. Thanks, Colette. Last week, we terminated our efforts to purchase Arm. When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believe that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide. We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before. Our focus is accelerated computing. We are on track to launch our Arm-based CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our 3-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs and DPUs. Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job. And together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time. Back to you, Colette. Thanks, Jensen. We're going to turn to our P&L and our outlook. For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Investor Relations lean. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect sequential growth to be driven primarily by Data Center. Gaming will also contribute to growth. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the Arm write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.6 billion. For the fiscal year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses at a similar percent as in fiscal 2022. GAAP and non-GAAP other operating, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. Non-GAAP tax rate are expected to be 11% and 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in person on March 7. We will also be hosting a virtual Investor Day on March 22, alongside the GPU Technology Conference. This will follow Jensen's opening keynote, which we invite you to tune into. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 27. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs & Company. Great. Jensen and Colette, I wanted to ask about Data Center. Colette, based on your guidance, you're probably guiding Data Center growth on a year-over-year basis to accelerate into the April quarter. You talked about hyperscale cloud growing more than 2x and enterprise verticals growing strong double digits in the January quarter. Can you kind of speak to the drivers for April and perhaps speak to visibility into the second half of the fiscal year as well in Data Center? I'll start, and I'll turn it over to Jensen. For Q1, our guidance can include an acceleration of Data Center from where we left in terms of Q4. We will have growth across several of our market platforms within Q1, both Data Center, Gaming and probably a couple of others. But yes, there is expected to be accelerated growth as we move into Q1. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk about the drivers that we see for the quarter and also for the full year. Yes. We have several -- first of all, Toshiya, great to hear from you. We have several growth drivers in data centers. There's hyperscale, public cloud, enterprise core and enterprise edge. We're seeing growth across the entire spectrum. There are several different use cases that are particularly exciting, large language models -- language, understanding models triggered by the invention of transformers, which is probably one of the most important AI models that's been invented in some time. And conversational AI used for customer service, chat bots, a whole bunch of customer service applications. It can be web-based. It could be point-of-sale base. It could be cloud-based. Recommender systems, deep learning-based recommender systems are making groundbreaking improvements. And cloud graphics, all of the work that we're doing and putting rendering or putting simulations up in the cloud, cloud gaming, Android cloud gaming, are really driving adoption in the cloud. And so many different use cases across all of the different platforms in data centers. Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess another question on the data center side. Curious if you can speak to supply constraints on the wafer side and whether that played a role in terms of capping revenues in the January quarter and how you see that becoming less of a headwind for you as you proceed through the year. Thanks, C.J., for the question. I'll start on the data center supply. As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the Data Center business has been supply constrained. We're improving every single day. And we do expect to improve supply each quarter as we enter into fiscal year '23 here. So that is probably the key area within our Data Center. But from time to time, there can be other focused on do -- so I'll turn the rest of the question to Jensen in terms of how about the rest of the year as well. Yes. Catch it well. We are supply constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. As you know, our data center product line consists of GPUs and mix, Bluefield DPUs, Quantum and spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GP board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. And so we have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale, to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry standard servers, community servers for enterprise use and supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and quantum switches. And so the application space is quite broad. We saw demand constrained pretty much across the entire range. Our operations team did a fantastic job this year, both in executing in all of these complicated products, but also in expanding our supply base. We expect supply to improve each and every quarter going forward. And this quarter, this coming quarter, the Q1 -- the April quarter is, based on guidance that Colette just made, is consistent with an increasing supply base. We expect to still be demand constrained, but our supply base is going to increase this quarter, this next quarter and pretty substantially in the second half. Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Grace now that the strategy kind of separated from the acquisition of Arm. The -- what are your aspirations there? Is it going to be primarily oriented to the DGX and HX Systems business versus merchant chips? Just how are you thinking about that opportunity long term? Yes. Thanks, Joe. We have a multiple-arm projects ongoing in the company from connected -- for devices to robotics processors such as the new Orin that's going into autonomous vehicles and robotic systems and industrial automation, robotics and such. Orin is doing incredibly well. It started production. And as we mentioned earlier, it's going to drive an inflection point starting in Q2, but accelerating through Q3 and the several years after as we ramp into all of the electric cars and all of the robotic applications and robotaxis and such. We also have Arm projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of developments around the Arm architecture. One of the things that's really evolved nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. And it's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. And so you're going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us. And Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. But our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs. If it's an x86 from any vendor. So long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics and such. And so we love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications, and we intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs. Next, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Just on the inventory purchase obligations, I think this was the fourth quarter in a row where you've seen greater than 30% sequential growth and is the first quarter where that number is now eclipsing kind of your quarterly revenue guidance. And so I guess I'm trying to figure out to what extent is this just a reflection of how tight things are across the semi industry? To what extent is this the poker tale of kind of how bullish you are on future demand? And relative to your commentary, that supply starts to get better throughout the year, should we expect that number to start to level off? Or as the mix moves more to data center and more to longer cycle times, more complicated devices should that number continue to grow? The factors, the drivers that you mentioned in the supply chain, we expanded our supply chain footprint significantly this year to prepare us for both increased supply base and supply availability in each one of the quarters going forward, but also in preparation for some really exciting product launches. As mentioned, Orin ramping into autonomous vehicles is brand new. This is the inflection point of us growing into autonomous vehicles. This is going to be a very large business for us going forward. It was already mentioned, Grace is a brand-new product that has never been on NVIDIA's road map. And we already see great success with customers who love the architecture of it and desperately in need of the type of capability that Grace brings. And this should be a pretty exciting year for new product launches. And so we're preparing for all of that laying the foundation for us to bring all those exciting products to the marketplace. Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS. Obviously, there's a lot more talk from you about software. And I think it's still kind of a little bit of a black box for live investors. And I know, Jensen, that you've talked about software as a medium to basically open up new markets. But I'm wondering maybe if you can sort of quantify how big the software licensing revenue is today and maybe when you might start to break it out like you did data center, which really got the stock moving in a huge, huge way. Yes. NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system to the system software, the acceleration engines and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse. These are applications that sit on top of system software and are really valuable to the marketplace. The way to think about our software licensing -- so we've always been a software-driven business. But for the very first time, we have packaged licensable software on -- available to customers. The way that we license software for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is per node of server. There's some 20 million, 25 million servers that are installed in the world today in enterprises, not including clouds. We believe that every single server in the future will be running AI software. And we would like to offer an engine that enables enterprises to be able to use the most advanced the most trusted, the most utilized AI engine in the world. And so that is essentially the target market, if you will, for NVIDIA AI. The NVIDIA Omniverse is targeting -- is designed for creators contributing content to a virtual world and connect it to robots that are contributing to content in a virtual world. And so it's based on connections. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. And those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. And those are -- so the Omniverse business model is per connection per year. And in the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver, if it's AB software or parking software or cabin-based AI software, whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics of that. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. But basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. And so you could imagine, with 10 million cars, with a modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. And so our business opportunity is based on those factors. But our software business really, really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse and DRIVE. And so I watch the spot, I think this is going to be a very significant business opportunity for us, and we look forward to reporting on it. Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Jensen, in the past, you mentioned about 10% or so adoption rate for AI among your customer base. I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve that you tend to differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers? And then kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also? Yes. The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. But whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection, in cases of consumer pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI, where people are calling chat bots. But in the future, every website will have a chat bot, every phone number will have a chat bot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, we'll have a chat bot. And so customer service will be heavily, heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's a fast food or a quick service, businesses are going to have chat bots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents. And so all of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs, computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service. The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about an AI much, much more so than a recording, which obviously is not intelligent and therefore it's difficult to, if you will, call your manager or call somebody to provide services that they can't. And so the number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. I think we're -- we remain early days in our adoption. It's incredible how fast it has grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. It pretty much says that almost all future software will be written with AI or by AI. And when it's done, it will be an AI. And we see it in all these different industries. And so I'm pretty certain we're in the early innings yet of AI, and this is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known. With respect to capital, we -- as you know, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process, and we'll go through that, and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth and sustaining our growth and accelerating our growth, and we'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings. We're just delighted to have so much capital. And so just to put it out there. And next, we'll go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Can you guys talk about how the launch of the RTX 3050 is going so far? And maybe more broadly, your view of where we are in the product cycle on gaming? Thanks, Michael. Let's see. We -- RTX is an unqualified home run. RTX completely reinvented modern computer graphics. It made -- it brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our processors, but also engage the powerful Tensor for processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. And if not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and of course, cameras and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. And so RTX was a game changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics. And it was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform from Omniverse. We're about, I think, about 1/3 of the way through upgrading an installed base that is growing. You know that video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. And Steam over the last 2 years has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. And in just the last couple of years, a brand-new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred million dollar business. I think it's close to $1 billion that they're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it. And so the overall gaming market is growing and it's growing quite nicely. But the thing that, in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire installed base, the growing of our installed base because gaming is growing. There are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. And we now are seeing across the board people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home. In addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is really, really doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. So 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. In live video broadcast video, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. And so 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content, it's actually used now for all forms of digital content creation. And so RTX has all of these different drivers working behind it, and we're definitely in the early innings of RTX. Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. So you said that the growth in the next quarter is about $450 million, give or take, driven by Data Center. Can you give us some feeling for how that growth is being driven by units versus pricing versus mix and how those drivers might differ between Gaming and Data Center, if at all, for Colette? It's really early in the quarter to determine, Stacy, our exact mix that we will have based on the unit and an ASP -- our overall growth quarter-over-quarter going into Q1 will be driven by data center primarily. We will see a little bit of growth there in gaming. I think that's important to understand that even after Q4 holiday moving into Q1, we'll still probably see growth in gaming, which is different in terms of what we've seen seasonally. We will probably have growth in automotive as well sequentially between Q4 and Q1. There are still some areas that are so constrained. We are working again to try and improve that for every quarter going forward, but that's how you should look at our earnings for Q1 primarily from Data Center. Next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Congratulations on the solid results and execution. The networking connectivity portfolio addition has been pretty solid for the NVIDIA team, especially in enabling scaling of your GPU systems, improving connectivity bottlenecks in yours and your customers' accelerated compute platforms. So in a year where spending is growing 30%. You've got a strong networking upgrade cycle, which is good for your NIC products and just continued overall good attach rates, if the team can unlock more supply, will the networking connectivity business grow in line or faster than the overall Data Center business this year? And then for Jensen, have you driven synergies between Mellanox's leadership in networking connectivity? And for example, leveraging their capabilities for your internally developed NVLink connectivity and switching architectures? Yes, absolutely. If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX and DGX Super Pine and the research supercomputer that was just installed in Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving some -- moving computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with Synchronoss and Precision Timing so that we could create Omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space time, these things are just simply not possible. The work that we're doing to bring cloud-native secure multi-tenancy to supercomputing wouldn't have been possible. The number of innovations, that are countless. And so I am so thrilled with the combination and so through what the work the Mellanox team are doing. We've accelerated road maps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design. BlueField's road map has been accelerated probably by about a year. The switch in -- the quantum switch and the spectrum switch, the SerDes are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet and InfiniBand and NVLink, absolutely the best servers in the world. And so the list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. And so I'm super thrilled with that. With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. And the reason for that -- the reason for that is twofold. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox, Mellanox is highly heavyweight in the upper end of networking, where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. And so it's sensible that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than the last-generation networking. And Mellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world class. The second reason is because the areas where the overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast, which related to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. And so those different applications are growing faster than the core. And so it would be sensible that we have the opportunity as we expand our supply base to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall. Our next question will come from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Yes. Jensen, I maybe wanted to expand on some of the things that you were just speaking about in your last answer with respect to the Data Center business. It's not often maybe ever that you have both x86 server vendors having new big platform upgrades in the same year, which will probably happen later this year. There's a lot going on there, PCIe, some CXL stuff. I wonder if you could talk a bit about your Data Center business broadly and what you feel might be memory and I/O constrained currently that these systems might unlock for you both in the cloud and enterprise side, but also in the DGX business. Yes. Thanks, Matt. The -- there are several bottlenecks, and let me just highlight some of them. One of the largest bottlenecks is memory speed. And memory speed, that's the reason why we use the fastest memories in the world, HBM and GDDR, et cetera, et cetera. We are the largest consumers of the fastest memories in the world and not even by -- there's not -- with no close second that I know. And so our consumption of fast memories is important to the work that we do. The second is networking performance. It is the reason why we have the fastest networks. It is also the reason why we have the most fastest networks in any system. We will have, for example, 8 InfiniBand at the highest speeds connected right into HGX or DGX server. And so the work that we do in GPU direct memory, RDMA, the work that we do with GPU direct storage, the work that we do with in-network computing and all reductions and moving data around inside the network is absolutely world-class. This is an area that we are just -- I am just incredibly proud. All of that is so that we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is on CPU and 8 GPUs. And the fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. This year, we expect a transition in PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that. And that's something that we're very good at. And we'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years. And all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world, and we'll take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. But we have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there. Our final question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Co. Yes. Congrats on the good quarter and guide. Colette, question on the gross margin and to Jensen's point about really creating a software business driven by Omniverse, DRIVE and Enterprise. When you're kind of contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your kind of more of a longer-term margin profile. Yes. Thanks for the question on gross margin and the long term. When we think about the long-term gross margin, we have incorporated software in many of our platforms even today, meaning our high-value platforms in data center or [indiscernible] of our business have really helped us with our gross margins to this point, and we've done a really solid job of managing that and the growth over the years. I believe these businesses will continue to be a growing opportunity for us, but now also with the ability to package up -- So as that scales with our Enterprise customers, in the Data center and with our already procured deals, a lot of work we've got a great opportunity in the future and [indiscernible] margin -- so we're going to work on that. We've set the stage for having been able to package it up to be able to sell it separately to create the business model, to create the partners that are helping us sell it. But yes, we do believe this will be a driver in the long term. Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics and some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform optimized across the full stack, architecture for data center scale is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of the NVIDIA operations team as we make substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. And this year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. NVIDIA DRIVE is a full stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping and the autonomous driving application service. Our data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics robotaxis, shuttles and trucks. EV companies have selected our Orin chip across the world. And our partnership with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover has opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet. NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. Today's Internet is 2D and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of Internet will be 3D and AI will be connected to the physical world. We created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse. We can't wait to share more of our progress at next month's GTC, learn about new chips, new computing platforms, new AI and robotic breakthroughs and the new frontiers of Omniverse. Hear from the technologists of Deloitte, Epic Games, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Pfizer, Sony, Visa, Walt Disney, Zoom and more. This GTC promises to be our most exciting developers conference ever. We had quite a year, yet nothing makes me more proud than the incredible people who have made NVIDIA one of the best companies to work for and the company where they do their lives' work. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. We delivered a strong quarter driven by record revenue in both Data Center and Gaming with strong fundamentals and execution against a challenging macro backdrop.
Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. Data Center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward.
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year-on-year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years according to Newzoo. And NVIDIA RTX has set new standard for the industry with demand from both first-time GPU buyers as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, double from last year.
We estimate that almost a-third of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world, and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid though mixed by region, and demand in America's remained strong.
However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2.
Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision. The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward.
Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year.
Driving this growth are not just gamers, but also the fast-growing category of content creators from whom we offer dedicated NVIDIA studio drivers. We've also developed applications and tools to empower artists from Omniverse for advanced 3D and collaboration to broadcast for live streaming to canvas for painting landscapes with AI.
The creator economy is estimated at $100 billion and powered by 80 million individual creators and broadcasters. We continued to build out our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.
Gamers can now access RTX 3080 class streaming, our new top-tier offering with subscription plans of $19.99 a month. We added over 100 games to the GeForce NOW library, bringing the total to over 1,300 games.
And last week, we launched Fortnite on GeForce NOW with touch controls for mobile devices, streaming through the Safari web browser on iOS and the GeForce NOW Android app.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Q1 revenue was $622 million was down sequentially 3% and up 67% from a year ago. Demand remains strong as enterprises continued to build out their employee's remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work. Sequential growth in the mobile workstation GPUs was offset by lower desktop revenue.
Strong year-on-year growth was supported by the NVIDIA RTX Ampere architecture product cycle. Top use cases include digital content creation at customers such as Sony Pictures Animation and medical imaging at customers such as Medtronic.
In just its second quarter of general availability, our Omniverse enterprise software is being adopted by some of the world's largest companies. Amazon is using Omniverse to better optimize warehouse design and flow and to train more intelligent robots.
Kroger is using Omniverse to optimize store efficiency with digital twin store simulation. And PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the supply chain.
Omniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand with third-party developers in the robotics, industrial automation, 3D design and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse.
Moving to automotive. Q1 revenue of $138 million, increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year ago quarter. Our DRIVE O-RAN SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. O-RAN has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers and robotaxi companies. In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker and Lucid an award winning EV pioneer were the latest to announce that they are building their next-generation fleets on DRIVE O-RAN. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $11 billion over the next six years, up from $8 billion just a year ago.
Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.8 billion grew 15% sequentially and accelerated to 83% growth year-on-year. Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year-on-year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads. Customers remain supply constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand.
Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include; consumer Internet companies, financial services and telecom. Overall, Data Center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries.
Top workloads includes; recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models and cloud graphics. Networking revenue accelerated on strong broad-based demand for our next-generation 25, 50 and 100-gig ethernet adapters. Customers are choosing NVIDIA's networking products for their leading performance and robust software functionality.
In addition, networking revenue is benefiting from growing demand for DGX super pods and cross-selling opportunities. Customers are increasingly combining our compute and networking products to build what are essentially modern AI factories with data as the raw material input and intelligence as the output. Our networking products are still supply constrained though we expect continued improvement throughout the rest of the year.
One of the biggest workloads driving adoption of NVIDIA AI is natural language processing, which has been revolutionized by transformer based models. Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include; large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron BERT for drug discovery and DeepMind AlphaFold for a protein structure prediction.
Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for TAF such as text generation, translation, summarization and answering questions. To do that, Transformers use enormous training data sets and very large networks well into the hundreds of billions of parameters. To run these giant models without sacrificing low inference times, customers like Microsoft are increasingly deploying NVIDIA AI, including our NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and full software stack.
In addition, we are seeing a rising wave of customer innovation using large language models that is driven by increased demand for NVIDIA AI and GPU instances in the cloud. At GTC, we announced our next-generation Data Center GPU, the H100 based on the new or upper architecture. Packed with 80 billion transistors, H100 is the world's largest, most powerful accelerator, offering an order of magnitude leap in performance over the A100. We believe H100 is hitting the market at the perfect time. H100 is ideal for advancing large language models and deep recommender systems the two largest scale AI workloads today
We are working with leading server makers and hyperscale customers to qualify and ramp H100. As well as the new DGX H100 AI supercomputing system will ramp in volume late in the calendar year. Building on the H100 product side, we are on track to launch our first ever Data Center CPU, Grace, in the first half of 2023. Grace is the ideal CPU for AI factories. This week at COMPUTEX, we announced that dozens of server models based on Grace will be brought to market by the first wave of system builders, including ASUS, Foxconn, Gigabyte, QCT, Supermicro and Wiwynn. These servers will be powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Super Chip, which features two CPUs and the Grace Upper Super Chip, which pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated model.
We've introduced new reference designs based on Grace for the massive new workloads of next-generation data centers. CGX for cloud graphics and gaming, OVX for digital twins or Omniverse and HGX for HPC and AI. These server designs are all optimized for NVIDIA's rich accelerated computing software stacks and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA certified systems lineup.
The enabler for the Grace Hopper and Grace Super Chips is our ultra energy-efficient, low-latency, high-speed memory coherent interconnect NVLink, which scales from die to die, chip to chip and system to system. With NVLink, we can configure Grace and Hopper to address a broad range of workloads.
Future NVIDIA chips, the CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace Hopper based on our world-class SERDES technology. We're making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms.
In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum-4, the world's first 400-gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum-4 Switch, ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, Bluefield-3 DPU and the DOCA software. Built for AI and video Spectrum 4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security and powerful features to enable high-performance advanced virtualization and simulation at scale. Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU and SOC quarters over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support the customer demand.
Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was up 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago, and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures. We expect to maintain gross margins at current levels in Q2.
Going forward, as new products ramp and software becomes a larger percent of revenue, we have opportunities to increase gross margins longer term. GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, impacted by a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the ARM transaction.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.7%. We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year and are now slowing to integrate these new employees.
This also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persist. We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20s range this year. we expect sequential increases to level off after Q2 as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not reoccur in the second half.
During Q1, we repurchased $2 billion of our stock. Our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase an additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023.
Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our outlook assumes an estimated impact of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and China COVID lockdowns. We estimate the impact of lower sell-through in Russia and China to affect our Q2 Gaming sell-in by $400 million.
Furthermore, we estimate the absence of sales to Russia to have a $100 million impact on Q2 in Data Center. We expect strong sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive to be more than an offset by the sequential decline in Gaming. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the BofA Securities Technology Conference in person on June 7, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 24.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you please poll for questions? Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess would love to get an update on how you're thinking about the Gaming cycle from here. The business has essentially doubled over the last two years. And now we've got some crosswinds with crypto falling off, channel potentially clearing ahead of a new product cycle. You talked about macro challenges. But at the same time, only a third of the installed base has RTX and we're moving out from under supply. So we'd love to hear your thoughts from here once we get beyond kind of the challenges around COVID lockdown in the July quarter? How are you thinking about Gaming trends? Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. The -- you captured a lot of the dynamics well in your question. The underlying dynamics of the Gaming industry is really solid, net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia. The rest of the market is fairly robust and we expect the Gaming dynamics to be intact.
The several things that are driving the Gaming the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast. So, many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio. Because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days. The need for GeForce PCs have never been greater. And so I think the fundamental dynamics are really good. And so as we look into the second half of the year, we look -- it's hard to predict exactly what -- when COVID and the war in Russia is going to be behind us. But nonetheless, the governing dynamics of the Gaming industry is great. Next, we'll go to Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Good morning. Jensun, I wanted to ask a bit of a question on the Data Center business. In this upcoming cycle with H-100, there's some I/O upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there.
I wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically, or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry sort of responding to that potential move? Thanks. Yes. I appreciate the question. The -- let's see, the first point that you made is a very big point. The next generation of servers that are being teed up right now are all Gen 5. The I/O performance is substantially higher than what was available before.
And so, you're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that. Brand-new networking cards from our company and others. Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh. And so, we're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper.
There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge.
Each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture. So there isn't one size that fits all, which is one of the reasons why it's so terrific that we support PCI Express that we innovated chip-to-chip interconnect for diverse -- before anybody else did, this is now some seven years ago, we're in our fourth generation of NVLink that allows us to connect two chips next to each other, two dies, two chips, two modules, two SXM modules to two systems to multiple systems.
And so our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink has made it possible for us to mix and match chips, dies, packages, systems and all of these different types of configurations. And I think that, over time, you're going to see even more types of configurations.
And the reason for that has to do with a couple of very important new type of data centers that are emerging. And you're starting to see that now with fairly large installations, infrastructures with NVIDIA, HPC and NVIDIA AI.
These are really AI factories where you're processing the data, refining the data and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload and they're running at 24/7.
Deep recommender systems is a good example of that. In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves. That would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications.
And then on the other end, you're seeing data centers at the edge that are going to be robotics or autonomous data centers that are running 24/7. They are going to be running in factories and retail stores and warehouses, logistics warehouses, all over the world. So these two new types of data centers are just emerging, and they also have different architectures. So I think the net of it all is that our ability to support every single workload because we have a universal accelerator, running every single workload from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing to training to inference that we can support Arm and x86 that we support PCI Express to Multisystem NVlink to multi-chip NVLink to multi-die NVLink, that capability for us is -- makes it possible for us to really be able to serve all of these different segments.
With respect to vertical integration, I think that system integration, the better way to make me saying that is that system integration is going to come in all kinds of different ways. We're going to do semi-custom chips as we've done with many companies in the past, including Nintendo. We'll do semi-custom chiplets as we do with NVLink. NVLink is open to our partners. And they could bring it to any fab and connect it coherently into our chip. We could do multi module packages. We could do multi-package systems. So there's a lot of different ways to do system integration. Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the sequential. So Colette, I know you said the $500 million was a $400 million hit to Gaming and a $100 million hit to data. So I'm assuming that -- that doesn't mean the Gaming is down $400 million. I mean it's Gaming -- do you see Gaming actually down more than the actual Russia and lockdown hit. And I guess just how do I think about the relative sequentials of the businesses in light of those constraints that you guys are facing? Sure. Let me start first with what does that mean to Gaming. What does that mean to Gaming for Q2? We do expect Gaming to decline into Q2. We still believe our end demand remains very strong. Ampere has just been a great architecture, and there's many areas where we continue to see strength and growth in both our sell-through and probably what we will see added into that channel as well. But in total, Q2 Gaming will decline from last quarter from Q1 that it will probably decline in the teens. As we try and work through some of these lockdowns in China, which are holding us up. So overall, the demand for Gaming is still strong. We still expect end demand to grow year-over-year in Q2. Next, we'll go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. If you listen to the networking OEMs, this earnings season, it seems that there was a lot of talk about increased spending by enterprises on their data centers and sometimes you hear them talking about how this is being driven by AI. You talked about your year-over-year growth in your cloud versus enterprise spending. I wonder if you could talk about what you were seeing sequentially? Are you seeing a sequential inflection in the enterprise? And can you talk about the attach rate of software for enterprise versus data centers. And, which software is -- are you seeing the most interest? I know you talked about, is it Omniverse? Is it natural language processing, or is there one big driver, or is it a bunch of drivers for the various different software packages you have? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. We had a record Data Center business this last quarter. We expect to have a record, another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half. AI and data-driven machine learning techniques for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in the final analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence.
We want to produce intelligence. And there are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly. And so I think the trend that you hear other people are experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data driven insights, artificial intelligence. However, it's described, it's all exactly the same thing. And it's sweeping just about every industry and every company.
Our networking business is also highly supply constrained. Our demand is really, really high. And it requires a lot of components aside from just our chips. Components and transceivers and connectors and cables. And just -- it's a really -- it's a complicated system, the network, and there are many physical components. And so the supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best and our supply has been increasing from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2 and increase in Q3 and Q4. And so we're really, really grateful for the support from the component industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that.
With respect to software, there are two, well, first of all, there are all kinds of machine learning models, computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, all kinds of robotics applications, the most -- probably the largest, the most visible one is self-driving cars, which is essentially a robotic AI. And then recently, this incredible breakthrough from an AI model called Transformers that has led to really, really significant advances in natural language understanding.
And so they're all these different types of models. There are thousands and thousands of species of AI models and used in all these different industries. One of my favorite, I'll just say it very quickly and I'll answer that question about the software. One of my favorites is using Transformers to understand the language of chemistry or using transformers and using AI models to understand the language of proteins, amino acids, which is genomics.
To apply AI to understand -- to recognize the patterns, to understand the sequence and essentially understand the language of chemistry and biology is a really, really important breakthrough. And all of this excitement around synthetic biology, much of it stands back to the – some of these inventions.
But anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. And that engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. But for enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architecture, support old architectures in their installed base, etcetera, and all the different use cases that they have. And so that engine is called NVIDIA AI.
It's almost like a sequel engine, if you will. And except this is an engine for artificial intelligence. There's another engine that we provide and that engine is called Omniverse and it's designed for the next wave of AI, where artificial intelligence has to not just manipulate information like recommender systems and conversational systems and such. But it has to interact with physical systems.
Whether it's interacting with physics directly, meaning robotics or being able to automate physical systems like heat recovery steam generators, which is really important today. And so Omniverse is designed to be able to sit at that interface, that intersection between simulation and artificial intelligence, and that's what Omniverse is about.
Omniverse has now – let’s see some -- we're still early in the deployment of Omniverse for commercial license. It's been a couple of quarters now since we've released Omniverse enterprise. And I think, at this point, we have 10% of the world's top 100 companies that are already customers, licensing customers, substantially more who we're evaluating. I think it's been downloaded nearly 200,000 times. It has been tried in some 700 companies.
And Colette highlighted some of the companies, you might see some of the companies that are using it in all kinds of interesting applications at GTC. And so, I fully expect that the NVIDIA AI engine, the Omniverse engine, are going to be very successful for us in the future and contribute greatly to our earnings. Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if your Q2 outlook includes any destocking benefits from the new products that you're planning to launch this year? And then my question is gentleman for you. You're still guiding Data Center to a very strong, I think, close to 70% or so year-on-year growth, despite all the headwinds. Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macro economy? I like is there any cyclical impact on Data Center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year? Yes. Vivek, let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discussed about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year. So, you should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. I'll turn it over for Jensen Huang for the rest. Thanks. Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, has grown significantly. It's doubled year-over-year. and we're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. And this is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Core GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator.
And so you could use it for data processing for ETL, for example, extract, transform and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many sequel functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs. We accelerate Rapids, we accelerate which is the Python version a Data Center scale version of Pandas, we accelerate Spark 3.0. And so from database queries to data processing, to extraction, and transform and loading of data before you do training and inference and whatever image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100.
And so we're seeing great success there. on at the core and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. You probably have heard about Deep Recommender Systems. This is the economic engine, the information filtering engine of the Internet, if not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our Internet experience shopping experience with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day constantly and be able to use your three-inch phone to even engage the Internet.
And so all of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing call a recommender system second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chat bots and website customer service, even live customer service being now supported by AI, conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service on the one hand.
On the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage. And then the third is this groundbreaking piece of work as related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough. But within it, is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained and so much data. And we recently announced Megatron 530B. And it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of – I think they call it Turing.
And this language model and others like it, like open AI, GPD 3 are really transformative and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trade model that is really quite remarkable.
Now we're working with thousands of start-ups, large companies that are building who are using the public cloud. And so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud. I think we have now 10,000 AI inception startups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI, whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money, because the computation time is significantly reduced. The quality of service is a lot better and they could do greater things. And so that's driving AI in the cloud. And so all of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI. The thousands of companies around the world that are using NVIDIA AI in the cloud -- driving public cloud demand, all of these things are driving our Data Center growth. And so we expect to see Data Center demand remain strong. Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Thank you very much. I had a question about this $500 million impact for July and whether it's more supply related or demand related. And that's because most others in semis are sort of setting this China stuff, in particular, is more of a logistics issues, so more of a supply issues, but the language Colette you were using in your commentary side of lower sell-through in gaming and sort the absence of sales in Russia, to me that sounds a little more demand which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have.
So, I ask because if it's supply related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing. But if demand related that might never come back and it to be the beginning of a falling night. So, I wonder if you can sort of walk through that for me? Thanks. Thanks, Tim, for the question. Let me try and bet here on the China and Russia, two very different things. The current China lockdowns that we are seeing interestingly has implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in out of the country. It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure.
From a demand perspective, it has also been head from the gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown, focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. So, it's impacting our demand.
We do believe that they will come out of COVID and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply will sort it out. It's very difficult to determine how.
Now, in the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter. But there were plans and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue of probably about 2% of our company revenue historically and a little larger percentage when you look at our Gaming business. I hope that helped. Next, we'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you very much Colette and Jensen. I actually really appreciate it that you called out demand from those two companies, it feels like it's healthy to say demand is a problem, so refreshing to hear that.
I had a question on the second half and it relates to both Data Center as well as Gaming. So, last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the Data Center has never been better. So, I was wondering if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true, all the orders that you have been getting there intact and you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just want to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays?
And then on Gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year-over-year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3. Thank you. Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of Data Centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. And the reason for that is several. One, if you recall a couple two, three years ago, deep learning and AI was starting to accelerate in the most computer science deep companies in the world with CSPs and hyperscalers. And -- but just about everywhere else, it was still quite nascent. And there was a couple of reasons for that.
Obviously, the understanding of the technology is not as pervasive at the time. The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. And then now with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly or, quite frankly, oftentimes impossible.
And so now, the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence at a fairly effective way and in many industries rather transformative. And so I think, number one, we went from clouds and hyperscalers to all of industries.
Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out the inference is by far the harder. And the reason for that is because there are so many different models and there are so many different use cases and so many quality of service requirements, and you want to run these inference models in a small of a footprint as you can.
And so when you scale out, the number of users that use the service is really quite high. So using acceleration, using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech to chemistry to biology, you name it. And we do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low. And so the more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. And that, I think, that wisdom is absolutely true. And so the second dimension is training to inference.
The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud to on-prem to edge. And then the final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to in just about every industry, find growth. And so as you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical part, vertical industries, which is financial services and retail and telco and all of those vertical industries have also grown very, very nicely. And so, in all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better. And then starting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems. And so, our networking business is growing very, very nicely as well. Next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for let me ask the question. I just want to maybe just ask this question a little bit more directly. So, it's good to see the team being able to drive – navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You look strong sequential growth in data center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right? And so, as we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating.
You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. And in general, I think previously, you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year. I understand the uncertainty around gaming, but does the team expect continued sequential growth in data center through the remainder of the year? Either one of those answers -- the answer is yes. We see a strong demand in data center, hyperscale to cloud computing to vertical industries. Ampere is going to continue to scale out. It's been qualified in every single company in the world. And so, after two years, it remains the best universal accelerator on the planet, and it's going to continue to scale out in all these different domains and different markets.
We're going to layer on top of that, a brand-new architecture Hopper. We’re going to layer on top of that brand-new networking architectures. Quantum 3, CX-7, BlueField 3 and we have increasing supply. And so, we're looking forward to an excellent quarter next quarter again for data centers and going into the second half. Next, we'll go to Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open. Yes, thank you. Wonder if you could speak a little bit about the purchase obligations, which seemed like they were up again in the quarter. And how that – was that a function of longer-dated obligations or a higher magnitude of obligations? And maybe you could just speak to supply constraints in general. You've mentioned a couple of times in the call, about continued constraints in the networking business. What about the other parts of the business? Where are you still constrained? Yes. So let me start here, and I'll see if Jensen wants to add more of that. Our purchase obligations, as well as our prepaid have two major things to keep in mind. One, for the first time ever, we are prepaying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long term. And additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long lead time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have the products coming to market.
A good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our Data Center business, which you can imagine, are much larger systems, much more complex systems and those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand both in the upcoming quarters and further. Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply constrained are networking. Our demand is quite strong. We've been improving it each time. But yes, we still have demand -- excuse me, supply concerns with networking still. Is there others that you want to add on, Jensen? No, I thought you were perfect. That's perfect. Our final question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for fitting me in. And most of my questions around Gaming and Data Center have been answered. But I guess I'll ask about the Auto segment. While it's still small, clearly, you guys sound confident in that business starting to see ""significant sequential growth"" into this next quarter. I'm wondering if you could help us kind of think about the trajectory of that business over the next couple of quarters? And I think, in the past, you've said that, that should start to really inflect higher as we move into the second half of the year. Just curious if you could help us think about that piece of the business? Several data points. We are just starting. We have just started shipping O-RAN in the first quarter of shipping production O-RAN. O-RAN is a robotics processor. It's designed for a software-defined robotic car or robotic pick and placer or a robotic mover, logistics mover.
We've been designed into 35 car and trucks and robo taxi companies and more others, if you include logistics movers and last-mile delivery systems and farming equipment and the number of design wins for O-RAN is really quite fantastic.
O-RAN is a revolutionary processor. And it's designed as a, if you will, a Data Center on a chip. And it is the first Data Center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, it's safe, it has the ability to be rather resilient as confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. And so O-RAN is really a technological marvels in production. We experienced very likely the lowest auto quarter in some time for some time.
And the reason for that is because over the next six years-or-so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured estimated. And so I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that O-RAN and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multibillion dollar business. It's on its way surely there. The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major Data Center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area.
And O-RAN is just one example of our work here. We have four pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems. Starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it, to train robotics AIs; second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is omniverse; third, to the memory of the robotics AI otherwise known as mapping; and then finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system, and that's where O-RAN goes. But O-RAN is just one of our four pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI. And so I am really optimistic and really enthusiastic about the next phase of the computer industry's growth. And I think a lot of it is going to be at the edge. A lot of it's going to be about robotics. Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for any additional closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities remain unchanged. The effectiveness of deep learning AI continues to stand. The transformer model, which led to the natural language understanding breakthroughs is being advanced to learn patterns with great spatial, sequential and temporal complexity.
Researchers are creating transformer models that are revolutionizing applications from robotics to drug discovery. The effectiveness of deep learning AI is driving companies across industries to adopt NVIDIA for AI computing. We're focused on four major initiatives. First, ramping our next generation of AI infrastructure chips and platforms, Hopper GPU, BlueField DPU, NVLink, InfiniBand, Quantum InfiniBand, Spectrum Ethernet Networking. And all this to help customers build their AI factories and take advantage of new AI breakthroughs like transformers.
Second, ramping our system and software industry partners to launch Grace, our first CPU. Third, ramping O-RAN, our new robotics processor and nearly 40 customers building cars, robo taxis, trucks, delivery robots, logistics robots, farming robots to medical instruments. And fourth, with our software platforms, adding new value to our ecosystem with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse and expanding into new markets with new CUDA acceleration libraries. These initiatives will greatly advance AI. And while continuing to extend this most impactful technology of our time to scientists in every field and companies in every industry. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year-on-year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue. Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook.
Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China. The decline in Gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated, driven by both lower units and lower ASPs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand. We implemented programs with our Gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel and to price position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch.
As noted last quarter, we had expected cryptocurrency mining to make a diminishing contribution to gaming demand. We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong.
NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA’s GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam. Gaming has emerged from the pandemic an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity. Estimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce NOW registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350.
Moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed and OEMs worked to reduce inventory. We expect these trends to persist in Q3. While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads. We believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office as well as in the cloud.
In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial levers and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens Xcelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse. This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA to Siemens ecosystem of the world’s largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the Internet.
First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries. We also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112. And finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neural graphics, which intertwine AI and graphics to help automate their creation of virtual world.
Moving to Automotive. Revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year-ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpit and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume.
We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our automotive revenue as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum. During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners, NIO, Li Auto, JIDU and Human Horizons as well as Pony.ai’s line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE. Looking forward, we expect our $11 billion automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth.
Moving to Data Center. Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year-on-year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions. Vertical industries grew both, sequentially and year-on-year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet, data processing and training and cloud graphics.
Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100x larger recommender models by moving its inference from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs. Its ability to deploy a higher-quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images.
And Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training. From a product perspective, networking led growth this quarter with strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adopters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400 gigabit per second Ethernet networking platform.
Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPO. Top computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace, CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supers. 72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA’s armor Selene supercomputer ranks at number 8 in the top 500 and is the world’s fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA.
Significant advances in software technologies are key to our platform performance. In the past two years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6x more performance as measured by the MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations. Last month, we announced an update to the NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%, improving a multi-hundred million dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers.
LLM are one of the most important neural networks today, ranging in size from tens of billions to over 1 trillion parameters. Learning from text, they can be used for real-time content generation, tech summarization, customer service chat box and question answering for conversational AI interfaces. Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA DGX Foundry as well as in Microsoft Azure cloud with other platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during the time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty. We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact.
GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs, as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment, and engineering development of new products coming to market.
We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth while managing near-term profitability. Our full year non-GAAP OpEx is expected to grow over 30%. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases. We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023.
Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal ‘23. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in data center and automotive. Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million.
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Jefferies Conference in Chicago on August 30th and the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on September 12th. And we will be holding a financial analyst Q&A with management following Jensen’s GTC keynote on September 20th. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 16th.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist? Would you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I think the question we all have is what is normalized revenues for gaming for you guys? Obviously, this is a challenge to you as well. But curious how you’re thinking about it today. Is the fiscal ‘20 recovery post the first half ‘19 correction an appropriate framework, or was that inflated by crypto as well? And I guess, as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? And is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if gaming does not meet your new updated outlook? Thanks so much. Well, let me start first there and see if I can assist in terms of how to think about after we get through our completion just now of Q2 and what we have provided here for guidance for Q3. Across those two quarters, the Q2 of ‘23, the Q3 of ‘23, we have likely undershipped gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion.
Now, on top of this, keep in mind that we do have gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new gaming product introductions that are around the corner as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology to just name a couple. I’ll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that.
Now, regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we need for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products. And so, this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So, our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are.
I’ll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more. Yes. Thanks, Colette. C.J., our sell-through is off the highs in the beginning of the year, but it’s still very solid. In fact, sell-through is -- has increased 70% since pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And so, it’s very clear that gaming is -- the fundamentals of gaming are strong, and this medium is really doing well. Not to mention the gaming platforms are being used -- our gaming PCs are being used for influencers, people sharing content, creating content, V bloggers, VTuber, there’s all kinds of new ways of engaging and spending time with video games.
Our strategy is to reduce the sell-in -- reduce the sell-in this quarter, next quarter to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we’re off the highs, and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so, our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We’ve also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products.
Ampere is the most popular GPU we’ve ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it’s going to be layered on top of that. And so, we’ve taken -- we’ve done two things. We’ve reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct and we’ve implemented programs with our partners to price position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation.
All of this we anticipate were working towards a path to being in a good shape going into next year. Oka? So, that’s what our game plan is. Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Actually, I just wanted to clarify, Jensen. So, should we assume that a gaming sell-in will kind of stay at these levels into your Q1 or Q2, or depending on new product launch, it might recover? So just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there.
And then, my question is actually similar on the data center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that data center CapEx could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors. I’m curious, what’s your sense of utilization of your data center shipments? And what is the risk that there could be a correction in the data center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers? Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through -- the sell-through, as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end market gaming demand is solid. It’s off the highs, which was really high recently in the beginning of the year. And so, we have -- and because we were building for such a vibrant market, we found ourselves with excess inventory. And so, our strategy is to sell well below -- sell in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct. We’ll do that for a couple of quarters or so. We believe that by the end of the year, we’ll be in a good shape going into next year. And so, I hope that answers your question. But, the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID. And so, the gaming market is really quite vibrant.
On the second question, on data center end markets, we hear fairly broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud. We hear quite broadly that demand for GPU rentals far exceeds current supply. And it’s fairly sensible to us, partly because the number of use cases for GPUs in the cloud has grown quite a bit. If you look at one particular segment in just managing -- collecting data and managing the data of the AV fleet and using that data to train AI models, using that data to reconstruct HD maps, the usage of GPUs in the cloud for just that one application has grown a lot. And furthermore, there’s the deep learning-based recommender systems has demonstrated such significant effectiveness. And it helps internet service providers to enhance engagement, enhance click-through rate. And so that -- so this particular form of recommender systems is going to really drive a fair amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud.
And then, of course, over the last several years, a very important model has emerged called transformers. You and I’ve spoken about this model several times in the past. And it’s been found that this transformer model, this large language -- this language model, which when scaled up in size, exhibits really spectacular and effective capabilities for -- to be used to learn skills with either few shots or almost no shot, meaning it could learn skills, it could perform skills that it has never learned because the knowledge was somehow encoded from the large amount of data that it had learned from.
And so, this large language model area of innovation is used and, of course, conversational chat, Q&A, summarization, text generation, image generation. But very importantly, it’s being used in life sciences for understanding chemistry. We’ve done some very important work in this area ourselves MegaMolBART, understanding proteins, understanding DNA to learn the language of these large -- very, very large, spatially as well as temporally or sequentially types of data.
And so, the impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It’s called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it the Foundation models that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs.
And so, we’re seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud. We were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because as you know, we don’t just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer like HGX.
And so kidding -- all of the components that have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component. And then furthermore, these data centers sit idle until the last piece comes together. And the last piece includes very complicated switches and very complicated NICs and networkings and cables. And so these -- building these high-performance computing data centers at very large scale for the world’s cloud is not particularly easy. And so the supply chain challenges have been somewhat disruptive. But the demand is there.
And on top of that, we’re ramping into Hopper, which is really a fantastic generation. Your next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. I wanted to follow up on the data center question that Vivek just asked from a couple of angles. I guess, Colette, the first angle being, in the release, you guys talked about pulling high $200 million of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October. So if you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up data center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins.
And Jensen, the second part, the moving pieces, networking stronger in data center, U.S. hyperscale stronger, China hyperscale weaker. If you could kind of walk us through the trends that you’re seeing into the October and January quarters. And in those sort of those breakouts and when clarify for us when you think H-100 will really start to drive revenue. Great. Thanks for the question. And it’s kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we’re seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through. Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It’s not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers orders components themselves, they’re looking from us what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers.
We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time from a logistics and availability to get those things out. Customers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we weren’t offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn’t be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2. So we worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand, and that’s what we’ve disclosed to you. Let me answer the questions about the North American and the China hyperscalers. The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they’ve been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well really slowed down in Q2. This slowdown can’t last forever. And the number of new technologies in software, the number of people who are using clouds and the number of cloud services is continuing to grow. And so I fully expect investment to return. They’re a very important market for us, a very large market for us. And the fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year-over-year our revenues at North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China said something about the slowdown in China. And so I don’t think that’s going to last forever. I think it’s going to return.
With respect to Hopper, we’re in full production now. And we’re racing to get Hopper 2, all of the CSPs are dying to get them. And it goes with our HGX, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray, it’s really a supercomputer in a motherboard, if you will. And it goes along with it networking gear and switch gear. And so there’s the enormous amounts of resources apply from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper. We expect to ship substantial Hoppers in Q4. Your next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I had a question regarding the $1.22 billion inventory charge, maybe for Colette, on this one specifically. In the CFO commentary, I think you stated that the inventory charge is related to weaker demand in both data center and gaming. I think the gaming side is pretty clear based on your comments so far. Curious what’s changed on the data center side? Is it mostly the Chinese hyperscalers that Jensen just spoke to? Or is there something else going on in terms of how you’re thinking about demand in data center over the next couple of quarters? And related to this, curious if the delay in Sapphire Rapids at Intel is having an impact on your business in the near to medium term? Thanks for the question. So our inventory charges, as we commented, we’re taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter as well as the quarter that we’re guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have. And so what is happening here for the data center, we had great, high expectations. We still have very strong, solid growth projection for data center as well. We’re going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces to write down those given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward.
So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for gaming. We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions and you get ready for our future product launches take into account, but there’s also components, services and capacity in some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs. Our Hopper supports previous generation CPUs. But I guess, next-generation GPUs, CPUs, Sapphire Rapids and Genoa after that as well as Graviton. And so -- so we certify and test across all of the CPUs because the cloud service providers demand it. And they intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators, NVIDIA Hoppers across a large number of CPUs.
There is no question that the delay is disruptive and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next-generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old generation, current generation CPUs as well. And so nobody likes the delay. The next-generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers. And so I’m super excited about them. However, we’re going to be able to go to market plentifying with Hopper supporting existing infrastructure. Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Yes. And a lot of it’s kind of been talked a little bit about, but I just -- Colette, I want to think about the numbers a little bit more. I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I’ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming and Professional Visualization and maybe kind of low to mid-single-digit growth in Data Center and Auto. So I guess, is that the right context?
And with that and with Hopper coming down the pipeline, we’re going to have a lot of questions around kind of the deceleration of year-over-year growth in Data Center, I believe. Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes? Yes. Thanks for the question. And that’s a pretty good understanding of our guidance. And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2. So that may be of our 2 areas of the decline, our gaming and ProViz, that may be about 3/4 of it associated with that gaming. And then Professional Visualization would probably be about 1/4 of the 2 areas that will decline.
Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it. There may be some more opportunity there. And automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter, we are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point. So we’ll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward.
I’ll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4 and expectations. The first thing I’d say, Aaron, is that we are selling in or we’re selling far below the market demand, far -- excuse me, far below the market sell-through. And the reason for that is to allow the inventory the channel inventory, the OEM inventories to correct. And this allows us to prepare for our next generation. And our next generation has Hopper for compute, but we also have the next generation for computer graphics that will be coming to market.
Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers. It has an engine inside it called Transformer engine with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer-type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers. And so I fully expect Hopper 2 to be the next springboard for future growth. And -- and the importance of this new model, Transformer, can’t possibly be understated and can’t be overstated. This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design is just really quite spectacular. And I’m sure that you’ve been hearing about this new breakthrough in AI, and Hopper was designed for this. Your next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Colette, can you talk about networking versus compute? Were they both supply constrained in the July quarter? And are they both sequentially growing in the October quarter? So within our Q2 results, we have been continuing to improve our supply for networking. We have a lot of important products that the CSP needs, many of our customers’ needs, and we have been working to really improve that supply. And we were able to set very strong growth in terms of networking, both sequentially and year-over-year. And as we move into the next quarter, we’re going to have to see which is going to be growth larger. We’re just going to have to take a lot once we finish that quarter. But our supply for compute is here. But as we’ve discussed, sometimes it’s important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs. So sometimes those are very important for us to deliver together. So we always have to keep that in mind. So it’s not always supply constrained, but there are certain parts of it that are. Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. I wanted to ask why did the supply constraints hit you guys so hard this quarter? I mean you’ve done such a great job in the last couple of years outgrowing really everybody in a very challenging supply chain environment. It hasn’t tripped you up at all. And it seems like now it’s kind of hitting you fairly hard at a time when, in other cases, it’s kind of easing. So I’m just kind of curious, what is it about the timing and how long does it sort of take? Or is that a Hopper issue? Is it related to other components? As you talked about, how long does it take to clear those issues up? Let me start and see if Jensen wants to add on to it. Our execution has absolutely been phenomenal. When you think about the challenges of we’re almost putting together a full data center for our customers and getting it shipped out. So we’re no different in the same way that the CSPs are challenging. We’re setting up their data centers as we’re such an integral part of that. And so networking has been short of supply. These are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having. So our supply arrived a little bit late in the quarter for some of our key products that we needed to get out. And putting that together caused some disruption in our logistics and distribution. We were pleased in terms of reaching the leverage of networking that we did, but we did have some challenges this quarter. Your next question will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. I wanted to go back to that data center inventory charge. You listed data center first when you talked primarily related to data center and gaming. Can you give us a feeling for how much of that charge was data center versus gaming?
And then to follow up on that, it did sound like to me that it was mostly Ampere and not Hopper change in expectations. Can you verify that or clarify it? And just talk about what’s happened with your expectations for Hopper? Have they gone up or down? Or has there been any change at all relevant to that inventory charge? Yes, Stacy. Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, whether it be memory. Remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the 2. Additionally, the value of our inventory for data center is much different than the value of what we have for gaming from an overall cost perspective. So we’re creating capacity opportunity, putting together all of those systems in terms of data center. It is prior architectures. Absolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provision has to do with that. So we took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed. Our expectations, our plans were higher. They’re still quite solid that we see in demand both for gaming as well as solid for data center, and that will continue. But we did have to just take a rightsizing of that note. Hopper was designed for transformers. The new transformers was going to be important. Nobody could have predicted the profound importance of large language models. Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, start-ups, industries, all exceeding everyone’s expectations. I don’t think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes. There’s a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were smallish in the old days, in the beginning several years ago, 3 years ago. And the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving towards probably several trillion parameters, the effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular. And to have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within 1 shot or 1 shot of trying or even no shots, are able to perform that skill is beyond anybody’s expectations, I would think. And so I think the -- the success of Hopper is -- reflects the amount of work and pent-up demand for large training systems that Hopper is going to go into. If that’s an indicator, I think Hopper is going to be a spectacular success. Your next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. I have a question on gross margins, Colette. The 65% non-GAAP number you’re guiding to, does that include or assume any additional write-offs on the inventory front?
And then just to expand on that, your mix is probably a tailwind to gross margins given that gaming is down significantly and data center is up a little bit. And I’m just wondering, are there any other offsets? Because I would have thought gross margins could actually be better than your longer-term model because of the mixed tailwinds? Yes. Thanks for the question. So our gross margins outside of the inventory charges in Q2 as well as going into Q3 is really about our sales mix that we have and probably also to understand that our sales mix in the next quarter for GPUs is not in the high end. And so that has impacted our gross margin as we move into Q3.
You are correct. We do expect that data center will assist in our gross margins but we also have growth plans in auto. Auto is below our company average, and so that will tend to offset some of those upper bound things that we will see in terms of data center. From time to time, there’s always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates. So nothing material is planned. But there is small scraps that may occur from quarter-to-quarter that are included in our gross margins. Your next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Colette, I had a clarification and then a question. So my clarification is whether October gross margins are benefiting at all from the sale of previously written down inventory. And then my question is whether you can give us the enterprise cloud split in data center because it sounds like the mix shifted more towards enterprise in July. And I think investors might want to see that as risky in the face of enterprise clearly slowing. So I’m wondering if you can give us that. Okay. No. No, there is nothing in our Q3 regarding those inventory provisions that we took in terms of earning that back, in terms of our Q3. Regarding our split between our hyperscalers and data centers and what we refer to as our vertical industries. They always tend to be about the same, 50% for one, 50% for the others. They’re still in about that range. We had discussed that our China hyperscales did not drive growth in terms of sequentially here. And so that did influence in terms of the hyperscales, but still we are approximately in that 50%, 50%. Your next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. On the weakness in ProViz, this is an enterprise-focused business, right? Granted, it’s a somewhat narrow vertical market, but it does sort of play into the market concerns that consumer is weak now, enterprise is the next shoe to drop. So is the decline in ProViz attributed to enterprise spending weakness? Or is there some other dynamic? And why or why not is this not a leading indicator for your enterprise and vertical industry segments within your data center business? So our Pro Visualization business, just in such a short time, they were in short supply and really trying to feed so much of the industry’s desire to both refresh and attracted to the new RTX workstations that were there. We were fueling both mobile as well as desktop for that market and growing quite nicely. Remember, all of last year, doubled the size of ProViz in 1 year. So right now, the OEMs are concentrating on their levels of inventory. We want to make sure that they can get through that inventory. But it -- keep in mind, very similar to our discussion on gaming, there is still solid demand. There is still solid demand. We just have to correct some of the inventory, but we still see both the opportunities that we’ve created for the market for these to be long-standing.
And your second question, remind me again? Whether the broader enterprise market is -- the verticals are going to be affected by that? I would say, first of all, we don’t know. Second of all, unlike like our Workstation business, our ProViz business, there’s no installed base. Most of the ProViz sales tend to be tend to be upgrades or replacements from something that has -- our installed base of 3 or 4 or 5 years that people -- whatever upgrade cycle they happen to have. And so in the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying are ProViz, our ProViz systems likely already have systems that they’ve been using. And so if they were to tighten up ProViz for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have.
In the case of our AI business, there’s no real installed base. These are all brand-new things that people are growing into. And the productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. And it’s not so much that the demand isn’t out there. Everybody would like to be more productive. Everybody would like to save more money. Everybody would like to move faster. It’s just that AI understanding and AI’s use is still spreading. And so we’re delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our Viz business have very different characteristics for that reason.
But what Colette said earlier is about our ProViz businesses last quarter is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory. Your final question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Let me ask a question. I just had a longer-term question about once your gaming business normalizes, with the absence of crypto in a general sense and with the merge coming, et cetera, how do you view the pricing environment? I know you guys really weren’t raising prices like we saw in the MSR key premiums in the aftermarket. But generally, your mix was quite rich over the last year or 2. You’re going to have lovely coming in that will obviously help the mix sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. But how do you think about it normalizing? Is that $2.5 billion per quarter sell-through rate comes, is the ASP mix across your stack about the same? Or does it go down because of the absence of that crypto tightening dynamic? I would say that without crypto dynamic, the mix would go down. However, the overall trend long term, the ASP is drifting up. And the way to think about that is a game console, when -- my first game console was $99. Lately, game consoles are selling for about $599. And the reason for that is because it’s more useful than ever. You use your gaming console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time. And GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. And we’ve always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console. And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time.
We also have GeForce in the cloud. And because GeForce in the cloud is hosting many gamers simultaneously, it tends to want to be a much more powerful GeForce. And so our cloud gaming GeForce tends to be -- our cloud gaming graphics tends to be a much higher end.
And so -- and then, of course, there’s the design aspect of it. Most designers and most creators are able to use GeForce these days. And they use their PC to create content, and much of that content goes into video games and/or they’re using video games to create their artistic content. And so the GeForce is not just for gaming for them. The GeForce is essentially their creative work station as well. And so there are several dynamics that are causing the ASP of GeForce to go up, and we’ve been seeing this trend for several years now. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. We’re navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment. In Gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We’ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month.
In Data Center, AI where computers are helping us write software that was impossible before is driving a computing revolution and transforming every industry. NVIDIA’s leadership in full stack data center scale, accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our data center products have never been stronger.
The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the Internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world. This next evolution of the Internet is called metaverse. We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world and be an open platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start.
Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next $1 billion business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry. Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry that all industries will be. We’re building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world’s enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies.
I look forward to next month’s GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming. AI’s continuing breakthroughs and building the metaverse, the next evolution of the internet. So join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA’s Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA’s conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I’d like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA’s Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. The content of today’s call is NVIDIA’s property. It can’t be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today’s earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All our statements are made as of today, November 16, 2022, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year-on-year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue, while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions.
Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S. cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics.
During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter.
We started shipping our flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper architecture in Q3. H100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro. Early next year, the first H100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. H100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both, AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers 3x lower total cost of ownership while using 5x fewer server nodes and 3.5x less energy.
Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models. Microsoft Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and H100 GPUs, Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform.
Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle cloud infrastructure the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H100. Cloud-based high-performance [Technical Difficulty] is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities rising demand for AI in the cloud.
NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. Our new Quantum-2 40 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum.
We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware, whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs. Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure softer partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, Palo Alto Networks and Red Hat.
The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing ‘22 has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing.
The number one most energy-efficient system is the Flatiron Institute’s Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVX, reference designed featuring the new L40 GPU based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual worlds using NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise. NVIDIA OVX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro by early 2023. We Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVX systems.
We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and BioNeMo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions.
Moving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4.
Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA, but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first Ada GPU, the GeForce RTX 490 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the Ada family, RTX 4080 and is available today.
The RTX 40 series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neural rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and helped supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year old classic game portal -- now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam’s top 100 most wish-listed gains. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350.
There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on Steam just hit a record of 30 million, surpassing the prior peak of 28 million in January.
Activision’s Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales, topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, Top Gun: Maverick; and Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. And this month’s League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out in minutes with 18,000 Esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play.
We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce NOW on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud G, handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razr 5G Edge.
Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4.
Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI, simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OVX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge.
Leaders in some of the world’s largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer, Lowe’s is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, HEAVY.AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter’s wireless network.
And Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability.
Moving to automotive. Revenue of $251 million increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers’ DRIVE Orin-based production ramps continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Volvo Cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. This is the first model to use Volvo’s software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both, DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Xavier, along with 30 sensors.
Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include Hozon Auto, NIO, Polestar and XPeng.
At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA DRIVE Thor Superchip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC roadmap. DRIVE Thor delivers up to 2,000 teraFLOPS of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and Ada architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems, simultaneously offering a leap of performance while reducing cost and energy consumption.
DRIVE Thor will be available for automakers 2025 models with Geely-owned automaker ZEEKR as the first announced customer.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 53.6% and non-GAAP gross margins was 56.1%. Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters.
We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December ‘23.
Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the H100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. And in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Orin design wins. All-in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center.
Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million.
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We’ll be attending the Credit Suisse Conference in Phoenix on November 30th, the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 5th, and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5th in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Colette, I just wanted to clarify first. I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So, I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. And then, Jensen, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let’s say, U.S. cloud CapEx is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why? Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. We had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 was relatively solid. We’ve indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business, it was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid and desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4 driven by the upcoming holidays as well as the continuation of the Ada adoption Vivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale, so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows. The second dynamic is AI. And we’re seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs and important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who’s using a device that is like a cell phone or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them.
The second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the Transformer, which led to BERT, which led to GPT-3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language. It could be the language of biology. It could be language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called genes LM, which is one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes.
The third has to do with generative AI. You know that the first 10 years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to perception AI. Now, the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product -- and this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI. You probably see it all over the place, whether they’re generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever.
And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we’re seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for these reasons. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. You started to bundle on NVIDIA enterprise now with the H100. I’m curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software monetization? And how we should kind of see this flow through the model, particularly with the focus on the AI Enterprise and Omniverse side of things? Yes. Thanks, CJ. We’re making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI Enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds. You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and startups of all kinds. But more so -- more than ever, we’re at the tipping point of clouds. And that’s fantastic because if we could get NVIDIA’s architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one -- has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there. It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their startups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world’s internet service providers.
Every company we’re talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so, over the last year or so, we’ve been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we’re doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world’s enterprise. That’s all software included.
We, a month ago, announced the same -- similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that Rescale, a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. Monite has been integrated into GCP. And we announced recently NeMo large language model and BioNeMo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack software into the cloud, so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software. If they would like to use it in the cloud, it’s per GPU instance hour; if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license and so -- license and subscription. And so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it.
The partners that we work with are super excited about it because NVIDIA’s rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both, new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so, our software stack is making really great progress. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso [ph] with Credit Suisse. Wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general. In the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations. And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges. And then in general, for your internal inventory, does that still need to be worked down? And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters? Thanks for the question, Chris. So, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So, when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down.
Now looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market, our Ada architecture, our Hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward. But I think we’ve done a solid job, at least in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Colette, can you -- I have a two-part question. First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So, one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it. And I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So, is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to? Sure. So, let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we’re working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It’s just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They’re usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see. So, I’m going to answer no, nothing that we can see.
Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We’ve always been looking at our needs long term. It’s not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand. So, that’s always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we’ve seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China, it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we’ll need for data center going forward, not led to our write-downs. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Collect, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues. You said gaming resumed sequential growth. But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto, gaming and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish? Are they all just like growing just a little bit, or is one of them actually down? Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary? Yes. Thanks, Stacy. So, your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you’re correct, is only growing about $100 million. And we’ve indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit. But our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we’re still working on correcting the channel inventory levels, to get to the right amount. It’s very difficult to say which will have that increase. But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Jensen, I think for you, you’ve articulated a vision for the data center where a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think. Could you just give us a sense of -- or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle? And maybe talk about Grace -- Grace’s importance for realizing that vision, what will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86, do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision? Thank you. Thanks Mark. Grace’s data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10. That’s not possible without special capabilities that are designed between Hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace. And so, it was designed -- Grace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to -- for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It’s all hot. It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using your service. It is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. And so, those kind of applications are really terrific.
We -- Grace, I think I’ve said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we’re still on track to do that. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years, near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong NIC and BlueField attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware. But we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. So, what’s the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters? Yes, if I could take that. The -- first, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing. We’re not -- we don’t serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our networking solutions are very high end, and they’re designed for data centers that move a lot of data. Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications, it is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center.
So, the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings frankly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics.
And so, these days, with disaggregated and AI application -- AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that’s where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on.
You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world. And it is completely powered by NVIDIA’s InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you’re going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important.
It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now, we’re doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking. It is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meta is doing on the AI footprint that they’re deploying. Jensen, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching? And maybe kind of build on that, how you’re positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking? Yes. Thanks, Aaron. The math is like this. If you’re going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%, the numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized. And so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very easy to achieve, the difference between NVIDIA’s InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself, a lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge of the -- within the network itself. We achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so, if you’re spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars on the infrastructure, the difference is really quite profound. Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. I actually had a couple of clarifications. Colette, on the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out. And again, you said it grew quarter-over-quarter. So, is that a fair assumption? And then I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800 -- I’m just trying to make sure I understand it. Isn’t that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute, or is A800 going to a different set of customers? Thank you. Thank you for the question. So, looking at our compute for the quarter is about flattish. Yes, we’re seeing also growth, growth in terms of our networking, but you should look at our Q3, compute is about flattish with last quarter. Ambrish, A800, the hardware, the hardware of A800 ensures that it always meets U.S. government’s clear test for export control. And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited. It is in the hardware that determines A800’s capabilities. And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute, the introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time. The company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected. But A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets U.S. government’s clear tests for export control. . Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. I’m hoping you can discuss the pace of H100 growth as we progress over the next year. We’ve gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there’s quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there’s supply available as well. So, does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective, or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let’s say, second half of ‘23? H100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now power limited, and because of this incredible transformer engine that’s designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for Hopper because of these new models that are -- that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models. Customers are clamoring to ramp Hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers.
Remember, NVIDIA is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It’s a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years. It’s unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. And so, we’re working hand in glove with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up Hoppers. We expect them to have Hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so, we are expecting to ship some volume -- we’re expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we’re expecting to ship large volumes in Q1. That’s a faster transition than Ampere. And so, it’s because of the dynamics that I described. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had you talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business. And I wondered if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you’re thinking there and what sort of drove the decision? And I guess the derivative of that, Jensen, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently. I mean what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you’re going to break things out differently, or is something changing about the mix of I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base. Thank you. Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about 7, 8 different companies. But the reality is there’s a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they’re purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is, where our research is, where our higher education is also purchasing. So we’re trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we’re seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we’re seeing in the hyperscales. Yes. Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that’s happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA AI in internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they’re doing it has grown a lot, internet service companies. And these are internet service companies that offer services, but they’re not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing. Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud, a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer; they are also a sell with partner.
On the public cloud side of their business, because of the richness of NVIDIA’s ecosystem because we have so many internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA’s full stack, the public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the sell with relationship they have with us. And it’s pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business would likely -- would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. And so, because the world’s CSPs, the world’s public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to -- lifting enterprise to the cloud world, it’s very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large. And so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Great. Thank you. Wonder if you could talk to looking backward at the crypto impact. Obviously, that’s gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward? And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road? We don’t expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 they bought a couple of years ago is upgraded to 4090 today. That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed if sold at the right price. And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never zero. And when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market.
But my sense is that where we’re going right now with Ada is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And early signs are, and I’m sure you’re also seeing it that the Ada launch was a homerun. That 4090 -- we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world. And so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market. So, we’re super enthusiastic about the Ada launch. We have many more Ada products to come. Your last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there were some mixed messaging in your remarks. I think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. And then when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So, I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you’re caught up to demand at this point. And then secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic, I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million. It’s becoming a bigger piece of your OpEx. So, curious how we should be modeling that going forward. Thank you. Sure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better. Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter, and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers there. Now that’s our supply. We’ve also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints issues. When setting up a data center, even getting a data center capacity has been very difficult. And therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they’re still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. So, that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply.
In our stock-based compensation, what we’ll see, it’s very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it’s a single date in terms of when that is priced. So, it’s difficult to determine. But stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees’ compensation and will continue to be. So, we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we’ll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Thanks, everyone. We are quickly adapting to the macro environment, correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our OpEx flat for the next few quarters.
Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of Ada Lovelace is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4290 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary Transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI. NVIDIA networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results. Orin is the world’s first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics, and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform.
These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services. NVIDIA’s pioneering work in accelerated computing is more vital than ever. Limited by business, general purpose commuting has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing. Scaling through general purchase computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for attending.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, February 22, 2023, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, year-on-year. Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center. Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues.
With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue.
Adoption of our new flagship H-100 center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H-100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H-100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x cluster in inferencing of transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H-100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models.
AI adoption is at an inflection point. Open AI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like [indiscernible], creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster.
Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across the AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities.
In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year.
During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA, AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI.
Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale, generative AI.
For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum 2 40 gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40 gigabit per second Spectrum 4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adopters and switches.
We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained model and new workflows for contact center, intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription and cybersecurity. Upcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers.
Now to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud business. Thanks, Colette. The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most. Today, I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer.
We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds.
Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP and others on the way.
At the AI platform software layer, customers can access NVIDIA AI enterprise for training and deploying large language models or other AI workloads. And at the pretrained generative AI model layer, we will be offering NeMo and BioNeMo, customizable AI models, to enterprise customers who want to build proprietary generative AI models and services for their businesses. With our new business model, customers can engage NVIDIA's full scale of AI computing across their private to any public cloud. We will share more details about NVIDIA AI cloud services at our upcoming GTC so be sure to tune in.
Now let me turn it back to Colette on gaming. Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market.
Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphic.
Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps.
In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-schools season.
There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling a 3 to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution.
Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.
And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce NOW Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year.
Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS.
Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% from [indiscernible] and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%.
At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global .
We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from TÜV SÜD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses.
Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%.
We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately %7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.
Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24. We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our 4 major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6 in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24.
Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked like a couple of hundred million or so? Just curious if you can unpack that a little bit. So I'll start and turn it over to Jensen to talk more because I believe this will be a great topic and discussion also at our GTC.
Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions. And we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. But there's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen. Yes, first of all, taking a step back, NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere.
By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective. You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1?
And then Jensen, my main question kind of relate to 2 small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market? Thanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year-over-year for our data center. We actually expect a great year. our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerated past Q1. Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster.
What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, it's new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models.
And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. So that's 1 thought.
The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting.
The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models.
The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This 1 architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere.
The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or 2/3 of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50x faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end.
And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way. And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- and yes, those are the 2 answers. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point kind of like the iPhone. And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? And then secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformative engine and Grace with high-bandwidth memory, how have you kind of your outlook for growth for those 2 product cycles evolved in the last few months? ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability.
What people were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood. But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program.
We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed. This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly, or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not.
And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and they're, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide.
The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build Hopper and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen & Company. Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing and [indiscernible] InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next 2 or 3 years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time? Yes, I appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our Data Center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of 8 Hoppers or 8 Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially 1 GPU. It's 8 chips connected together into 1 GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is 1 GPU.
So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud.
And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within 1 entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. And so this is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened towards the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications part cloud, part on the mobile device and so easy to distribute because of app stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI.
In no computing era did 1 computing platform, ChatGPT, reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. And so I think this -- the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. I have a clarification and then a question both for Colette. The clarification, you said H-100 revenue's higher than A100. Was that an overall statement? Or was that at the same point in time like after 2 quarters of shipments?
And then for my actual question. I wanted to ask about auto, specifically the Mercedes opportunity. The Mercedes had an event today, and they were talking about software revenues for their MB Drive that could be single digit or low billion euros by mid-decade and mid billion euros by the end of the decade. And I know you guys were supposedly splitting the software revenues 50-50. Is that kind of the order of magnitude of software revenues from the Mercedes deal that you guys are thinking of and over that similar time frame? Is that how we should be modeling that? Great. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let me first start with your question you had about H-100 and A100. We began initial shipments of H-100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. And this was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H-100 that we saw. What that means is our H-100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they were all wanting to get both get up and running in cloud instances. And so we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H-100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for
Your additional questions that you had on Mercedes Benz. I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently about getting ready to come to market. And you're right. They did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in 2 phases, about what they can do with Drive as well as what they can also do with Connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. So it aligns with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that and sharing that revenue over time. One of the things that, if I could add, Stacy, to say something about the wisdom of what Mercedes is doing. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. If you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedeses that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. And that's the vision that Ola has. And what they're building for, I think, it's going to be extraordinary. The large installed base of luxury cars that will continue to renew with -- for customers' benefits and also for revenue-generating benefits. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. I think for you, Jensen, it seems like every year a new workload comes out and drives demand for your process or your ecosystem cycles. And if I think back facial recognition and then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse and now generative AI engines, can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand-new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products?
And the reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services is -- seems to be a lot, better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. So -- and to the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today? Yes, Mark, I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. And so that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about.
Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly, highly paralyzed to offload them. But we're multi-domain. We could do particle systems. We could do fluids. We could do neurons. And we can do computer graphics. We can do . There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one.
Number two, our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform. Literally, the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration, number one. They like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it and the fact that they have so many people they can reach out to, to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. And then very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see -- they can reach so many users after they develop the software. And it is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications.
And then finally, this is a very important point. Remember, the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. And whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, at 10x in performance at about the same power every 5 years and then 10x every 5 years. That rate of continued advance has slowed. At a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world, and they can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable. You can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. And so all of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications. Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Colette, I have a question on data center. You saw some weakness on build plan in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-over-year acceleration in April and through the year. So if you can just rank order for us the confidence in the acceleration. Is that based on your H-100 ramp or generative AI sales coming through or the new AI services model? And also, if you can talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise vertical. Sure. Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect year-over-year growth in Q1 as well. It will likely accelerate there going forward. So what do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H-100 in market now. We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking. And then we have grades coming likely in the second half of the year. Additionally, generative AI, it's sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, one of those be start-ups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year. And then lastly, let's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an error here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated continuing. So as the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they [indiscernible]. I'm going to turn it to Jensen to see if has any additional things he'd like to add. No, you did great. That was great. Your last question today comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Jensen, you talked about the sort of 1 million times improvement in your ability to train these models over the last decade. Can you give us some insight into what that looks like in the next few years and to the extent that some of your customers with these large language models are talking about 100x the complexity over that kind of time frame. I know Hopper is 6x better transformer performance. But what can you do to scale that up? And how much of that just reflects that it's going to be a much larger hardware expense down the road? First, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. And the reason for that is AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufacture just physical goods. In the future, there will be -- almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in. That data center does exactly 1 thing and 1 thing only. It cranks on that data and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or an infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called the factory. And so I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud. Some of it will be on-prem. There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller. And so I fully expect that to happen, number one.
Number two. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x. There's a lot of ways for us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack all the way from the chip, all the way into the data center across the network through the software. And in the mind of 1 single company, we can think across that entire stack. And it's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason because we can innovate across that entire stack. So my expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere. This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Thank you. The accumulation of breakthroughs from transformers, large language model and generative AI has elevated the capability and versatility of AI to a remarkable level. A new computing platform has emerged. New companies, new applications and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses. The level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working towards for over a decade. And we are ready. Our Hopper AI supercomputer with the new transformer engine and Quantum InfiniBand fabric is in full production, and CSPs are racing to open their Hopper cloud services. As we work to meet the strong demand for our GPUs, we look forward to accelerating growth through the year.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue, with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections.
Starting with data center, record revenue of $4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year-on-year, on strong growth by accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets.
Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories, cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises. First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer AI applications for training and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS, and general availability at emerging GPU specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from Generative AI pioneers.
Second, consumer Internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting Generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed it's H100 powered Grand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams.
Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom, where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral (ph) to customers' innovation roadmaps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a $50 billion parameter model BloombergGPT to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question and answering.
Auto Insurance company, CCC Intelligent Solutions is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches, so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte for logistics and customer service and Amgen for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem. And with the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud.
Whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA Base Command, and AI frameworks, and pre-trained models. We provide them with the blueprint for building and operating AI, expanding our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing, and training methods.
We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud, that enable businesses to build, refine, and operate custom large language models and generative AI models, trained with our own proprietary data, credit for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models, NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D, and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences.
Each service has six elements, pre-trained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based sector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning, and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases.
ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform is an early adopter of DGX cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings, with the 1,000s of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers.
Generative AI is also driving a step-function increase in inference workforce. Because of their size and complexities, these workflows require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April, showed NVIDIA's inference platform deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry, with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads.
To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video, L40 for Omniverse, and graphics rendering, H100 NVL for large language models, and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLMs and also, recommendation systems and vector databases.
Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google Elf, Google AlphaFold, and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton, and French server with Google Kubernetes engine and it's cloud-based Vertex AI platform.
In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remain soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high performance networks which are essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand about training and inferencing.
Our 400 gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer Internet platforms such as Microsoft Azure. With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale, optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment.
For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI our high-speed Ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching, offers the highest available Ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400 gig Spectrum-4 accelerated AI networking platform next week at the COMPUTEX Conference in Taiwan.
Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which is 6x more energy-efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to the growing momentum for Grace with both CPU only and CPU/GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips will enable a new generation of super energy efficient accelerated data centers.
Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially, and down 38% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, end demand was solid, and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions, RTX Path Tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex Ultra-Low Latency rendering, and Max-Q, energy efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance and battery life for gamers and creators.
And like our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform or software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed-base a spectacular upgrade.
Last week, we launched the 60 family, RTX 4060, and 4060 Ti, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs for the first time provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 Ti is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July.
Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to run time. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and work stations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers, and NeMo's LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs, a supercharged platform for generative AI.
Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5 is now available with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $295 million was up 31% sequentially, and down 53% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as Public Sector, Healthcare, and Automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicked-off a major product cycle.
At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollout planned in the coming quarters. Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstation. Our collaboration with Microsoft transformed windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers, harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity.
At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, an NVIDIA fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure that includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy, and manage industrial metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year.
Microsoft NVIDIA will also connect Office 365 applications with Omniverse. Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitalize their workflows from design and engineering to smart factories and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, [indiscernible], General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover.
Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $296 million, up 1% sequentially, and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now stands at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years.
Sequentially, growth moderated as some NAV's customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect slower than expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD (ph), the world's leading manufacturer of NAV's. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the DRIVE Orin to its next-generation high-volume Dynasty, and ocean series of vehicles, set to start production in calendar 2024.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 64.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak level, and we have absorbed higher costs, and offset them by innovating and delivering higher valued products as well as products incorporating more and more software.
Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%, We have held OpEx at roughly the same level over the last past four quarters. We're working through the inventory corrections in gaming and professional visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business while also delivering operating leverage.
We returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of the Q1, we have approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter fiscal '24. Total revenue is expected to be $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by data center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events, Jensen will give the COMPUTEX keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, May 29 local time, which will be Sunday evening in the U.S. In addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6. And Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on The Age of AI on June 7, and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on June 12. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter fiscal '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 23.
Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results, and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to, what the key drivers are from April to July and perhaps some more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point, what kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you. Okay. So, a lot of different questions there. So, let me see if I can start and I am sure Jensen will have some following your comments. So when we talk about our sequential growth that we're expecting between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI large language models are driving the search and demand, and it's a broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups.
It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommenders are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing as well as in our networking business. So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance we provided to Q2.
We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see, and this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers.
They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises, but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer AI companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters and that's led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more. I thought that was great color. Thank you. Next we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess with data center, you are essentially doubling quarter-on-quarter, yes, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind. Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing their commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times, in the coming years, to best kind of match -- best match that supply and demand? Thanks so much. Yeah, C.J. Thanks for the question. I'll start backwards. The -- remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when I -- when the ChatGPT moment came. And it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot.
The integration of guardrails and alignment systems where it's reinforcement learning human feedback, knowledge vector data bases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way and it's the reason why I call it the iPhone moment, all the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product that can be and what capabilities it can have. And so we were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant as you know.
And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs, but on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. And the networking, and fiberoptics, and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the Smart NICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand-up a data center. And so we were already in full production when the moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half as Colette said.
Now, let me talk about the bigger picture. Why the entire world's data centers are moving towards accelerated computing. It's been known for some time and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full stack problem, but it is full stack challenge, but if we could successfully do it in a large number of application domain has taken us 15 years.
If sufficiently that almost the entire data centers' major applications could be accelerated. You could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for our data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It takes -- it costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth, but we didn't have it for 15 years.
And what happened is, when generative AI came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so, now we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions. The world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today, and $1 trillion, $250 billion a year, it's growing of course. But over the last four years, call it a $1 trillion worth of infrastructure installed. And it's all completely based on CPUs and dumb NICs (ph). It's basically unaccelerated.
In the future, it's fairly clear now with this -- with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information, it is very clear now that -- and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy efficient, that the budget of the data center will shift very dramatically towards accelerated computing and you're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak. While the world's data center CapEx budget is limited, but at the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers.
And so, I think you're starting -- you're seeing the beginning of call it a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of the data center from traditional computing, and to accelerated computing with smart NICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs, and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI. And we'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open. Thanks for the question. Could I just wanted to clarify does visibility mean data center sales can continue to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4 or do they sustain at Q2 levels? I just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my question is that, given this very strong demand environment, what does that do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? How do you see the competitive landscape change over the next two to three years? Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1. So, we are expecting not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here. But we are not here to guide on the second half of that. Yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half. Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction. Start-ups really-really well-funded and innovative startups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects. And many of you know about most of these. And so, we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time. But NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is, we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution.
And the reason for that is, because accelerated computing is two things that I talk about often, which is it's a full stack problem, it's a full stack challenge, you have to engineer all of the software and all the libraries and all the algorithms, integrated them into and optimize the frameworks and optimize it for the architecture of not just one ship but the architecture of an entire data center, all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models. And the amount of engineering and distributed computing, fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know.
And so, number one, it's a full stack challenge and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just the mind blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind blowing.
The second part is that generative AI is a large scale problem, and it's a data center scale problem, it's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or to data center is the computer, it's not the chip, it's the data center and it's never happened like this before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer and that's what you're trying to operate. And so in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and you have to understand data center scale, and that's what accelerated computing is.
The second thing is that -- utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and diversity of our architecture keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and do one thing only and incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized and it's hard to scale that up. And the thing is, universal GPU in fact that we accelerate so many stacks, makes our utilization incredibly high, and so number one is throughput, and that's software -- that's a software-intensive problems and data center architecture problems. The second is utilization versatility problem and the third is just data center expertise. We've built five data centers of our own and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers and we integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds.
From the moment of delivery of the product to do standing up in the deployment, the time to operations of the data center is measured not -- if you're not good at it and not – not proficient at it, it could take months. Standing up a supercomputer, let's see, some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about a year and a half ago and now they're coming online, and so it's not – it unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year.
Our delivery to operation is measured in weeks. And we've taken data centers and supercomputers and we've turned it into products, and the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible, and so. So, our value proposition is in the final analysis, all of this technology translates in the infrastructure, the highest throughput in the lowest possible cost. And so I think -- our market is of course very, very competitive, very large. But the challenge is really-really great. Next we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the data center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software, considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow? I'm curious of what -- where do you think we're at in terms of that approach in terms of the AI enterprise software suite and other drivers of software only revenue going forward? Thanks for the question. Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our nearest architecture and essentially, all products that we have. We are now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing. So, anything that we have here from a DGX Cloud and providing those services, helping them build models or as we've discussed the importance of NVIDIA AI enterprise, essentially that operating system for AI. So, all things should continue to grow as we going forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure, as well as the both availability of this offering, our ability to monetize [indiscernible] that as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen, if he needs to add. Yeah. We can see in real-time the growth of generative AI and CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already.
There are two segments that requires a new stack of software and the two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software, because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt, and for your proprietary use-case and your proprietary data, align it to your own principles, and your own operating domains.
You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high performance computing sandbox, and we that DGX Cloud, and create a model. Then you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any Cloud, because you have services and you have agreements with multiple Cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds.
And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundation for helping you create custom models and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack, GPU accelerated stack in the world that is Enterprise safe, and Enterprise supported. There are a constant patching that you have to do, there are 4,000 different packages that buildup NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine, end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow.
It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing, obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data, you have to process and package up and curate, and align and there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data, that could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time and so, data processing is very big deal.
And then the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model and the third is deploying model for inferencing. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an Enterprise that wants to deploy their engines, just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software in order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure, it has to be supported. And so, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second point.
The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics, you need to align the AI for physics. And aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software defined in robotic applications and industries. And so, Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform.
And so our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundation, AI Enterprise and Omniverse runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI as well as Omniverse. With GTP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI and AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them and so I think the -- in order to for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud, and into the world's Enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of -- you need new software stacks in order to make that happen and by putting it in the cloud, integrate it into the world's CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors. Next we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is Open. Thanks a lot. I had a question and then I had a clarification as well. So, the question first is, Jensen, on the InfiniBand versus Ethernet argument, can you sort of speak to that debate and maybe how you see it playing out? I know you need the low late -- the low latency of InfiniBand for AI, but can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out Ethernet like you are with on the compute side? And then the clarification, Colette, is that there wasn't a share buyback despite you still having about $7 billion on the share repo authorization. Was that just timing? Thanks. Colette, how about you go first? You should take the question. That is correct. We have $7 billion available in recurrent authorization for repurchases. We did not repurchase anything in this last quarter, but we do repurchase opportunistically and we'll consider that as we go forward as well. Thankyou InfiniBand and Ethernet are Target different applications in a data center. All right. They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. And InfiniBand has a really -- NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional roadmap. It's going to be really incredible. But the two networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory, if you will. If that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case and it's doing it continuously and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million.
The difference between InfiniBand and Ethernet could be 15%, 20% in overall throughput. And if you spent $500 million in an infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20% and it's a $100 million, InfiniBand is basically free. That's the reason why people use it. InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just -- it's too great to ignore, and you're using it for that one application and so, however, if your data center is a cloud datacenter and its multi-tenant. It's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs and is shared by millions of people.
Then Ethernet is really do I answer? There's a new segment in the middle where the Cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not only AI factory per se. But it's still a multi-tenant Cloud but it wants to run generative AI workloads. This new segment is a wonderful opportunity and at COMPUTEX, I referred to it at the last GTC. At COMPUTEX, we're going to announce a major product line for this segment, which is Ethernet focused generative AI application type of clouds. But InfiniBand is doing fantastically and we're doing record numbers quarter-on-quarter year-on-year. Next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on inference versus training for generative AI. So, you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess, two sub parts to that. Is that, besides inference basically scales with like the usage versus like training is more of a one-and-done. And can you give us some sort of even if it's just like qualitatively, like if do you think are influence is bigger than training or vice-versa, like if it's bigger, how much bigger? Is it like the opportunity, is it 5x, is it 10x, is there anything you can give us on those two workloads within generative AI, it would be helpful. Yeah. I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. You're always -- every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data. And so, you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a Vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured -- unstructured data that you have.
And so, whether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, a vector database, these are probably the three major applications of the three core engines, if you will, of the future of computing. It's all a bunch of other stuff, but obviously these are very three very important ones. They are always running.
You're going to see that more-and-more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence, an intelligence factory and in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth.
The inference part of it, are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that is integrated into workflows. But APIs of all kinds, there'll be 100s of APIs in the company, some of them they built themselves, some of them part that could -- many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. And they'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. And of course, there will be a whole bunch of Internet Service Companies.
So, I think you're seeing for the very first time simultaneously a very significant growth in the segment of AI Factories, as well as a market that -- a segment that really didn't exist before, but now it's growing exponentially, practically by the weak for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end, is that, the world has a $1 trillion of data center installed and they used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we know we've heard it in enough places and I think this year there is a ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law.
We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale-out data centers with general-purpose computing and that accelerated computing is the path forward and now it's got a killer app and it's got generative AI, and so the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarters capital CapEx budget would lean very heavily into generative AI into accelerated computing infrastructure everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the CapEx budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated net -- networking chips that connect them all. That the easiest way to think about that is over the next four or five, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI and so that's probably the easiest way to think about that and that's training as well as inference. Next, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I want to follow-up on that, in terms of the focus on inference. It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models, but the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. You can talk about the ramifications of that for you guys, is that where some of the specialty insurance products that you launched at GTC come in and just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down? Yeah. That's a great question. Whether your -- you start by building a large language model and you use that large language model very large version and you could distill them into medium, small and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you can put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth and they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizeability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile and it can do a lot more amazing things. And the large one would teach the smaller ones, how to be good AIs and so, you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so you start by building very large ones. And then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones.
Now, that's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 NBL -- which also have H100 HGX and then we have H100 multi-node with NVLink and so there is -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is, these are models, but they are connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out.
So, the input and the output requires a lot of pre and post-processing. The pre and post-processing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart and it's because the length -- the model itself is only call it 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing and post-processing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that.
And so, I think the multimodality aspect of inference, the multi diversity of inference, that it's going to be done in the Cloud on-prem. It's going to be done in multi-cloud, that's the reason why we have the AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem, it's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day, called project Helix, that's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow, and Adobe, because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so, there's all the diversity, and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described, in order to really address the whole space of it. Next we'll go to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today in your networking products. I mean, it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think so data center networking business is driving a part of $1 billion of revenues per quarter plus or minus, that's 2.5x growth from three years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox.
So very strong growth, but given the very high attach of your InfiniBand, Ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run-rate stepping up in line with your compute shipment? And then, what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, datasets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability, and so on? Yeah, Harlan. I really appreciate that. So, nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, the accelerator chip and in fact, it misses the whole point nearly completely. And I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software and networking, remember, we announced a very early-on this networking stack called DOCA and we have the acceleration library call Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it, because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect 10s of 1,000s of GPUs.
How do you connect 10s of 1000s of GPUs, if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great, and so that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have -- we have Mellanox as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high performance networking, that's the reason why our two companies are together.
You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with a really super low latency and it communicates using memory references, not network package. And then we take NVLink, we connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I described, going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at COMPUTEX in a few days. And then, that gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC, and the SmartNIC BlueField-3 that we're in full production with and the switches, all of the fiber optics that are optimized end-to-end. These things are running at an incredible line rates.
And then beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory -- the smart fact -- this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand new type of Ethernet that we'll be announcing at COMPUTEX, and so -- this whole area of the computing fabric extending connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together, all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. And so, we're -- I'm delighted you understand it, and but this -- we don't break it out, particularly, because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be.
We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components, so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up, it's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from Cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G and so this way of doing it is really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach. And our last question will come from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Jensen, and to the whole team. One of the things I wanted to dig into a little bit is the DGX Cloud offering. You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes, where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business, and the rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago. And as we look forward over the next number of quarters that Colette discussed to high visibility in the data center business.
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third-party, their own customers versus what of that big upside in data center going forward is systems that you're selling in, with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks Matt. It's -- without being too specific about numbers, but the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs clouds, and the reason -- and our DGX Cloud is -- the NVIDIA stack is the pure NVIDIA stack. It is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one.
Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets like, for example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse cloud to the world's industries. And the world's never had a system like that, the computing stack. Now with all the generative AI stuff and all the 3D stuff and the physics stuff, incredibly large database and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks, that kind of a virtual industrial virtual world has never existed before.
And so, we partnered with Microsoft to create Omniverse cloud inside Azure cloud. So, it allows us number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. And we go-to-market as one team and we benefit by getting our customers on our computing platform and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one; but number two, the amount of data and services and security services and all of the amazing things that Azure and GCP and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse cloud. And so it's a huge win-win.
And for the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they can do it anywhere. So one standard stack runs in all the clouds and if they would like to take their software and run it on the CSPs cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that, because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations. And long-term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSPs clouds. Okay.
So, our goal really is to drive architecture to partner deeply in creating new markets and the new applications that we're doing and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run in their -- in their everywhere, including on-prem and so, that -- those were the primary reasons for it and it's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the three CSPs and that we currently have DGX Cloud in and their sales force and marketing teams, their leadership team is really quite spectacular. It works great. Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong and now with generative AI supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full stack and data center scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered is the best path forward. There is $1 trillion installed in the global data center infrastructure, based on the general-purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era. Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated.
We are significantly increasing our supply to meet the surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content and with models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles and ground the facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications.
As we scale with cloud and Internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises. Whether within one of our CSP partners or on-prem with Dell Helix, whether on a leading enterprise platform like ServiceNow and Adobe or a bespoke with NVIDIA AI Foundations, we can help enterprises leverage their domain expertise and data to harness generative AI securely and safely.
We are ramping a wave of products in the coming quarters, including H100, our Grace and Grace Hopper super chips and our BlueField-3 and Spectrum 4 networking platform. They are all in production. They will help deliver data center scale computing that is also energy-efficient and sustainable computing. Join us next week at COMPUTEX and we'll show you what's next. Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.
During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, August 23, 2023, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.
During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion.
Let me first start with Data Center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models.
Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI.
There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as [indiscernible] packaging.
We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions.
At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results.
However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.
Our cloud service providers drove exceptional strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter, as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly two decades of full stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms.
Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer Internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta, recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram.
Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models and APIs.
We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbot, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud.
Virtually, every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI Copilot such as those just announced by Microsoft can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI Copilot and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers.
We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design.
Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enables users to create 3D scene background with the help of generative AI. We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services.
We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA HGX cloud. And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware.
VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbot, assistants, search and summarization. We also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor.
L40S is not limited by [indiscernible] supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers (ph). L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high volume data center standing out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inventing through the designing, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization.
NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers are fully optimized for VMware, Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HP and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Atmos (ph), National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center.
And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language model, recommendator systems and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA [indiscernible] switch system, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over [indiscernible]. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access.
Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of [indiscernible] and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners.
For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies.
Now moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktop. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% of the GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance.
Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops.
In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continue to expand. 35 new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur’s Gate 3.
There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to gaming. At COMPUTEX, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine or ACE for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to non-player characters. And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face.
Now moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse inside.
We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation. The NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation. In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology.
One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote [indiscernible] earlier this month was the conversion of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D [indiscernible]. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workload.
Moving to automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on [indiscernible] or associated with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA's GPU chiplet. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales. Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2.
Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries on customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise.
For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center with gaming and ProViz also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York. And the BofA Virtual AI conference on September 11. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21.
Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please poll for questions for us? Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of large model inference. So I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past.
And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on large model inference. And I think your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So let's take a quick step back. These large language models are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal. It does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language. And it has encoded or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied. What happens is, you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models. It's a process called distillation.
And so when you see these smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on and so forth. And you're going to see this going forward. And so you start from a very large model and it has a large amount of generality and generalization and what's called zero-shot capability. And so for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models miraculously has the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical.
On the other hand, you would like to have these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices, and so what you do is you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities on a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as good zero-shot capabilities. And so they all have their own unique capabilities, but you start from very large models. Okay. Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you. Just had a quick clarification and a question. Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? You think it's up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%? So just any sense of how much supply because you said it's growing every quarter.
And then Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that buy is not really growing that much. So what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years? So if I take your implied Q3 outlook of Data Center, $12 billion, $13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So just give some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years. So thanks for that question regarding our supply. Yes, we do expect to continue increasing ramping our supply over the next quarters as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, it's not something that we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building an HGX and many of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving their supply. The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now.
So what you're seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. It's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, $0.25 trillion of capital spend each year.
You're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time. Next, we go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of Data Center in the quarter, maybe even the guide is like systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100? What I'm really trying to get at is, how much is like pricing or content or however you want to define that [indiscernible] versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that? Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our Data Center as well as our Data Center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures in the market. Now when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. So both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center.
Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are great opportunities for enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer Internet companies. The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system. And Stacy, if I could just add something. You say it’s H100 and I know you know what your mental image in your mind. But the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly 1 trillion transistors in combination. Takes a robot to build – well, many robots to build because it’s 70 pounds to lift. And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. And so these things are technology marvels, and the manufacturing of them is really intensive. And so I think we call it H100 as if it’s a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go out really as HGXs sent to the world’s hyperscalers and they’re really, really quite large system components, if you will. Next, we go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the success. Jensen, it seems like a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension like how many person years you've invested in building it? And then part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on the -- what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation? Thank you. Yeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question. Let me see if I could use some metrics, so we have a run time called AI Enterprise. This is one part of our software stack. And this is, if you will, the run time that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning from data processing, the training of any model that you like to do on any framework you'd like to do, the inference and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center. It could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center. It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware.
You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud and just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node. It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU. So from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes to entire data center scale. So this run time called NVIDIA AI enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other.
And that run time is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our installed base for our stack. And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work. The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. And it's taken us two decades to get here. But what I would characterize as probably our -- the elements of our company, if you will, are several. I would say number 1 is architecture.
The flexibility, the versatility and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, from data processing to training to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference to the post processing of the data, tokenizing of languages so that you could then train with it. The amount of -- the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. But anyways, that's where we'll focus and it's fine. But when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost ownership. And the reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things.
The second characteristic of our company is the installed base. You have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform? And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large installed base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make.
And then the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud because we have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers that use our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption to develop and train and to operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot all the way to training and inference. And so we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise.
Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now, and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. And so reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems. And so we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach.
And then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering. It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years. Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every six months. And so these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so those in combination makes us special. Next, we'll go to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Great job on results and outlook. Colette, I have a question on the core L40S that you guys talked about. Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with? And if you can talk about the incremental profitability or gross margin contribution from this product? Thank you. Yeah, Atif. Let me take that for you. The L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing just very large models and a great deal of data. And so that's not L40S' focus. L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models, fine-tune pretrained models, and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transform engine. It's got a lot of performance. You can get multiple GPUs in a server. It's designed for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server, and everything about it is standard and so it's easy to install.
L40S also is with the software stack around it and along with BlueField-3 and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snowflakes and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners. L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise. And so L40S is really designed for a different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. And so the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start and the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get L40S deployed. Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remains unfulfilled, talking to some of your customers. As good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters. There's a demand, in some cases, for multiples of what people are getting. So can you talk about that? How much unfulfilled demand do you think there is? And you talked about visibility extending into next year. Do you have line of sight into when you get to see supply-demand equilibrium here? Yeah. We have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The demand – easiest way to think about the demand, the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand. The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs, but the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted.
And so what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. And so that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a singular application that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening. And data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting in a broad-based way. Next, we go to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen. Colette, I think last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your Data Center revenue, consumer Internet at 30%, enterprise 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer Internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful.
And then Jensen, a question for you. Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments. I guess I ask the question because there is a concern out there that there could be a bit of a pause in your demand profile in the out years. Curious if there's enough breadth and depth there to support a sustained increase in your Data Center business going forward. Thank you. Okay. So thank you, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our Data Center business. And we look at it in terms of combining our compute as well as our networking together. Our CSPs, our large CSPs are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2. And the next largest category will be our consumer Internet companies. And then the last piece of that will be our enterprise and high performance computing. Toshi, I'm reluctant to guess about the future and so I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that general purpose computing is just not and brute forcing general purpose computing. Using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too energy costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow.
And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that's what the industry is really responding to.
Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed.
And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds and you're seeing a whole crop of new GPU specialty -- GPU specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they're doing incredibly well. But you're seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. And it's because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI.
We're also seeing that enterprises want to do that. But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security and software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's all VMware. And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support not just the virtualization of CPUs but a virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking.
And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. And this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises. And in combination with HP, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI.
And so I think the answer to that question is hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend is very, very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift. Next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks a lot. Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to your -- to the compute that you're shipping? In other words, is like half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions more than half, less than half? And is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the GPUs? Thank you. Well, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs. We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. And the reason for that because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant, some 10%, 15%, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings. Basically, the networking is free.
And so, if you have a single application, if you will, infrastructure or it’s largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really a terrific choice. However, if you’re hosting for a lot of different users and Ethernet is really core to the way you manage your data center, we have an excellent solution there that we had just recently announced and it’s called Spectrum-X. Well, we’re going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but some of it, of the capabilities of InfiniBand to Ethernet so that we can also, within the environment of Ethernet, allow you to – enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities.
So Spectrum-X is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3 and it supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. And the additional performance is really spectacular. BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. BlueField, as all of you know, is a project really dear to my heart, and it’s off to just a tremendous start. I think it’s a home run. This is the concept of in-network computing and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with BlueField-3, and it is going to be a home run. Our final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is now open. Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for the question, putting me in here. My question is with regard to DGX Cloud. Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and how the momentum is going? And then Colette, can you also talk about your software business? What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business? And it does seem like it's already helping margins a bit. Thank you very much. DGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there. DGX Cloud's strategy is to achieve several things: number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We recognize that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world. 15,000 of them are startups. Thousands of them are generative AI companies and the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. We're working with all of the world's AI start-ups. And ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds. And so we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help blend them easily in one of our cloud partners.
The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. And so to be able to work closely architecturally to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific.
And then thirdly, of course, NVIDIA uses very large infrastructures ourselves. And our self-driving car team, our NVIDIA research team, our generative AI team, our language model team, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite significant. And none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips.
And so the internal -- our own consumption of AI, our robotics team, so on and so forth, Omniverse teams, so on and so forth, all needs AI. And so our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud. And so DGX Cloud has multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to just an enormous success. And our CSPs love it, the developers love it and our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world. And let's see if I can answer your question regarding our software revenue. In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they're our Data Center products, GPU systems or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products. You're correct, we're also selling it in a standalone business. And that stand-alone software continues to grow where we are providing both the software services, upgrades across there as well.
Now we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business, and we are looking at NVIDIA AI enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces. So we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for any additional or closing remarks. A new computing era has begun. The industry is simultaneously going through 2 platform transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing. The $1 trillion of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency and cost. Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift.
Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. NVIDIA has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world’s industry -- world’s industries can build upon. What makes NVIDIA special are: one, architecture. NVIDIA accelerates everything from data processing, training, inference, every AI model, real-time speech to computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO and best energy efficiency.
Two, installed base. NVIDIA has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large installed base to reach end users and grow their business. NVIDIA is the developer’s preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make NVIDIA more valuable for customers. Three, reach. NVIDIA is in clouds, enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments and robotics. Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs, computer OEMs can confidently invest in NVIDIA because we offer significant market demand and reach. Scale and velocity. NVIDIA has achieved significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus and scale to deliver a strong road map and reach to help them grow.
We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We’re upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI. While we increased the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we’re ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale, for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers. Spectrum-X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3 Super NIC and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper.
We’re extending NVIDIA AI to the world’s enterprises that demand generative AI but with the model privacy, security and sovereignty. Together with the world’s leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware and WPP and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world’s enterprise. We’re building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world’s multi-trillion dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity. Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world’s largest industries, where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for NVIDIA, our customers, partners and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $16 billion. Starting with data center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year.
NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing.
Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our data center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving.
Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI.
NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances and high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities.
Toward the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of data center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter, though we believe they'll be more than offset by strong growth in other regions.
The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China, continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promote U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and support U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our data center product portfolio to offer compliant solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advanced notice before each shipment.
We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue.
Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies, including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100, InfiniBand and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative, and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years.
From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of customers.
This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH 200 Grace Hopper Secret chip, which combines our ARM-based Grace GPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU-specialized cloud providers and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers, initial system shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, took place in the third quarter. 
The U.K. government announced it will build 1 of the world's fastest AI supercomputer called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Jülich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance.
All in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand as AI is now in full production for deep learning recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text-to-image generation. And this is just the beginning.
NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility and thus, the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of NVIDIA TensorRT LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance or half the cost of inferencing LLMs by NVIDIA GPUs.
We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Llama 2. Combined, TensorRT LLM and H200 increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just 1 year without customers changing their stack. This is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the [ A100 ], H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for infancy models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year.
At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stack in our DGX Cloud, all with enterprise-grade securities and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100.
The H100 remains the top-performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on the nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments.
Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs.
Microsoft made this very point last week highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose-built for AI will be available in Q1 next year with support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional ethernet offerings.
Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support and services offerings. We see 2 primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX Cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively.
Our latest DGX Cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Genentech; the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnerships with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come.
Okay. Moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year, with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season, with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technologies now available at price points as low as $299. We enter the holidays with the best ever lineup for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels, even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS.
The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrade and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new killer app for high-performance PCs, NVIDIA RTX GPUs define the most performant AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers.
Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Phantom Liberty and Starfield.
Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering and simulation use cases, and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in health care and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs, offering up to 2x the AI processing, ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine-tuning AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally.
We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse-powered digital twins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. [ Axon ] is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced 2 new Omniverse cloud services for automotive, digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous vehicle simulation engine.
Moving to automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership with Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, our next-generation automotive SoC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software-defined car.
Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher data center sales and lower net inventory reserves, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits.
Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by data center with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP Other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on November 28, the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7 and the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21.
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Just, Colette, wanted to clarify what China contributions are you expecting in Q4? And then Jensen, the main question is for you. Where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just look at the trajectory of your data center, its growth, it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year. So what metrics are you keeping an eye on to inform you that you can continue to grow? Just where are we in the adoption curve of your products into the generative AI market? So first, let me start with your question, Vivek, on export controls and the impact that we are seeing in our Q4 outlook and guidance that we provided. We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4.
The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term. We are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation-compliant solutions that do not require a license. These products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4. Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. The -- at the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text to text, text to image, text to video, text to 3D, text to protein, text to chemicals, these are things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches.
The way that we access data is changed. It used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about.
And 1 of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use the -- use the software.
We'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so the transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. And you could see that it's transforming hardware in 2 ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's 2 trends. One is related to accelerated computing. General purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy. You could save an order of magnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. And so accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general purpose computing into this new approach.
And that has been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about 1/3 of that. But there's a new class of data centers. And this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure and that data center stores a lot of files, these new data essentials are very few applications, if not, one application used by basically one tenant. And it processes data. It trains models, and it generates tokens. It generates AI. And we call these new data centers AI factories.
We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country. And so if you look at the way -- where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave, you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups and consumer Internet companies. And we're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms.
You're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people -- countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data and develop their own AI. You see that in India, several -- about a year ago in Sweden. You're seeing it in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France.
But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have -- and surely, every major country will have their own AI cloud. And so I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Yes. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited, I think it's 155% year-over-year and strong growth sequentially, it looks like that business is like almost approaching a $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved -- evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year. Yes. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion plus run rate. And it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardized on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and the -- a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency that -- and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's natural part of InfiniBand.
And so InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric. We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We'll do floating point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic.
And the difference is profound, and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up, is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of 4 or 5 years, it really, really adds up. And so InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories.
However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building custom AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, the -- recently, we spoke about one of the models that we're creating. It's called ChipNeMo. We're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company.
And our company is -- for all of our employee use, that doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories we use to train the models. And so we would like the AI to be able to run an Ethernet environment. And so what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace the Ethernet. It's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with BlueField as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some, and we achieve excellent results.
And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so HP, Dell and Lenovo have the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stack. And now they integrate with BlueField as well as bundle -- take to market their Spectrum switch, and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers the -- in a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized at least end-to-end AI solution. And so that's basically bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Great. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications? Yes. Thanks for your question. Grace Hopper is in production in high-volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high-performance computing and AI, AI infrastructures. We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us.
The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously has very fast memory as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factful data before it generates a response, that data is quite large.
And you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically stored an entire book into its system memory before you ask the questions. And so the context length could be quite large. This way, the generative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand; on the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, your data and be contextually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so the -- that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper.
It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and like to build up a stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are a variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri of UBS. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility that you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts. I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, the China bands would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So I know we're not even into 2024 yet, and it doesn't sound like, Jensen, you think that next year would be a peak in your data center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that data center can grow even into 2025? Absolutely believe that data center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already [ wanted ] the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world.
Remember, people think that the GPU is a chip, but the HGX, H100, the Hopper HGX, has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- it has -- even its passive components are incredible, high-voltage parts, high-frequency parts, high-current parts. It is a supercomputer and therefore, the only way to test the supercomputer's with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated. The testing of it is complicated. The shipping of it is complicated and installation is complicated. And so every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated.
And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly, not to mention all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking, and the networking, the transceivers, the NICs, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world class.
But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. We have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming up from all over the world as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them. They have to -- they should. They have the skills and fairly with us, in combination, we can help them do that, build up their national AI. And so the first thing that they have to do is create their AI cloud, national AI cloud.
You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has 2 paths. One path -- or if I could say 3 paths. The first path, of course, is the off-the-shelf AI. And there are -- of course, ChatGPT is a fabulous off-the-shelf AI. There'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI because these software companies like ServiceNow and SAP, and there are many, many others, can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools. And on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base.
This is -- they're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI Foundry, where we leverage NVIDIA's capabilities to be able to serve them in that.
And then the next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches running our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell and Lenovo, so on and so forth.
And so we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs moving to consumer Internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then -- and ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together. And that is a really, really exciting work. And so I think the -- we're at the beginning of a, basically across the board, industrial transition to generative AI, to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. I wanted to clarify something with Colette real quick, and then I had a question for Jensen as well. Colette, you mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months, yet the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue? And could it be a source of reacceleration in growth for data center in April and beyond? Or are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited?
And then the question for Jensen, the AI foundry service announcement from last week, I just wanted to ask about that and hopefully have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work? Is it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long-term opportunity set? And is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft? Or do you have plans to expand to other partners as well? Thanks, Toshiya, on the question regarding potentially new products that we could provide to our China customers. It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the U.S. government of our intent in these products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter. That's just going to take some time for us to go through and discussing with our customers their needs and desires of these 2 products that we have.
Moving forward, whether that's medium term or long term, it's just hard to say both the ideas of what we can produce with the U.S. government and with the interest of our China customers. So we stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time. Toshiya, thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company, our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies, we create tools. And most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms. And those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire.
And these AI platforms just got to go across the world, and you'll see. And we've already announced a few, SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty. Many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so they come to us.
We have several things that are really essential in the foundry just as TSMC is a foundry. You have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability, AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice, known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails, fine-tuned, so on and so forth -- that are safe, so on and so forth.
And the third thing is you need factories, and that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs are called NeMo, and they run on NVIDIA's factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that, with each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together. They bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We'd bring our researchers and engineers. We help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible.
Then that customer AI becomes theirs, and they deploy it on a run time that is enterprise grade, enterprise optimized or outperformance optimized, runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud on-prem anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise.
NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year. That's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then, with that basic license, can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways, we're wholesale. They become retail. They could have a per -- they could have subscription license based. They could per instance or they could do per usage. There's a lot of different ways that they could take to create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system. And so our business model is help you create your custom models. You run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Colette, I wanted to know, if it weren't for the China restrictions, would the Q4 guide have been higher or are you supply constrained in just reshipping stuff that would have gone to China elsewhere? And I guess along those lines, can you give us a feeling for where your lead times are right now in data center? And does the China redirection such as this, is it lowering those lead times because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship? Yes. Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, they are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which has defined our revenue.
But with the absence of China, for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China but we no longer can. So could our guidance have been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply and plan on continuing and growing all throughout next year as well towards that. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Congrats everybody on the results. Jensen, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive. You'll be less differentiated, et cetera, et cetera. So I guess the 2 parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or 2 ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload. So the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference, and I think that's a large part of the workload now, maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Sure. Inference, inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you -- we, this quarter, announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers called TensorRT LLM. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub. It's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously.
We could create TensorRT LLM because CUDA's programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT LLM on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of 2.
And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of 2. And so our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by a factor of 4 within about a year's time. And so that's really, really hard to keep up with.
Now the reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. And we've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud. It's in every -- available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. And any time you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it, if you will -- architecture compatibility is job one.
And that has conveyed to the world the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability, certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs, and we have such a large installed base large -- millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPUs from people's PCs, just about every workstation in the world, and they're all architecturally compatible.
And so if you're an inference platform and you're deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. And as a software application provider, you're looking for a large installed base.
Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to curate the data. You have to dedupe the data. Maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So you process the -- clean the data, align the data, normalize the data. All of that data is measured not in bytes and megabytes. It's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. In what you -- in ultimately creating a data-driven machine learning service. And so data processing is just a massive part.
We accelerate Spark. We accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did that is called cuDF pandas, without one line of code, pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA and just out of the box without a line of code. And so the acceleration is really quite terrific, and people are just incredibly excited about. And pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really data processing for data science. And so NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that. Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. If you look at the history of the tech industry, right, those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem, silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships and just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time. The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence and data center from 2 years to now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization, inferencing, CPU, GPU, DPU networking. How do we think about your R&D OpEx growth that looks to support a more aggressive and expanding forward road map? But more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity? Gosh, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan. And you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When -- the combination of TensorRT LLM and H200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of 4, and so that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly, it's because of our software. Mostly, the software benefits because of the architecture. And so we want to accelerate our road map for that reason.
The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different, and yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them.
And not to mention, we then take the whole thing, and we create AI factories that are stand-alone. We take our platform. We can put them into supercomputers. We can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something -- generative AI to enterprise is something nobody has ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that.
And so the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. It includes all of the domain-specific libraries that we create. The reason why you -- every computer company without thinking can integrate NVIDIA into their road map and take it to market and the reason for that is because there's market demand for it. There's market demand in health care. There's market demand in manufacturing. There's market demand, and of course, in AI, in financial services and supercomputing and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad.
And then finally, now we have an end-to-end solution for data centers. InfiniBand network -- InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions, technology solutions and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers, the largest ecosystem of system makers, the largest and broadest distribution partnership network, and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes -- surely, that takes a lot of energy.
But the thing that really holds it together, and this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When you -- when we develop a domain-specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach.
And so that discipline, that architecture compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world. Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general purpose to accelerated computing and Generative AI. Large language model start-ups, consumer Internet companies and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity.
The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center and AI factory, optimized for refining data and training and inference and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment, expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI industrial revolution.
NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted 3 elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride, CPU, networking and software and services.
Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year-over-year and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories.
Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI, and Ethernet is the standard networking. This week, we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution of BlueField SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HPE and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking and software to the world's enterprises.
NVIDIA software and services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise and scale to help customers build custom models. With their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise-grade NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry. NVIDIA's GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle.
Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. This concludes today's conference call.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.
With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year.
Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached a tipping point of new computing era. The trillion-dollar installed base of Data Center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skywalk, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern Data Centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI.
In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-on-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.
Fourth quarter Data Center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our Data Center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference.
Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale. Enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private cloud or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy.
In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-on-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first 2 months than the 2 previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases.
The consumer Internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.
In addition, consumer Internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. All the customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP, and Snowflake.
The field of foundation of large language models is thriving, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.AI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world's many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion, pharmaceuticals and generative biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU-specialized cloud providers.
Just this morning, we announced that we collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the-art new Gemma language model to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, data center, and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as Automotive, health care, and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low-latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full-stack accelerated computing platform.
We estimate that Data Center revenue contribution of the Automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions include systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, curation, labeling, and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications.
In effect, nearly every Automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive Data Center processing demand to grow significantly.
In health care, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging, and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in health care over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara health care platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for the proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem.
In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI.
Shifting to our Data Center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our Data Center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single-digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in Q4, and we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter.
In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems.
From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubled the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers.
Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year-on-year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest-performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the Ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the Data Center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over Ethernet that are purpose-built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro with their global sales channels are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter.
We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners.
Okay, moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year-on-year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor Cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI TOPS, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating and everyday productivity.
The rich software stack we offer with our RTX DPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, 7 out of 8 pixels can be AI-generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the TensorRT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large language models, generative AI can run up to 5x faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEM. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14-inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 TOPS of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best performing AI PC platforms.
At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially, and up 105% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, Automotive, and robotics.
In Automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize workflows from design, to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers, including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like Lotus are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience.
Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleet. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter. Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong Data Center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases.
Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in Data Center and ProViz, partially offset by seasonal decline in Gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.
In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4; and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Health Care Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in person for the first time in 5 years. GTC will kick off with Jensen's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19.
At this time, we are now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jensen on the Data Center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within Data Center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium- to long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that? And if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions. One more time? First question was... OpenAI. I guess your expectations for Data Center, how they've evolved. Okay, yes. Well, you know we guide 1 quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth, calendar '24 to calendar '25 and beyond, and let me tell you why. We're at the beginning of 2 industry-wide transitions, and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you could tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from 4 to 6 years. There's just no reason to update with more GPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to.
And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20:1, huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. In generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it.
And the third is, it is enabling a whole new industry. And this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at, and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time, a Data Center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of the company. We now have a new type of Data Center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory, and you've heard me describe it as AI factories.
But basically, it takes raw material, which is data. It transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA built, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible start-ups in digital biology generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on.
And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of Data Center. And this Data Center, we call it AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We're seeing diversity. One of the other reasons -- so the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, you know that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that are being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA's doing inferencing.
The inference part of our business has grown tremendously, we estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You could see from their CapEx and their discussions. But there's a whole new category called GPU-specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU-specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI.
ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe, there's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI, so they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multibillion-dollar businesses: auto, health, financial services, in total, our vertical industries are multibillion-dollar businesses now.
And of course, sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different, and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them. Each one of the regions around the world, the data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data, they want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation into AI and provision those services themselves.
So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West will surely be replicated around the world. And these AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. It's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe the year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume it's, in some cases, the same GPUs are used for training and inference. How solid is that measurement? I'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated and -- but we estimated it, and let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, a year ago, the recommender systems that people are -- when you run the Internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because, as you know, the Internet has trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there, and your phone is 3 inches squared. And so the ability for them to fit all of that information down to something such a small real estate is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems.
These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU accelerating for reranking. And it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. And as you know, a recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet.
Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe, these are all generative models. The list goes on. And none of these, as I just mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new. Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. I wanted to -- Colette, I wanted to touch on your comments that you expected the next generation of products, I assume that the Blackwell to be supply constrained. Can you dig into that a little bit? What is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained? Like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25? Like when do those start to ease? Yes. The first thing is overall, our supply is improving. Overall, our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us. Everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators to transceivers and networking and cables, and you name it, the list of components that we ship. As you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip, but the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated things we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason.
If you ever look at the back of the Data Center, the systems, the cabling system is mind-boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world has ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year-over-year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides, and through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best.
However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from 0 to a very large number, and you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a new generation of products and right now, we are ramping H200s, there's no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of Ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X, Ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system.
But with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of Ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation so that we could optimize Ethernet for AI. And so InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure, Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking, and that is ramping. So we'll -- with all new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products, and we work as fast as we can to catch up with the demand. But overall, net-net, overall, our supply is increasing very nicely. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask, I guess, a 2-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was getting at on your demand being significantly more than your supply even though supply is improving. And I guess the 2 sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of buildup of product that might not yet be turned on?
And then I guess, Jensen, for you. I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about a thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller start-up companies to things in the health care arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling. And I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about ""fairly allocating"" sort of for the good of your company but also for the good of the industry. Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally.
So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that allocation and both helped us with our communications with them. First, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product road map and transitions. And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place and where and when. And so they know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities and, of course, allocation. We allocate fairly. We allocate fairly, do the best of our -- best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily.
As you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when a Data Center is not ready? Nothing is more difficult than to have anything sit around. And so allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. And where we do -- the question that you asked about the end markets, you know that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs, and very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the health care companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies, there's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging. There are warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies.
All of these start-ups -- large companies, health care, financial services, and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. And oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. And so this ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. But at the core of it, we want to allocate fairly with avoiding waste and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments, but if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to take as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower? Or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog? Yes. So let me highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand, given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for.
The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, component that we need for manufacturing but also often we are procuring capacity that we need. The length of that need for capacity or the length of the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next 2 quarters but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are predesigned to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need as several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward.
So wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long lead times or things that need a capacity to be built for us. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Congratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that it should go back to the mid-70s, if you don't mind unpacking that. And also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products? And what do you think are the drivers of that comment? Yes, thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks, really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those 2 quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefit from favorable component cost in the supply chain kind of across both our compute and networking, and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. So looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. So we're really looking at just a balance of our mix. Mix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year and those are really just the drivers. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Bigger picture question for you, Jensen. When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out? C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One is that it's accelerated, and two, it's programmable. It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally at the very beginning when CNNs and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through RNNs to LSTMs to every RLs to deep RLs to transformers to every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers that every single -- and now time sequence stuff. And every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base.
This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor Cores, like our Transformer Engine for Tensor Cores, improve new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor Cores, meanwhile supporting the installed base at the same time. And so as a result, we take all of our new software algorithm inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand.
On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary, like Transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper Transformer Engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better. So our customers' installed base is enriched over time with our new software.
On the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden, amazing breakthroughs in large language models were made possible. And those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand, we make giant breakthroughs on the other hand. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in the prepared comments, you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also pointed out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single-digit percent of your total Data Center business. So I guess the question is, what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market? And why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that opportunity again? At the core, remember, the U.S. government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. And the U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars, if you will, are the restrictions. And so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused, so that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. And that took some time. And so we reset our product offering to China, and now we're sampling to customers in China.
And we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the specifications of the restriction. And so that's it. This last quarter, we -- our business significantly declined as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. But after that, hopefully, we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out. Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Jensen, Colette and NVIDIA team, first of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about -- a little bit about your software business, and it's pleasing to hear that it's over $1 billion. But I was hoping, Jensen or Colette, if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business. In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from. Let me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams, and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. And whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them, and their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams, and we enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing.
As you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing, SQL versus SQL structured data versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine learning to computer vision to speech to large language models, all -- recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries.
If you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now people understand that software is really key.
And the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing, and when it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow, to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing, all of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem.
So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market with it is think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system. It's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge $4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously, for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang, CEO, for closing remarks. The computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand with increasing throughput while managing cost and energy. The incredible speed-up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world.
We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this industrial revolution. Every company and every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI.
Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world data center infrastructure installed base in the next 5 years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.
This new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer Internet companies. And now every industry is on board, from automotive to health care to financial services to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform with industry-specific application frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem gives us the speed, scale, and reach to help every company, to help companies in every industry become an AI company.

Let me highlight some upcoming events. On Sunday, June 2, ahead of the Computex Technology trade show in Taiwan, Jensen will deliver a keynote which will be held in person in Taipei as well as streamed live. And on June 5, we will present at the Bank of America Technology Conference in San Francisco. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $24 billion.
Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue.
Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud provider's investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over 4 years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud.
For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time to train models, the lowest cost to train models and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, The Depth, Anthropic, Character AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud.
Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. NVIDIA Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.
Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries.
As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing 4 quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs.
From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use.
For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia.
NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation.
We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require a port control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3.
We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA, HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over 4 years.
With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100  [indiscernible] we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.
Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that 9 new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe; Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the U.K.; and Jupiter in the Jülich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the #1, the #2, and the #3 spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.
Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet.
Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.
At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion-parameter scale AI.
Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper's launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads, and data center environments in the first year shipments.
Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton and PrintServer and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics, and digital biology.
enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem.
Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX Super GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor cores. Now with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts, and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs.
NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs.
And top game developers, including Games, Tencent and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine (sic) [ Avatar Cloud Engine ] to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and nonplayable characters.
Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3D Xcite, Systems, Brand and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year.
Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations.
Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets.
We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's iOnHyper and Neuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year.
Okay, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments.
In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10 as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately -- excuse me, approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments. Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence.
AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers.
Strong and accelerated demand -- accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction.
From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills, and at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence.
Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations.
Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you. Thank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now? We will be shipping -- well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4. Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like? We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year. Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Yes. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air cooled, liquid cooled x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC -- that I showed at GTC. And so for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100.
And so Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming a pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional. Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth? Well, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, and then -- but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.
There's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application -- productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models, to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary.
We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up.
So anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. Longer term, that's what -- that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer.
And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. And so every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so that's going to change computing stacks all over the world.
And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the startups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary. Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I understand what you just said about how strong demand is. You have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth? We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect to be -- we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible. Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward? We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference.
And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of 3. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software.
So one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data center.
Second, we're in every cloud. And so for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem, we're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so that's the second reason.
The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more an apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just 1 large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together.
And so the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of 2, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of 2, the value, too, is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so the value of it is really quite extraordinary.
And this is the reason why today, performance matters everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to  fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so the highest performance is also the lowest TCO. Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training. Some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but, it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on, it's going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product.
So I'd like you to -- if you wouldn't mind speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, you're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Yes. I really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming.
And then there's a short -- we're in a 1-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, okay? And so there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it. So that's the smart thing to do.
They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI.
And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership and want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better.
And so leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is 3 months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time to train on 3-months project, getting started 3 months earlier is everything. And so it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so that's the second reason.
The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're doing -- we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly? Because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides a little good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all year.
Now one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here, but then we disaggregated and integrated into our customers' data centers however they liked. but we know how it's going to perform and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today.
We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So I appreciate. Those are the 3 points. Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know.
So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general purpose framework? Yes. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so there is a -- the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose compute, not for accelerated computing. And so I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it.
There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run-time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing.
The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls, is fairly large. And every single 1 of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along, or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. And now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory. the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context.
All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for 1 model. But to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain but obeys the first principles of software, that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models.
There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it and we're ready for it. And so the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And it's not -- if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer. Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about -- I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin. I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out. H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products. Well, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best.
But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year. Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Yes. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell G200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even.
And so you're going to see liquid cooled version, air cooled version, x86 visions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now of course, the Blackwell platform is -- has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient.
And so it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center, and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking. Of course, NIC, we have Ethernet now so that we can bring AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only operate -- only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around. Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there are reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Price CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper, Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side, whereby while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge? Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the 2 chips, calling it 2 chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The 2 of them are connected with this interface that's like at terabytes per second. It's off the charts.
And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into 1 giant GPU.
And so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs. Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation and your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. CUDA, Precision, Grace, Cohere and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess, maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today? Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a 1-year rhythm. And so -- and you can also count that -- count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet.
We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric.
And we're committed -- fully committed to all 3 links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so we're going to take all 3 of them forward at a very fast clip. And so you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all 3 of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming.
And all of it -- the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers and everything just runs.
And so I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale.

Let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be attending the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 11 in San Francisco, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20, 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer Internet and enterprise companies.
Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our Data Center growth include generative AI model training and inferencing; video, image, and text data pre and post processing with CUDA and AI workloads; synthetic data generation; AI-powered recommender systems; SQL and Vector database processing as well. Next generation models will require 10 to 20x more compute to train with significantly more data.
The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing 4 quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our Data Center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and start-ups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and health care, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity, given the high demand.
NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and a significant contributor to our Data Center revenue. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward.
The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell platform combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA, with the top computer manufacturers, unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost effectively.
The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink and Link Switch and the networking chips, systems and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30x faster inference for LLM's workloads and unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time. Hopper demand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26.
In Q4, we expect to several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.
Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers and enterprises, including xAI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.
Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year.
The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity.
Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build [ dual ] copilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build copilots. And lastly, is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%.
Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Health care is also on its way to being a multibillion-dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery.
During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1 collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business.
Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. NVIDIA NIMs accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across health care, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowes, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8x latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription and classification.
Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM Agent Blueprint, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM Agent Blueprint, enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM Agent Blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation.
Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM Agent Blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth.
Moving to gaming and AI PC. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI.
NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX AI PCs. Megabreak is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small language model, Nemotron 4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow. Recently added RTX and DLSS titles include Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Awakening and Dragon Age: The Vanguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service.
Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems.
And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multiyear contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workloads, accelerating our ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing the USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as The Coca-Cola Company.
Moving to automotive and robotics. Revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramp in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving upscale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Boston Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsyc, Siemens, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids and mobile robots.
Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion toward shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per shareholder. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2.
Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
As our Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid- to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments and publicly held equity securities.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions? [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there's a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back-end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing, what that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. And so we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell, Grace Blackwell, and a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex, and we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4. And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customers' customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx?
And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook and how should we think about fiscal '26? Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out, I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production but shipping up. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. And you've heard me say that we're going through 2 simultaneous platform transitions at the same time.
The first 1 is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time and it has slowed to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world.
In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer.
And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly.
The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multitrillion-parameter models and train it on -- pretrain it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so which caused the generative AI revolution.
Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just the capability. It's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function.
And so you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable.
And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically.
And so it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 10x, 20x, 40x more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so the first 1 is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI.
The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs. It's now moving from CPUs to generative AI.
So recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper-targeting, search and user-generated content, these are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners.
And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of the company.
And then general robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse, we are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating. And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country.
So more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us. And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. But it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like. Yes. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example.
Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's and the new one, Polar's. These are the ones -- the most popular data processing platforms in the world.
And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number 1 is the primary -- the #1 use case long before generative AI along is that the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing.
The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers, they're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money, they want you to put it to use now.
You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a fair -- that's 1 reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be -- get to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership.
NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society, we want to see all that come true.
And so these model makers are the same. Of course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing.
They don't want to build any more general purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper. Of course, H200 is state of the art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state of the art. And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Jensen, wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of this CapEx. And hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI.
I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so 1 way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles. You have $1 trillion worth of general purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not?
And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already.
And so recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system?
So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it. And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth, both near and longer term. I know Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling, and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp?
And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation.
Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated.
With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta. And I think it was Volta. And so we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go to liquid cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid cooled data center, in any data center -- power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 to 5x the AI throughput compared to the past.
And so liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. And that, we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput large language model inference, and the large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine.
Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our Data Center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through 2 platform transitions at the same time. And that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software. Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. I have 2 short questions for Colette. The first several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars?
And the second question on gross margins. If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have [ 75 ] for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up. Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that.
Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting ramping in Q4. So I hope that helps you on those 2 pieces. Your second piece is in terms of our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are. And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out, and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there. And obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks. What are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter, given all those favorable revenue dynamics. Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure in a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with 1 key piece. The pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to, and so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer. These are just moving to our OEMs or ODMs and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio.
So what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China. Keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also Data Center, also automotive in those numbers that we have.
Going back to your statement and regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. Determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that, that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture. And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more, given rising complexity in a rather limit advanced package world. So curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships, and then taking through a consequential impact to your margin profile? Yes, thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that we'll reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it.
And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability, fairly uniquely, to integrate, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX for East and West, BlueField DPUs for North and South, and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet.
And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this, we have 1 architectural stack, as you know, it allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build -- somebody's got to build up an AI factory, and the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it.
We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro. We used to be able to serve ZTE. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers, the scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrated supply chain, is vast and gigantic because the world is huge.
And so that part, we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So anyways, that's the reason why. And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle. I guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out? Yes, Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different.
And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components. Like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy.
And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think because we show it as 1 rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration.
Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator, we want to be a technology provider. And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks. Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top 5 things, the top 5 things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible.
Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Ariel and for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one.
Number two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell vision took nearly 5 years and 7 one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI.
Blackwell AI factories are building size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized, the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides 3 to 5x more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper.
The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into 1 NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in 1 rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU.
For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have 3 networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before.
Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure.
And NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI, general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of Nemo, NIMs, NIM Agent Blueprints and AI Foundry. That our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications.
Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise run time, and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.
