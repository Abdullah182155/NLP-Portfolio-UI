Welcome to the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 18, 2018. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to  Skip Miller. Go ahead, please, sir. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President, Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 first quarter results. Length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they were received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2018 results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook. Wolfgang, if you will. Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018. Q1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong DUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily driven by strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales. Logic, which now combines foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 170 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018/2019 share buyback program remaining. Moving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers, and on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems. High-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. The initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment. The options were sold for EUR 50 million each, with payments starting this year. At this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and backlog going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we establish our joint demand forecast with our customers, they are very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy and therefore does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provides limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year. We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year. On EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment. We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019. For the full year, our shipment plan has changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness. The 2 affected systems this year will ship early 2019 and will not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion versus EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. I would like to highlight, though, that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million. Gross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43%, impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. R&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million. We have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. In Q1, EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share through our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million. We are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong, with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and have committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter. Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter regarding our next-generation EUV technology of high numerical aperture or High-NA. We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers, targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also sold to customers options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. Now this is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade. I will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted, had a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets. Although this not -- this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year. And in [ some ways ] stronger Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory, and stronger EUV will be primarily driven by logic. We plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018. It may be interesting to note that of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers. Memory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, a number of customers continue to ramp greenfield -- new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stack-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography. With strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year. Logic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes, while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year. On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production. Demand from our customers continues to be strong as they start ramping this technology in production. With a plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of output over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations. As Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged. As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems. As mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems. In addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduces the execution risk. And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include 0.33 NA, 0.55 NA EUV, dry and immersion Deep UV, i-Line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production. In Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity means we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. In addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period. With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency. In Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption, with recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple pattern fidelity metrology tools, ePfm5, and are seeing initial positive customer results. This technology, where ASML's high-resolution e-beam technology is combined with our computational lithography software, will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production. To further drive e-beam productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years. To summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our view of the year than we were a quarter ago due to the continued strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets, with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year. And so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. It goes without saying that at least with ASML, we'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely, you can rest assured. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. All right. Thank you, Wolfgang and Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, we have your final instructions and then the first question, please. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad. All right. Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China on -- did I hear correctly that now you're seeing 7 domestic companies in China, whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5? Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry? Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are -- like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes but also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is -- basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives. There is NAND initiatives. So it's the -- I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify first product, which will take some time. So we have to be careful with -- although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product. Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you have seen this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your orders, the orders in memory had declined a lot. Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they are ordering, and even though the memory industry profitability is very high, they're kind of building to meet the supply -- the demand that they are seeing? Yes. First, to talk about memory you have to split between DRAM and NAND, the way that we calculate this is that of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus -- basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, I have sometimes the view that we're parroting after each other. We're all using the same percentages. There's not a lot of difference there. So this is on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know -- we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped. Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know this pretty well. With NAND, it's a bit of a caveat there as you have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks and, of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having. Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best-positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use, basically applying the same methodologies with DRAM, taking how many systems do we have in the field, what's the productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on, yield assumption. And that's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think there are a little more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned. On the order trends, well, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it -- you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18-months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and on  technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything. When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business is, it is based not on the order flow, it is based on the continued discussions we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans, their technology transitions. And that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake. The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you have given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance, 13% of EUR 11 billion, on a quarterly basis, it is higher. Why it is higher? And is it going to sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of this R&D, given that, I mean, just what Peter said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV are really going to happen in 2024, et cetera? So it's a very long way away as yet. And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with -- in High-NA EUV given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such a important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important supplier now and probably yet even more important supplier. And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML. Okay. Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size. But we are also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multi-beam solutions. We do firmly keep our 13% of revenue envelope in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of a percent of revenues that will keep that in front of us. As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. So we manage ourselves based on the U.S. GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative. Yes. On your second question on will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business, I think from a product cost, yes. I think [ from the start ], there will be optics in there. Of course, it will be the EUV source there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different. To start with the optics, I mean, I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also, we've agreed with them that we will co-fund their R&D as well as their CapEx. And the way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as a ""2 companies and one business"" kind of venture. So it means that we should both have -- and there's an equal internal rate of return. Only as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, somehow you need to get an absolute euro return, which is also significantly higher. And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pre-investment whereby you get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today. And secondly, we use a -- we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for a different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with. The next question comes from Mr. Hameed Awan. Yes. It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales. Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original tool sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that? Alex, so just to be clear, 2-7-0, that's EUR 270 million is the initial price of this tool. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen for the next couple of years. And like I said in the prepared remark, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments, and they go at EUR 50, 5-0, million apiece, and those payments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology in as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the ZEISS business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow. Helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up, you obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iteration to the current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years? Well, we -- with that, we will do what we always do. I mean, when we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, how you want to calculate it. And in fact, we just split that value increase 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is very much driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, over the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers. Our next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse. I guess, Peter, first question. You've got the longest-lead time equipment in the industry. So curious, as you think about announced and unannounced greenfield capacity as well as emerging spend out of China, could you talk about visibility and how you're thinking about 2019? I know it's only April, but would love to hear your thoughts. You're talking about 2019 for the total business or  for China? Sorry, the question was specific to your Deep UV business in aggregate as you take into account the visibility you have plus your longer lead times. Yes. I think you have to -- I think it's way too early to go anything -- to start guiding on 2019. But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's technology transitions. I think technology transitions, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amounts of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark Liu also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So -- but that -- the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand, yes? So I mean, what we're currently seeing in memory, for instance, is also a big user of our Deep UV systems, and it's driven by the demand out of the data centers. So it is really -- as a question, what you're asking is really the question about, will we -- do we believe that the end demand will stick? It's strong today. Will it stick in 2019? I think the general belief, and I'm quoting also customers, is that they believe that it actually will, that the technology transitions will indeed happen. So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our -- that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions. And of course, we don't have a crystal ball, you don't have it, and we just have to see how that will develop over the next couple of quarters. Sure, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is, how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pull-in of some of the deferred revenues? And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable? Yes. On the gross margin, I think it's right to assume that we are steadily increasing the margin. I mean, we're not spelling it out anymore because of movements between quarters and also how the gross margin is done and how we sell to customers. But in general, that is indeed the case. And we've also talked about our EUV business. I mean, you have seen, in the first half, we were over EUR 150 million in first quarter, 600 in the -- almost EUR 600 million in the second quarter. It was EUR 2.1 billion for the year, so you see we have 2 heavy quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up. Yes. On the shift of the 2 systems, yes, I mean, if you do -- if we said 30 before, 30 plus 2 is 32, I think I can do that math. But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we are going to have because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think, to be -- to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units. I would, for the time being, stay at the 30 units. The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Actually, Peter, just as a follow-up, 7-nanometer plus wasn't supposed to lead to any meaningful changes to the design as it relates to the EUV insertion. It has -- it had more to do with demand set. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement especially with the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV? Well, I think actually, that's pretty fastened and is already as a key attention for our customers. I mean, that's a question really to ask our customers, but I can give you some qualitative indication. I mean, when we talk to our customers, they actually are very happy with the progress that they're making on their 5-nanometer designs also using EUV. As what we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where they are with their customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But -- we don't know, but the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic, and I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly. We listen to our major customers and what they say about EUV. I mean, it's pretty bullish. So, that's not us, and that's the only thing I can say, Mehdi. I mean, we get similar feedback from them as they are publicly stating. Sure. And just a quick follow-on on DRAM. Last call, you talked about trying to target a 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally upbeat about adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on the DRAM adoption of EUV? Especially as you -- as we go from 1x to 1y, there's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline, and I'm not sure about the cost benefit. And is that impacting? And then any context of a throughput target? If you could provide any incremental color, it would be great. Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer's situation what they will go for. I think -- but you're right, I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of a generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, bear for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of the wafer per hour throughput, which we said we actually reached 25 and in -- at the customer's site and then 40 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And then it's a function of the availability, which is actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%. We're executing on that target with some good achievements made over the last quarter, especially on the collected degradation. We are getting the collected degradation under control,  so we are a little bit ahead of our target there. So then -- and we're rolling out several improvements -- availability improvement, as we speak, which actually mean that we have some major upgrades ongoing in the field. So if you would take average availability today, that is hampered also by the fact that we have to take tools down to do those upgrades. So -- but it -- but that all looks very much that we're on target to reach our over 90% availability when customers need it. But that incremental improvement isn't enough to get you excited about 2019 shipment? That remains to be seen. I mean, like I said, 1 to 2 layers. Whether it's 1 or going to be 2 layers is up to the customers to this, and we're early in the -- in Q2 of 2018. I think customers will change their minds as they see performance going up in the course of this year. I think that's what they will do. So they'll very likely -- and I'm a bit assessing the situation that -- of course, they won't tell us everything in detail, but they will have plan A and plan B, which is a 1-layer application or a 2-layer application. So -- and that really depends on the progress that they will see throughout the year, and that will drive their implementation in 2019. But like I said, we're on our targets -- we're on our way to meet our targets for 2,000 wafers per day for the DRAM application. There are many availability solutions that we're currently rolling out into the field. So throughout the year, we'll know more. The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, perhaps more on the demand side than sort of your capacity supply side. Peter, a couple of quarters ago, you had said that sort of the theoretical demand you were seeing from customers was sort of about 30% above the 30-tool capacity that you had for 2019. There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitment, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and they're comfortable with the progress you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that -- in your expectation of the layers. So is -- it's 2 quarters on from when you first said that. Is the demand level for 2019 still at that kind of a level, so far outstripping the capacity today? Yes. I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently looking at for their ramp because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is -- there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity -- build capacity. Okay. I suppose to put it another way, then sort of from a logic point of view, the 10 layers or more, you still stick to that sort of the layer count expectation? Yes, but that is a method of how big is the end market. So it's also a way, a bit of how quickly do they want to ramp to a certain first phase of that node, yes? So that is also, of course, determining whether how much the end demand will be over our capacity. The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. It's Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. I'd just like to get back, Peter, on what you said about the memory markets, I listened well -- you have, like, very good insight in how capacity is building up and that you see it's meeting very well the capacity demand. My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of [indiscernible]   today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant. So could you explain us, maybe is there an easy way to explain us why in order to increase its capacity, the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago? Is that because shrink is delivering less bit growth and then it [ rings ] to more capacity? And is that something you see as a new normal, as something that will be sustainable over time? Well, it is clear that they are spending more now than they did a few years ago in terms of litho tools. It doesn't mean that your cost per bit goes up, no, because you're actually shrinking. So the cost per bit, even if you spend more on litho and on equipment, as -- I don't need to explain it to you. But then your cost per bit still goes up, and then that still goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of -- it's been a long time that we've seen memory prices, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing, while you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said memory is a commodity, and a commodity has a high-price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite. I think the demand is extremely high, and that means that even customers that end customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, it's -- that's an easy choice you have in that market that wants your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost, but your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see, if the end market is not there, they will buy less, and they will just squeeze everything out of the current installed base. So I don't see the issue, yes? And I don't think customers see the issues because they see the end markets, they see their profit margins, they see the opportunities. We don't see, and certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply. So they buy what they need, and it costs a bit more, but they also earn more. Okay, that's very clear. So cost of bit  still  comes down, but it just, over time, gets translated into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like plans, you started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers. Do you have an early insight on whether stacking up NAND like that is delivering on its promise in terms of where you're seeing the cost per bit. Do you have visibility on that already? Well, the cost per bit, when you stack and you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So now from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stacks-of-stacks. I mean, that's what every customer confirms. Now the big question is, after how many stacks do you need another? Well, after how many layers do you need another stack? That might be different customer per customer. But that's a thing that is certain to us. So yes, cost per bit will go down with vertical scaling. But like I said earlier, the ultimate cost is also a function of a couple of things. And one of them, a very important thing is, of course, yield. When yields go up, cost per bit goes down. It's that simple. The next question comes from Mr. Dave Mulholland. It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just quickly on the -- you made a comment earlier to say you're still increasing your DUV capacity. And I guess over the next year or 2, as you start to ramp up EUV in volume more significantly, there's general expectation DUV will go into decline. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand how you think about your DUV business over the next couple of years and why increase capacity now in that context? I think when we say we increase capacity, don't think about adding square meters, building factories and putting tooling in. I mean, it's really, yes, you get a bit more people in because you just work somewhat longer hours. But the most important part is operational efficiency. So you're reducing cycle time in the factory and basically getting more machines out using -- at the same fixed cost. That's how you do it. Okay. So it's not to say that you suddenly got a more optimistic view on payer [indiscernible]  on a 2-, 3-year view? No, no. I think we are increasing capacity because the customer demand is there. And like I said, you can do this in a couple of ways: by taking the long route, and that's basically building a factory and hiring people and don't change your processes; or you can drive down cycle times and just get more out of the same square meters. And that's what we're doing today. [indiscernible]   And it's cheaper. That's clear. And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion, you've made a few comments on value and pricing. But just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA, start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA? Yes. We'll start from a much better starting point. You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and the warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our return on investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools. The next question comes from Mr. Douglas Smith. It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2, low NA and High-NA, won't coexist, that High-NA will just take over eventually? That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology, that you see a cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the absolute critical layers. It will be an expensive tool, EUR 268 million, but it will provide not only more productivity but also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means, for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need that shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that we're currently seeing and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life. Okay,  very clear. And one quick question. The metrology and inspection business looked like it had a pretty small quarter. Are there some issues going on in that business? Oh, it was -- I don't know how you come to that conclusion. We had -- of course, the whole business is within our systems number, and a part of it is within our service number. But we didn't have a bad quarter. We -- this whole business is steadily increasing. And Holistic Lithography altogether is probably the strongest-growing business amongst all of our businesses. The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku. It's Adi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So I have 2 questions. Firstly, looking at the growth drivers in 2018, you're saying you're confident that memory has increased in the last quarter. Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different to the revenue recognition numbers. So how should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year? I'll take the second one. You're right, if you take Q2, we guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize revenue at the point of shipment. We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems, and we recognized only one. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to be much more in sync. So you have that one catch-up order in Q2. Yes. And on the growth drivers for 2018, yes, it is memory. We've -- throughout the quarter, we've seen there's a steady increase of the -- or let's say a change in the demand plans from key memory customers. And when I try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw -- from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand plans. And as we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast, and more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer, taking into account our own lead time. And this is where we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense. I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM obviously with the DRAM pricing, and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for memories where they can make most money, which in this case is DRAM. And all that's happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand. And we're able to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that -- it's -- that's what it is.  It's just the more clarity that we've been given by our customers on what they need this year. Okay, understood. And just a quick follow-up if I could. There is a lot of concern around this news article that recently came out around Apple not using EUV at TSMC. Do you have any thoughts around that? And finally, just all the best to Wolfgang. I hope your time at Bayer is just as exciting as it's been at ASML. I'll let Wolfgang answer that last one. Just listen, I mean, we never comment on what customers of customers say because, yes, this is always -- we hear this constantly, customer A is going to supplier B and then switches back to A. There's many, many rumors in this space. What we focus on is what our customers are telling us on what they need and the orders that they place and the commitments that they want from us in terms of their tool demand. And that has not changed actually. And this is why we have a very healthy backlog, and we took 9 EUV orders in Q2. So whatever is out there is going to be whatever it is in terms of rumors, but customers are committing hard euros to us to get tools. And that's what counts. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you are unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question. The last question will come from Ms. Tammy Qiu. Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Firstly, can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multi-beam tools. You said that in the presentation, you already demonstrated the first 9-beam tool. And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a high ASP with  existing system? Or are you going to sell that, too, as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of beams you can bundle into the single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real multi-beam tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization. Okay. Now the trends foundry and logic, like we said, we have a very detailed demand planning forecast process with our customers. I would agree with you that we see foundry and logic being very strong. I don't feel that we're currently looking at a significant uptick in that strong demand. I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early to -- for us to currently help you with any indication on an accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process, and our own process says it's going to be pretty healthy, that it's pretty stable. Now on the e-beam, yes, 9-beam is a prototype, so we've made the -- we captured the first images. And as we showed also in the presentation, the more beams that you have, the more servers you can actually inspect in one go. So that means the whole focus is on maximizing the potential number of beams. And the -- since that is a productivity advantage, a significant one, that also means that the value out of a tool like that will be higher than a single tool. So you could actually say that the value of the tool scales with the number of beams. And that will also -- it's too early to give you an indication of what that would mean. We'd rather discuss it with our customers first. But the potential number of beams, we're not disclosing anything yet. I mean, there are several companies working on their solutions. We'd like to keep it a little bit to our chest, but the 9 beams is just first prototype to show that multi-beam works, and we're very hard to -- we're working very hard to maximize that to the point where we have the highest value out of this type of solution. But I can tell you one thing: it's going to be significantly more than 9 beams. All right. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here at our headquarters in Veldhoven on the afternoon, November 8. We hope you'll be able to join us. Now on behalf of ASML's board and management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I would appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2018 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating.

2018-07-18,18,7,2018,192.68605041503903,-0.030794757059600775,0.0,0.9986,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2018,"Mr. Wennink, the second quarter of 2018 was again a good quarter for ASML. Can you talk us through the numbers? Yes, the second quarter was a good quarter. We ended above EUR 2.7 billion in sales. It was higher than we expected. Gross margin, above 43%, which was a contribution basically of all our product groups from Deep UV to EUV. They all were -- all are a little bit better. We booked close to EUR 2 billion of orders. We shipped 4 EUV systems. 7 EUV systems were in revenue; both memory and Logic business, strong; good, solid quarter; good financial performance. How do you currently view the markets? It's a good question. Yes, I think it's not a surprise if I tell you that the proliferation of chip technology we now see across the globe in almost anything. I mean, we think about all these great new applications, the artificial intelligence, big data, IoT. And that is basically very much dependent on the global economy. I mean, so as long as the global economy is healthy, which it is today, I think our industry will do fine. On top of that, I think it is important that our customers and ASML have now more confidence in what I would call the logic road map. That means that the high-power compute that's necessary for all those great applications can be secured because we have this road map now for 10, 15 years laid out, and it's being supported by EUV. Now if you have a very good and solid logic road map, then the derivative of this that you need very good memory. So you need fast DRAM, and you need a lot of storage. So all in all, we look very positively at the total market. And when it comes to memory, what's your view on the memory market? Yes, I think memory is -- like I said earlier, memory is very important to support all the new applications. When we look at DRAM, DRAM bit growth, generally, between 20% and 25% is needed by our customers. The technology transitions in DRAM will provide anywhere between 10% and 12%. So you could say approximately half. The other half is needed by more wafers, and that means we need to add wafer capacity. And that's what customers are doing in a balanced manner. And that means that the supply-demand balance in DRAM is actually quite good and very healthy. On 3D NAND, we have more players. There's higher investment levels there but also a lot higher growth numbers. But it means that from time to time for a few quarters, you might have some supply-demand imbalances. But over the medium term, it's shorter than the medium term, there is no worry at our side if we look at what our customers are asking us to provide in terms of capacity. And when we look at the, let's say, mid-40% growth rates, it's pretty much in balance. So I think also the memory business is pretty healthy. With regard to new EUV tools, how are you progressing with EUV? With respect to EUV, we've made a lot of progress over the last 6 months. Very clear, we've made breakthroughs in terms of tin management. We've now shown productivity or throughput, real numbers, which are actually our target -- targeted numbers. That has all been shown to our customers over the last 6 months or so. That has actually given us the confidence that this strong execution, with that, we can accelerate also the 0.33 NA road map. We have now productivity targets or throughput targets that we plan for end of '19, early '20, we're pulling them in into 2019. Same is true for the availability targets, which actually gives us and our customers access to a lot more value earlier. So that's very good. And it also means that what we are seeing in terms of EUV demand for 2019, and we plan for about 30 shipments, that is a very realistic number based on what we're seeing today and on the pull-in of the accelerated road map. Going back to this year, what's your outlook for the next quarter? For Q3, we expect the sales to come in between EUR 2.7 billion and EUR 2.8 billion; gross margin, between 47% and 48%. We are looking at healthy logic shipments, healthy memory shipments. On the operating expense, on R&D, I'd like to highlight that we're going to increase our R&D expenditure because of the pull-in of the 3400 EUV as a 0.33 EUV product, the acceleration of that road map and the acceleration or the pull-in of the High-NA road map that will both lead to the higher R&D expense. In terms of sales and the rest of the year, Q4 will be up from Q3. That means that the second half for 2018 will look better in terms of sales and profitability than the first half. And we think that, that trend will continue in 2019.",the second quarter of 2018 was again a good quarter for ASML . we ended above EUR 2.7 billion in sales; it was higher than we expected . it was a contribution basically of all our product groups from Deep UV to EUV .,1.0

Welcome to the ASML 2018 Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on October 17, 2018. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Go ahead please, sir. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven in the Netherlands is ASML CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2018 third quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us for our Q3 2018 results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the third quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of the third quarter financial performance and -- with some added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. And Roger, if you will? Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the third quarter accomplishments and then provide our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018. Q3 net sales came in at EUR 2.78 billion, which was towards the higher end of our expectation. Net system sales of EUR 2.08 billion was a bit more weighted towards memory at 58%, with the remaining 42% from logic. EUV revenue of EUR 513 million was from 5 shipments. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 695 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%, just above our expectation, reflecting the strength of our Deep UV and Applications business as well as the progress in EUV profitability. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses basically came in as expected, with R&D expenses at EUR 397 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 122 million. Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 362 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q3. This leaves around EUR 1.7 billion on the 2018/19 share buyback program remaining. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 2.95 billion. Moving to the order book. Q3 system bookings came in at EUR 2.20 billion. Memory order intake continued to be strong, 64% of total value. Logic made up the remaining 36% of the bookings. We took 5 new EUV orders in the quarter, which contained a mix of both logic and memory. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect Q4 total net sales of about EUR 3 billion, leading us to expect another record year with close to EUR 11 billion of revenue. Our total net sales forecast for the quarter includes around EUR 500 million of EUV system revenue from 5 EUV systems. We currently expect to ship 6 systems in Q4, including 1 EUV system to a collaborative research center, imec, which will not be recorded in revenue but will be used to settle R&D services from imec. Q4 will be our highest EUV shipment quarter to date, bringing the total to 18 systems in 2018. Due to a combination of end-of-year production challenges and customer readiness, we now expect a couple of the originally planned 2018 ship -- systems to ship in early 2019. We expect the EUV order flow to continue next quarter in which -- that we will basically have our 30 systems planned for 2019 covered by purchase orders by the end of this year. We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management revenue to be similar to last quarter at around EUR 700 million. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 48%. Taking Q4 guidance into account, gross margin for the full year would be around 47%, which is a step-up from last year's 45% gross margin. This reflects the strength of our Deep UV and Applications business as well as continued progress in EUV profitability. The higher R&D expenses for Q4 of about EUR 420 million are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400C road map and the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 135 million. We remain excited about 2018 as the customers' demand for our products continues to be strong. We look forward to delivering another record year with continued strong growth in both sales and profitability. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had another good quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be even stronger. With the current guidance, we expect that our sales for the year will be close to EUR 11 billion and that our profitability will improve over last year. Now we continue to see strong demand for our products in both logic and memory as witnessed by our strong order book. Logic customers continue to ramp the 10-nanometer node and are also starting to ramp 7-nanometer. As customers prepare the ramp of the 7-nanometer node, it's -- it not only drives EUV demand but also drives significant demand of increase for EUV. In DRAM, customers are continuing with technology migrations as well as adding wafer capacity additions to meet bit demand growth, evidenced by our strong third quarter order intake for memory. Now we believe that the limited number of wafer capacity additions by a limited number of customers combined with a healthy demand for DRAM bits should not lead to a structural overcapacity in this industry segment. In NAND, significant 2D to 3D conversions have taken place next to investments in several greenfield fabs. This is likely creating a period of some digestion as we mentioned in prior quarters. With regards to China, we continue to see strong demand for a broad suite of our products. The China region has delivered around 20% of our sales this year, is on track to set another record revenue number. This is driven by both multinational customers as well as domestic China customers. And all 5 domestic customers that we discussed in prior quarters, at least -- so far with capacity in place now and are looking to begin the ramping next year. We believe this region presents a significant growth opportunity under the assumption that these ramps of the domestic customers are successful and that more domestic customers will follow through with their investment plans. On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make good progress. We have multiple NXE:3400C systems at customer sites that are running at 125 wafers per hour or higher and are ready for high-volume manufacturing. Availability is progressing in support of customer volume ramp with a clear focus on machine consistency. The overall progress has led to the decision to accelerate our EUV road map. And we are, as a result of this, now planning the introduction of our next-generation 0.33 NA EUV system called the NXE:3400C in the second half of 2019. This system will deliver productivity of over 155 wafers per hour. But we will talk more about the performance specifications and the road map during our Investor Day next month. As Roger mentioned, we continue to increase our shipments per quarter and plan to ship 6 systems in Q4, bringing the total to 18 systems in 2018. As we mentioned in earlier calls, this year our production output is heavily back-end loaded, which has led to some production output challenges, combined with customer fab readiness logistics. We now plan to ship a couple of systems originally planned in 2018 now in early 2019. Our shipment plan for 2019 remains at 30 systems as we now have an increased mix of the NXE:3400C systems in the second half of 2019, which will enable a significantly higher wafer output capability in the earlier specified 125 wafers per hour. With this higher productivity, we expect that we'll be able to meet our customers' current EUV capacity plans in 2019. And as Roger mentioned, we expect order flow to continue next quarter, expect to have our 2019 demand for EUV will be covered by orders by the end of the year. In Deep UV, on the introduction of the NXT:2000 system into the market is making significant progress and will be used in volume manufacturing for both memory and logic. We're also seeing significant demand for our dry products in support of a number of greenfield fab ramps in China and other regions. In our application business, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products, notably related to the adoption of our YieldStar 375 system expanding from logic and DRAM now also into 3D NAND manufacturing. To summarize 2018, we expect the growth to continue from Q3 to Q4 to set us up for another record year in both sales and profitability. Now regarding 2019, it's a bit too early to provide detailed guidance, but I will provide some qualitative comments regarding our initial views. We continue to see strong demand for our products in both memory and logic in support of our bookings, and DEEP UV demand continues to be healthy in memory, as discussed earlier. And we expect DEEP UV demand in logic to further strengthen in 2019, driven by the 10- and 7-nanometer ramps. Furthermore, we expect continued growth for our applications business with the expansion of both metrology as well as software products. EUV demand continues to be driven by logic, but also with the clear opportunity in DRAM that we meet our availability and productivity targets. EUV revenue growth is expected from both the significant increase in new shipments as well as a higher ASP of the NXE:3400C, which shipments are planned starting, as we said earlier, the second half of 2019.Furthermore, we expect customers to take advantage of system performance upgrades of their installed base to maximize capital efficiency. Our current view of the overall business next year remains positive. We expect the first half to be somewhat similar to the second half of this year, with business strengthening in the second half 2019. Our installed base will continue to grow, driving increased service revenue. Furthermore, we expect customers to take advantage of system performance upgrades of our installed base to maximize capital efficiency. Now putting this all together, we expect another year with good growth opportunity. I think we're well on track to achieve our 2020 targets. We have a significant growth potential beyond 2020, and we plan to communicate the size and the extent of this growth opportunity through 2025 in our Investor Day, which we will hold on November 8 this year.And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, can we have your final instructions and then the first question, please. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Sreekrish Sankar. Hello. can you hear me? Yes. Loud and clear. Two of them. First one, Peter, looks like your demand from your memory customers has been very strong so far. And you also -- both in terms of bookings and sales and you're also guiding to have strength into 2019. Just want to know, can you tell what's been going on in the memory industry with NAND, pricing, business and potential CapEx, plus in NAND and DRAM? And how do you confirm that your numbers, and where do you see the strength in 2019? Is it going to be DRAM or NAND in the first half? And then I have a follow-up. Okay. Well, I think you're all throwing memory into one big heap. But it is, of course, you need to separate, as you indicated, between NAND and DRAM. So let me talk about those separately. On DRAM, we haven't see CapEx [ crest ]. We have seen, in this year, some pushouts but also pull-ins for different customers. So it's -- you could argue it's customer-specific, but we haven't really seen a change in the DRAM memory demand for our products this year. And we don't see it also in 2019. Now we all seem to forget recent history, so let me talk about DRAM, yes, to put it all into perspective. Up to -- including 2016, there has been a significant conversion of DRAM into 3D NAND, which resulted in reduced DRAM capacity, which actually also led to a reduced DRAM memory spend of about 30% in litho and also a 10% to 50% reduction in the wafer capacity at our own customers. Now in 2017 and '18, customers have been working to recover this wafer capacity and to increase the bit supplies. The bit demand also was higher than anticipated. So this required and needed a much higher litho spend per unit in growth. And it's due to a combination of increasing litho intensity at these new nodes due to, say, increasing number of critical layers, which includes double patterning now and the smaller of the shrink road map, which actually means you don't get the bits -- the same number of bits through shrink, that you get less, both leading to higher wafer capacity additions to --made this 20% to 25% demand in bit growth. So this is what we have seen. So in that context, the high investments in DRAM from our customers is not a surprise and is also what we are seeing in 2019. Now on 3D NAND, over the last several years, all the 2D to 3D conversions have taken place. That actually happened. And those were very significant. Now we have not participated in a lesser litho supply because we basically use the same litho and next to that were investments in greenfield fabs. And if you add those 2 together, is the 3D conversions and then the greenfield fabs. And that has indeed lapsed to a level of capacity. And don't forget, these are big fabs, so they're step-ups in capacity. With that created weakness of the 3D NAND pricing, which we've all witnessed. That is the digestion that we go through as we speak. And what you call -- and especially if you look at the number of greenfield fabs that have been opened and the capacity, the wafer capacity that's been added to the industry, it's quite normal. Don't forget that the growth range of 3D NAND are particularly good at 40% plus. So I think this is how we look at the market. And this is why I also think that it's not a big surprise that our customers are still significantly spending on increased -- in wafer capacity both for DRAM. And to a lesser extent, today, 3D NAND. Got it. Got it. Peter, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. If I look at your commentary on calendar first half '19 from the second half of this year and strengthening the second half of next year, the fact that DUV should be strong in memory and further in logic. Is it fair to assume that DUV units next year should be higher than this year? Well, I think the DUV units will be at least at the same level as this year, whereby I think the mix, which was this year, will be skewed towards memory, will probably skew a bit more towards [ budget ], although it's too early to say which part of the industry sector is going to be the largest. But in Deep UV, I think we'll see at least the same number of Deep UV shipments and sales in 2019 as in 2018. The next question comes from Mr. David Mulholland. It's David from UBS. Just combing through the comments you made on EUV and good to see the progress on the 3400C. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. Firstly, of the bookings that you've seen in the quarter for EUV, are those still the 3400B? Or are you now booking the 3400C? And then as we look into 2020, I want a few comments just on what impact and the way that this is potentially slightly dampening the number of tools needed in H2 '19, what they might mean on 2020. Obviously, we have assumed that some of that's made back on pricing. But where do you end up in kind of revenue expectations for 2020 from EUV as you kind of net those 2 higher productive systems for potentially higher value? Okay. Good. Well, I think everything we are booking is 3400C. I mean, we're not taking any orders for Bs because the only thing we will sell as of the middle of next year is Cs. And yes, there will be a higher potential productivity coming out of these systems, which of course will have an impact on the number of systems that customers potentially want if they look at their wafer capacity that they are planning for. Now having said that, there's also a flip side for higher productivity and higher rev time, which is cost. Cost is actually going down in these higher productivity tools. It actually means that it opens -- that's also a possibility to add one, in logic more or less; and two, in memory DRAM to start using EUV in DRAM. Generally, you could say if you have more than 2,000 wafers per day productivity on a DRAM system, it becomes attractive at -- to basically start using EUV for several layers in DRAM. And that will drive the 2020 number. So -- and what's important for us is that we execute that's why we pulled the R&D in because we want the 3400C ASAP because it will, one, as you indicated, provide us with a higher value; and two, it will also provide a higher value, i.e., lower cost to our customers, which will drive the demand for EUV, which means that we still stick to our production capacity of 40 units in 2020. And I think the final 2020 number will be a function of our successful introduction of the productivity and the availability metrics that we have currently in our targets. Maybe one just quick follow-up. You haven't commented as directly in numbers in terms of the progress and availability for EUV. Obviously, it seems like you're saying it's at the level you need for insertion with customers. But in the last quarter, you were saying you had to get to over 90%. Can you quantify where you are? And where you're heading? Yes. Yes. I think we're -- as we said, we want to have a target of 88% availability by the end of the year. This is where we're heading to. I think with the 3400C, we will go over 90%. I think -- and we have a target of 92%. I think what I said earlier, we need that 90% threshold. That's what we said in earlier calls. It is our opinion today that with the current availability targets, customers will use EUV in HEM. And it's very simple -- in logic, it's very simple because without EUV -- and I just refer to comments that was made by some of our customers, without EUV, it simply won't work. And that it's so much of a 7-nanometer demand or -- if you want or 7-plus and/or a 5-nanometer demand that you cannot escape using EUV. They will use EUV at 88%. We'd love it to be higher. And it will be higher, but that is not a make-or-break number. The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse. I guess the question, if I could go back to your 2019 outlook for DUV. It sounds like you're now saying kind of first half similar to second half and already growth into the second half of '19. And just curious, is that a changed statement from your views 3, 6 months ago? And if so, what has changed, I guess, vis-à-vis DRAM contribution, advanced logic in China? Well, I think it has not changed. I think it's going to -- one, we haven't qualitatively guided any trend for 2019 until today. So I think this is the first time. But for that, internally, of course, we have this outlook. I don't think it has changed that much. Absolutely not. And in China, nothing changed in the sense that what Chinese customers were planning, let's say, this time a year ago on 2019, they're actually executing on. So you could argue that their execution of their first lines and their pilot lines have actually gone well. So I think it's -- there's no change. I think it was -- no significant change, nor in memory nor in logic. Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, can you talk to how you're expecting linearity of shipments for the 30 EUV tools in 2019? And how we should think about the progression of gross margins in that same time frame? Yes. The linearity is what you would expect with a ramp. I mean, this year, we -- and if you look at the quarter, we do 3, 4, 5, 6. And I think this is the kind of linearity that you would also expect next year whereby the 3400C, of course, is the model that customers would really like. So you would clearly see also the second half will be the -- demands for that product going up. Now on the -- Roger, on -- your turn. On gross margin, I think we have articulated a target of 40% there for 2020. I think we're on track to get there and I think, as we've mentioned before, 4 levers to get there. The first lever, obviously, is ASP, higher ASP, which is to a very large extent, correlated with the productivity and the throughput of the machine. So that's a major driver of the gross margin. Second, volume. Fixed cost coverage obviously increases to the extent that volume of the ramps. Third, learning curve. And we're already experiencing that, and we continue to experience that into the next couple of years. And fourth, service. Service revenue and service margin will go up as well. And the combination of those 4 levers, we believe, gets us to the 40% target that we've articulated before for 2020. The next question comes from Mr. Mitch Steves. Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had a quick question on EUV. So basically, because you guys are off by about 2 units here in 2020 -- I'm sorry, 2018, you guys are still reguiding to 30. Is the 40 units still the right number for 2020? And then second, I guess why doesn't the '19 number go up by 2 units? Yes. I'm going to answer your last question. We're introducing, by the middle of the year, the 3400C, which has a productivity, which is over 155 wafers per hour, which is a significant improvement in terms of productivity, which means that customers are not planning systems. They are planning wafers. So when you get more wafers out of a machine, then you might potentially use less machines. So that's why the 30 unit is still good when we -- and it's not more than that. You could argue that the 2 units are then cannibalized by the higher productivity of the 3400C. Okay. I mean, that's good because the 3400C is also a higher-value tool, we'll just price it higher. So from a sales point of view, I think it's a good progression. Of the 40 units -- I said it earlier in the previous answer, I think the 40 units is the capacity that we have. I think that is -- whether we will sell it all is really a function of the success with which we're going to introduce the 3400C, and we're able to start running up the availability of the machine over to 90%. That will drive down costs for our customers significantly. And cost is the main driver for our customers to buy tools, yes? And I think the opportunity here is in the memory space, in the DRAM space. And also somewhat in the logic space because there you can add a few more layers to EUV because the cost is just better. And in DRAM, like I said, if we order 2,000 wafers per day, we come in the real where customers are really seeing the economic benefits of EUV application in DRAM. So for this capacity, let's go after it by executing on our 3400C program. The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. It's Andrew from Barclays. I just got a few more quick ones on the EUV program. Firstly, Peter, you just mentioned it briefly there again, the question of layer count within logic. If I go back to this time last year, we were talking about 10 layers at the 7-nanometer node. To your point, the improved productivity and specs on the 3400C suggest it's going to be higher than that. Can you give us any initial indication from your customers as to how much higher the layer count may be relative to that initial number of 10? Yes. I think it's really different numbers. But again, like I said earlier, I assume a successful execution of our 3400C specification targets. And you could look at anywhere between 12 and 14. Okay. And then just as quick follow-ups on EUV. Can you give us some idea of mix between logic and memory in the 30-tool shipments next year? Clearly, again, if I go back a couple of quarters, logic was going to dominate but just sounding a bit more optimistic about DRAM demand. And also last one for Roger. Is there going to be any EUV deferred revenue left to recognize in 2019? Or is the rev rec next year purely on the 30-tool shipments? Yes. On -- I think the mix is predominantly logic. But like I said, there is an opportunity there. And of course, throughout 2019, when we see the first module results, the test results of the critical modules of the 3400C, we can probably engage with our customers at that time, the memory customers, who will see whether they would like an increased number of memory tools. That is an opportunity, I would say, but it's predominantly logic. In terms of revenue recognition, as you know, at this stage, the systems revenue gets recognized upon shipment. And that will obviously continue for this model into 2019. The interaction of 3400C at this stage, again, we believe that we will recognize the revenue at shipment at this stage. The next question comes from Mr. Alex Duval. Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just a quick one on logic spending in 2019. You obviously talked about most memory and logic spending remaining on high levels in 2019. But you talked about DUV logic actually being up even though revenues were already on a high level. So I wondered if you could just talk about what the key swing factors are that are driving that? And as a brief follow-up, you talked about the 2H weighted year for your overall group revenues in 2019. And you just talked about a flattish half-on-half growth rate in the first half. So how should we be thinking about the step-up into the second half? What is the key reason for that step-up? And are we talking low single-digits growth half-on-half or something of great magnitude? Okay. The logic spending in 2019 is up. But don't forget that means the majority of the spend this year was in memory. And logic will be ramping 10-nanometer in macro processes and 7-nanometer in the foundry space. And that's happening because the -- when we listened to the customers, the tape outs are there, customer orders are there. Now that will happen, and that will increase. Now like I said earlier, that's why I think that the Deep UV business for 2019 will be at least as good as in 2018. But by -- a little bit more skewed towards logic. And it's driven by 7- and 10-nanometer. Now on the half-on-half, I said in earlier answer that our view as to 2019 and the, let's say, the shipment levels in the first half, second half haven't changed that much from where we were 1 or 2 quarters ago. But effectively means that our customer plans, which is a result also of when their fabs are ready, when can they take the tools, yes, that hasn't changed that much. So I would say that half-on-half is more a function of when the customers need the tools. So when do they ramp what? Then that's the main reason. So there's nothing magical behind it. There's no reason why there would be this particular cyclicality, if you want to call it this way. Yes? No, I think it's just the way how customers plan. And this means that the first half of 2019 will be somewhat the same as the second half of 2018, which was a pretty good half. So -- and any accelerations, you will see in the second half also at the EUV numbers will go up, yes. And the 3400C will be there, but also the second half skewed. So that's probably the only answer I can give. The next question comes from Mr. Stephane Houri. This is Stephane Houri from ODDO BHF. Actually, I have a question about the OpEx side because we saw a -- really, an increase in R&D. And as you said, it's DRAM tool and your EUV tool. But the pace is accelerating throughout the year. We are now up 26% year-on-year on R&D. Where do we go? And how do we model it for 2019? I think we've said before also on the Q2 call, I think we've mentioned that we believe in the short term, there will be an uptick in R&D. And that uptick is to a very large extent or is uniquely related to 2 things. It's the acceleration of the 0.33 EUV road map, as we mentioned before, the 3400C; and also the High-NA program acceleration. So that's why we said midterm, we expect that -- so we've said short term that will lead to an uptick of the numbers. We also said that medium term, we expect that to go back to the model that you've seen before and that we've given to you for 2020, which is 13%. Sales. Yes. Sales. All right. And the follow-up is about metrology and inspection. You had a very good quarter this quarter. Is it a trend that we should push forward? Or is there -- was there anything special this quarter? No. I think it's just a trend that metrology and inspection will become more important that there's a couple of drivers there. I think the introduction of YieldStar 375 is a metrology system that is now not only being used in logic and in DRAM but now also is introduced into 3D NAND with very clear involvement just for our customers. On top of that, we see good growth, very clear growth in HMI in the e-beam business. We're planning to ship the first 3x3 multi-beam tool in 2019. That will also help the top line. And there's a whole suite of software products that we're helping our customers deal with the complexities and intricacies of 7-nanometer and the 5-nanometer development nodes. So there's a whole suite of products that are actually helping our customers to basically deal with the increased cost of the NXT nodes. And that's particularly helpful when you look at our metrology and inspection business. So it's a trend. Next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Peter, I just want to go back to your comment about 2019, first half of '19 versus second half. And I appreciate the details and still the same view as a couple of quarters ago. I'm just wondering, does that reflect the finalized CapEx plans by your key customers? Or if there's a change to those CapEx plans related this year or early next year that could either -- something that could have an impact on your view that has not yet materialized? Mehdi, what you're asking me is look at my crystal ball what the customer CapEx plans are going to be going forward. I don't know. I mean, if they -- if they're going to change, they're going to change. But there's nothing today that leads us to believe that they're going to do that. Yes. When you look at their plans, it's about technology transition in logic. Trust me, it's going to happen, yes? If you now look at the DRAM expansion plans -- we have a limited number of customers, only 3, and 2 of them have some capacity expansion plans where the fabs are being built. And you're long enough into this industry to understand that once you have the DRAM structure there, you're going to fill it up because it's the only way to cover your fixed cost is to bring out as many DRAM business you can in this new fab. So these are all plans that are really cost installed, yes? And whether they are going to cut or to slow down that ramp, I don't know. But the current plans are what they are, which means that the shipments that we're seeing in H1 and H2 that's been planned for some time now, they're still valid. And what changes in the future, I don't know. Sure. Thanks for the sincerity and the fact that your customer mix has increasingly consolidated does make it more challenging to forecast. Just moving on... Or it makes it easier. Yes. Or your -- it's easier for you because your crystal ball is better than mine. That's absolutely true. Right. One thing with EUV, I'm just very intrigued. We started the year with a commentary that you could ship 22. You see now it's down to 18. I appreciate the improved throughput with the 3400C coming out second half of next year. But on the flip side, your customer mix has also consolidated. One of the key foundries is no longer pursuing leading edge. And the leading foundry is now the leading semiconductor manufacturer, and they're well ahead of others. And perhaps the DRAM industry is waiting for 3400C before they finalize their plans. And I'm just trying to better understand, when we dial in the 30-unit system into our expectation and 40 into 2020, what are the key wafer capacity targets that you're looking at? You -- in the past, you've talked about certain foundry capacity for leading edge. Is there any metric that you could provide us so that we could have a more realistic set of expectation and if there is a change we know what are the key parameters that have changed? Okay. Well, I think the more realistic expectation is the expectation that I gave you. Because I think it is realistic, yes? And it has to do with the fact that yes, our customer base is consolidating, which in itself, generally leads to a better capital efficiency in the industry because every customer plans for winning business. And if you have multiple customers all planning for the same business that -- yes, that might be a reason or that might be a very good reason why you ship a few more systems. Now in this particular case, it's not the case because like you said, there's 1 -- a customer has stepped out of 7-nanometer from the foundries. And that base is now close to Taiwan. But -- and the real question is, as you know, if that's a 7 plus or a 5-nanometer-type business, yes, what is the size of that 7-plus and 5-nanometer business for that customer? And that is significant. I can only repeat what the CEO of that company said a couple of times. 7-nanometer, 7-plus and 5 is going to be big. And that's based on what their customers are telling them what they need in terms of wafer capacity. Since they're the only one really in that space -- and we're not going to tell you anything about the plant wafer, capacity, you should ask them. That's not my role. But I can tell you that this is a big driver for the 2019 EUV shipments, yes? And that's only for the foundry business. On top of that, you have the micro processes and you have the first start of some 5 production on DRAM. If you add it all up, you see those plans and you see the road maps, then the 30 number we think is a realistic number. Now if there's some upside, hey, if the 3400C turns out to be -- is a very good tool and we'll figure it out in, of course, 2019 given our module testing in all level and ways, can we -- could we output 1 or 2 or 3 more eventually, but then let the customers decide, and I would think it's going to be in logic, that upside would probably be in memory and in DRAM. So that's the situation today, and we're giving you clear guidance on the 30 units. That's really based on a realistic scenario as presented to us by our customers. The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. JP Morgan. Peter, my question is, I mean, I'm trying to understand what you've been saying about 2019. Clearly, EUV is up to 30 tools is what you're guiding. Your metrology business is growing into next year. Your Installed Base Management business is growing into next year. So I don't think there are questions about that. So the question is about the DUV business. I mean, from what I'm hearing you're saying into -- in response to earlier questions that you're looking for a flattish trend. And I mean that is dominated by the growth in logic and memory not that strong. But I mean, you still have a flattish trend in DUV next year. I mean, I think everybody's estimates for your -- on revenue for ASML are wrong. Well, it's not my responsibility to come up with an estimate. But what I said at least means I see a bottom for our Deep UV business to be at least the same, yes? Now Deep UV business has a lead time that is a bit shorter, so there are changes from time to time. So customers could still change for this second memory to -- of 2019 to go up. And I just called a bottom, which actually means that there could be upside. And yes, and I would not be surprised if there would be. But how big that upside would be? I don't know. So that is a bit where I have to stay qualitative and cannot speak quantitative. Yes? Because, I mean, I'm just looking at the consensus ahead of today. The market is looking at about 7% revenue growth for ASML. So are you suggesting -- because we know approximately from the other 3 line items where your growth would be for 2019. But if you have flat DUV, we are looking at well into double-digit growth. So would you say that you should -- you can potentially grow well into the double digits into 2019? I think you've done the math for us. The next question comes from Mr. John Pitzer. Yes. It's Credit Suisse. Peter, you mentioned in your prepared comments that China's going to end up being about 20% of business in calendar year '18. What's domestic China going to be this year? And as you look out to your '19 forecast, is China domestic a breakout year in '19? Or is it more in line with trend line growth? Well, I think what I said in my prepared comments that 5 of those domestic customers are now planning to ramp in 2019, which actually means that we see our business in 2019 from China also growing. Now beyond that, I think everything -- and I said it also in the prepared comments, how big the growth will be also depends on how successful all those ramps are going to be because the first pilot lines have been installed and they're actually executing on their 2019 ramp plans. But as we all know, some of these companies are greenfield companies. Are they all going to be as successful? We don't know. But if they would be, and they're executing on their plans as we currently see it, then our business in China will be up next year. And then Peter, my second question is just managing through the transition on EUV as you bring out these higher-NA more productive tools. You mentioned in an earlier question that you thought about few tools next year got cannibalized on productivity. The 30 new EUV tools you have, what's it -- potentially at risk for further cannibalization? Can customers future-proof? Can you upgrade an EUV tool to a higher NA once you've installed it? Or is that not an option? And to the extent that, that 30 number does get cannibalized, should that just upside our 2020 number for you guys? No. I think the -- you cannot upgrade to higher NA. The higher NA, the High-NA EUV tool is a completely different tool, different dimension, so it doesn't work. But that you can upgrade from actually a 3350 to a 3400 if you would like to do that. That is a big open heart surgery in the field. We -- that could happen in 2020. We see some of those upgrades. But I certainly would say that there is not much downside to further cannibalization than what we just said. I think there is some upside if the 3400C turns out to be quicker meeting the performance targets, then we could -- we were in if 1 or 2 or 3 more systems in 2019 going into 2020 as a start for higher adoption in the DRAM market. But still, it's too early to speculate any further beyond the 30 units. I would certainly not speculate down. I wouldn't speculate up yet. But if there is a chance for a change, I would say, it depends on the performance of the C, especially all of those have the possibility in the DRAM space. The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani. Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. I really wanted to just circle back on a broader topic, Peter, if I could. Let's just first talk about the trade wars that's going on right now and potential implications for supply chain. Could you maybe give us a sense of if you have done any assessment that you are likely to be impacted by the second tranche of tariffs? And if you see any need within your own supply chain to make any changes based on what's already been made public today. Then I have a follow-up. We're going to be pretty short on this. We don't see any significant impact. Not for our business, not for our supply chain either. Okay. And secondly, in terms of just us without trying to belabor too much on the point for the 30 tools. So you said that the capacity would be 30 tools, and then of course it depends on the output for the 3400C. So would it be fair to assume that in terms of the production output or the demand that your customers are seeing out there right now, it's as strong as it was 3 months ago? If anything, it has gotten even stronger, which is why you were saying there's more likelihood of numbers being up than down. Would that be a fair assessment to make? Yes. At first, there's a little correction, Amit. Yes, the capacity is indeed around 30 systems. Now if you add the 2 so you could do a 32. But what we're saying, we are shipping 30, which includes the 2 that they are shifting from 2018 because the wafer capacity that customers are needing that only because we have a higher productivity tool that -- yes, then that mean they need 30 units, 28 plus 2, yes? So it's driven by the higher wafer capacity output that's coming out of the 3400C. Now that actually means that there could be, from a manufacturing point of view, there's a few 1 or 2 or 3 upside that now would only materialize if we get our customers convinced that productivity of our EUV in 3400C number is also -- is good enough and is reliable enough to put them into an earlier production for memory, for DRAM in this space. So I said it a couple of times. I hope it's clear now. So that -- this is why I said I don't think from a demand point of view that there is a big change. What we said before is that when we looked at the overall demand for EUV, we did include, for instance, customers like GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which of course have fallen off. That could have driven the demand over 30 units. Now they're not there anymore. That is consolidated into one other customer. So that's the only thing that probably changed. It's the consolidation in the industry, but it doesn't have an effect on our shipment plan. And then just if I could very quickly ask, have you -- because you talked about the productivity of the 3400C, have you decided what level of markup in price with your -- price for 3400C over the 3400B? Or is that still to be fixed? Yes. That is still to be fixed. We are talking to a few customers on that final pricing. So let's not do the price negotiation over this conference call. We'll do that when we have this -- in the -- in the private rooms of the customers. The next question comes from Ms. Tammy Qiu. Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. The first one is, Peter, you mentioned that next year, Deep UV spending is mainly skewed towards the logic foundry side. I'm just wondering because when logic foundry make a like TSMC move into a new generation, their reuses percentage can be as high as 95%. I'm just wondering to what extent you're actually reflecting high reusage in your estimation. And also, at the same time, would you say in your backlog of EUV shipment, has anyone already got full allocation of tools for ramping up next-generation 7-nanometer plus equivalent? Or they are still ordering for that generation? And I have a short follow-up. I think for anything, we don't use N7 this, let's say, 7-nanometer or N7. There are still orders that we'll be taking. So that's now easy. Reuse, you have to define reuse. What customers are mentioning when they talk about their reuse is that the existing installed base can be reused for the next node, yes? The next node needs more capacity. So what we're looking at for next year for logic is through capacity additions, extra wafers out. And when I said 2019, I didn't say it was mainly skewed towards logic. I said logic is going to increase in terms of its share in the Deep UV shipment as compared to 2018, yes? Memory is still going to be strong, but logic is also going to be a higher component of Deep UV shipments than it was in 2018. Okay. And also, you mentioned last quarter that you are accelerating your R&D process for High-NA. I'm just wondering, has your accelerated R&D been impacting a number of layers EUV can be used by the time of High-NA is available? Yes. Sorry, could you repeat 2? So basically, last quarter, you have been accelerating your R&D process for High-NA EUV tool, right? So I'm just wondering, with your accelerated R&D process for High-NA, has chip makers been making decision about introducing EUV for more layers when High-NA is available because it's available... Oh, okay, okay. Sorry. Yes. I think what you will see going forward is that High-NA will be introduced in high-volume manufacturing by the middle of the next decade. Then you will see a very clear mix of 0.33, you can say, low-NA layers and the use of High-NA layers. They're going to be used next to each other. So High-NA is now going to cannibalize that much of the low NA, but they're going to address the additional critical layers of the N3 and the N2 nodes. So this is how it actually works. So yes, on EUV, if you think about EUV in total, of course, there will be more layers allocated to EUV in a combination of low NA and High-NA. The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku. It's Adi Metuku from Bank of America. I have 2 questions. Firstly, a clarification on the OpEx. So obviously, your OpEx is ramping up a lot into 4Q. And when we look at the run rate, quarterly run rate for 2019, should we assume that the 4Q run rate would be a reasonable number? Or do you think that'll start to trickle down as we go through 2019? And secondly, just looking at 5-nanometer demand and how the ecosystem is developing. I wondered if Peter, if you could comment a bit on how the ecosystem is progressing, especially from a pellicle and inspection tool viewpoint. Yes. I can take the last question and Roger can take your first question. On the 5-nanometer development, that, if anything, is accelerating. And I think the issue with pellicle is a function of the effectivity, yes? So it's a -- the effectivity numbers and the effectivity control is increasing significantly. So we have made a lot of progress this year together with our customers on the effectivity control. And I think on the 5-nanometer node, the current use or the use of the current pellicles and the effectivity measures are sufficient to support 5-nanometer. That's what we believe. At 3-nanometer, which is a couple of years beyond that, we might want to look into whether we need additional inspection tools. That is really depending on how successful we are in the effectivity control at the 7-plus and the 5-nanometer node, which looks to be very good. So whether we need that inspection tool going forward is still a question that needs to be answered, then perhaps it's negative that we don't need it, that it depends on the progress that we will make on the effectivity with the current generations. That's right. So CapEx, it's, in essence, the same logic as we had for R&D, which is over time and particularly when you talk about acceleration that you can see a bit of an uptick. And you won't be surprised that CapEx, to a certain extent, correlates with R&D. So with R&D going up, there is logic that certain CapEx goes up as well. So that will go hand-in-hand and that's something that we see in the short term. Medium term and long term, you will once again see that's -- it models back to what we presented to you in our 2020 model, which is 4% of CapEx, 4% of sales would be assumed in the CapEx. Sorry, Roger, apologies for the CapEx. I meant OpEx. So when I look at 4Q '18, OpEx as a proportion of revenues, obviously, when I take your guidance, it's -- you're seeing a pretty strong uptake. And it's -- and the OpEx run rate is significantly higher than what consensus modeling for 2019. So I just wondered, you made a comment earlier on OpEx picking up short term, but coming down medium term. So as we go through 2019, should that -- when should we expect that uptick to come down? When should we expect that downtick? That's the question. You can expect that downtick, and that's going back to the model that we presented to you, in the course of 2019 -- early in 2019. So there are reasons for SG&A, in particular, because I think we need to distinguish here between SG&A and R&D. I mentioned to you R&D as it relates to SG&A, we see a bit of an uptick in what we expect for Q4. You will see that come down to the 4% model that we guided for -- in the course of 2019. And a lot of that -- yes, I think you already answered it because as you know, we are driving the High-NA introduction and the 3400C, which will mean that we see an elevated level of R&D spending in 2019, which would actually -- would give a very clear indication in Q4 of what the levels could be. But medium term, that will come down again. And where will that be? I think somewhere in the 2020, 2021 time frame, you will see that because that's when the peak of the High-NA program will have happened, yes? And because I -- we are going to -- we're planning to ship High-NA starting 2022. So end of 2021, beginning of 2022. So that peak will be for the next 2 years, and then it will level off. All right.

Thank you, Skip. Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and 2018 annual results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q4 and full year financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. Roger, if you will? Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2019. Q4 net sales came in at EUR 3.14 billion, slightly higher than our guidance. Net system sales of EUR 2.42 billion was more weighted towards Logic at 60% with the remaining 40% from Memory. We shipped 6 EUV systems and recognized EUV revenue of EUR 579 million from 5 shipments. 1 system was shipped to collaborative research center Imec, was not recorded as revenue, which we mentioned last quarter. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 719 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, which was negatively impacted by the Nikon settlement. Without this charge, the gross margin was 48.5%. We signed a memorandum of understanding with Nikon to settle our legal disputes over the alleged patent infringements that was initiated by Nikon. Therefore, we recorded a provision in our 2018 accounts, which has a negative impact of EUR 131 million on gross margin in 2018. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses came in a little higher than guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 442 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 135 million.Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 345 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. This leaves around EUR 1.35 billion of the 2018-2019 share buyback remaining. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.03 billion, which was higher than expected due to early payments by multiple customers at the end of the year.Moving to the order book. Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 1.59 billion. Logic order intake was 80% of total value with the remaining 20% from Memory. We took 5 new EUV orders in the quarter. For the full year, our net sales grew 22% to a record of EUR 10.9 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales was similar to last year at EUR 2.68 billion. We shipped 18 EUV systems with a total EUV system sale of EUR 1.9 billion, representing a significant growth over 2017. Our gross margin for 2018 was 46%, which would have been 47.2% without the Nikon settlement charges. We made considerable improvements on our gross margin in 2018 and remain on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020 as confirmed during our Investor Day in November last year.We continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increased R&D from EUR 1.26 billion in 2017 to EUR 1.58 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2018 revenue was about 14% and SG&A was about 5 -- 4.5% of revenue, both similar to 2017 as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the full year grew 25% to a record of EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 23.7% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.10. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2019. We expect Q1 total net sales of about EUR 2.1 billion. The lower revenue guidance is due to a combination of revenue pull into Q4 2018 as well as a reduction in shipments due to a fire at one of our suppliers, Prodrive, and some system demand change. As announced in a press release on December 3 last year, there was a fire at one of our suppliers of electronics components and modules. This resulted in a loss of work in progress as well as some inventory. Due to the integral cycle time of about 1 quarter for these modules, our first quarter sales will be negatively affected -- impacted by around EUR 300 million, which we expect to largely recover in Q2. We expect the remainder to be recovered in the second half. Our total net sales forecast for Q1 includes around EUR 300 million of EUV system revenue. We currently expect to ship 3 EUV systems in Q1. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 600 million, which is primarily due to lower field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be around 40%. The lower gross margin is due to a combination of mix, lower field upgrades, factory loading and EUV service burden. The mix relates to a reduction in higher-margin immersion systems and field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire and some system demand change. With lower system sales, there is also a reduction in factory loading, which has a negative impact on gross margins. As our EUV installed base continues to grow, we must expand our service infrastructure to support these systems in the field, which is an increased burden on gross margins until we start collecting service revenue later this year. We see the impact from these items continuing into Q2 with an expected recovery in second half. The positive margin recovery in the second half will be driven by higher revenue, does improve factory loading as well as increased field upgrades, and we will start shipping the higher-margin NXE:3400C, in addition to realizing EUV service revenue. We expect to move towards our 2020 target of over 50% gross margin as we exit the year.The higher R&D expenses for Q1, around EUR 480 million, are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400 road map and growing investments in the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 130 million, which is similar to prior quarter. Although we are currently going through a period of uncertainty in the industry, we look forward to a growth opportunity in 2019. As we remain confident in our long-term growth, we will propose a 50% increase in our dividends to EUR 2.10 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 24 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 880 million. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had another good quarter, closing a great year for us with a record demand from our memory and logic customers combined across our entire product portfolio. While the current geopolitical landscape and economic environments are creating volatility in the markets and uncertainty on the near term, as mentioned before, we still expect overall growth in 2019. At the very end of last year, we saw the continued slowdown of memory end market demand as well as some demand reduction in the logic end markets primarily driven by the mobile and the server markets. And this translated into pushouts of our planned systems to both memory and logic customers from the first half 2019 in their attempt to regain balance of supply against demand. The net market, as mentioned today -- in prior quarters, remains in an overbuy situation -- oversupply situation and is going through a digestion phase after a period of significant 2D to 3D conversions, yield improvements and wafer capacity additions. DRAM is experiencing softening of bit demand, largely driven by decreased demand in mobile market as well as some inventory correction in the server market. All this has resulted in some pushouts of planned shipments by memory customers in the first half of 2019. Customers have indicated that they believe there will be a recovery the second half of the year, and they expect that inventory levels will be managed down swiftly. In Logic, while we see some softening in Deep UV demand, which is primarily driven by the mobile market, we still expect strong demand in support of the ramp of 10 and 7-nanometer nodes. We also expect to see strong growth in EUV demand, supporting the customers' ramp of 7 and 7-plus nanometer nodes as well as a transition to the 5-nanometer node. Although future developments in the macroeconomic environment can impact our current view, currently expect Logic demand to increase around 50% year-over-year and Memory to be down around [ 20% ] year-over-year. We still expect single-digit percentage growth of Installed Base revenue. In summary, 2019 will be a growth year, largely driven by Logic. On the ASML product side, we -- let me start with update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make solid progress as evident in the positive public comments from our logic and memory customers with the use of EUV in their most advanced nodes. Logic customers are installing systems in support of volume manufacturing for the 7 and 5-nanometer nodes. DRAM customers are also working on qualifying EUV with their future nodes. And this year, we expect that the first commercial EUV-enabled chip reach the consumer market. 2018, we demonstrated over 145 wafers per hour, and we are accelerating our EUV road map to deliver 170 wafers per hour with our NXE:3400C with first shipments planned in second half of 2019. NXE:3400C will also include a number of innovations that will further improve availability. As Roger mentioned, we shipped 6 systems in Q4, which translates to a total of 8 EUV shipments in 2018. With the 5 orders booked this quarter, our shipment plan of 30 systems for 2019 is covered. In Deep UV, we shipped out 189 systems in 2018, an increase of 17% over 2017, and we were able to further increase our output in support of the demand from both logic and memory customers. And we continue ramping our latest immersion system, NXT:2000 with a record time to achieve mature customer yields. Our application portfolio has continued to see strong adoption in all market segments. Our latest YieldStar system continues to gain adoption in memory customers following the strong adoption we saw in Logic. Integrated products using the combined technology of HMI and ASML are being evaluated at multiple customer sites to help improve customer yields and time to market. So to summarize 2018, our fourth quarter came in slightly above our guidance, and we nearly achieved EUR 11 billion sales for the year, which was a milestone originally set for 2020. Although 2018 was a very good year from a financial perspective, I think it was also a milestone year in terms of technology innovations across all our products. This not only provides our customers with higher value solutions, it also fuels our future growth. Turning to 2019. We currently see some uncertainty in the market, but after a long period of strong capacity investments, driven by healthy demand over the past years, it is normal to see a period of digestion, which we expect in first half of 2019. With regards to the markets we serve, our customers responded quite late in Q4, slowing demand in their end markets by delaying deliveries of litho systems for the first half of 2019 to balance supply and demand. We now see our first half of 2019 lower than the second half of 2018 with the reduction being roughly an equal split between Memory and Logic. The fundamental drivers of high-performance compute with associated high-performance memory and data storage are still in place and our customers clearly indicated the need for a strong shipment settled in the second half of 2019 in support of their 2020 business potential. The demand in the second half of 2019 will, therefore, be 50% higher than the first half of the year. For 2019, the Logic segment is expected to be the growth driver, investing strongly in technology transitions as well as production capacity with our advanced nodes. As we have consistently done in prior slowdowns, we sustained or even accelerated our investments in R&D, deliver on the leading-edge technology where the market turns up, which has been and will be the key driver to secure our long-term growth. We expect to increase our investments in R&D to EUR 1.9 billion for 2019. We reiterate that we see market demand that supports yet another growth -- supports yet another year of growth for ASML in 2019 with significantly stronger demand in the second half of the year. As Roger explained, we see similar developments in our profitability with lower margins expected in the first half of 2019, improving towards our 2020 targets of over 50% as we exit the year. Despite some uncertainty in the current environment, we remain confident about our sales and profit targets for 2020 and beyond as we communicated during our Investor Day in November last year. We're happy to underline this confidence with our proposal of a 50% increase in our dividend. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Mitch Steve. Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had to really focus on the Q1 and kind of the quarterly numbers going forward. So I understand a EUR 300 million hit from the fire, but how do I think about kind of June and then going forward to September, December in terms of sequentials? And secondly, also for the gross margin line, I think it's pretty difficult to get from 40% to kind of 50% at the exit. So any help there would also be very useful. Okay, thank you. So let me start by talking about the gross margin and the gross margin drivers, if you like, in the first quarter and then reconciling that to how we see the rest of the year. So as I mentioned in my introduction, the main drivers of gross margin in the quarter, so bringing back the gross margin from 48.5%, which is the gross margin that we had in Q4 if you adjust for Nikon and then bringing it down to the 40% that we essentially guide for Q1, the main drivers there are the loading in the factory. As we said, that is the result of obviously, lower sales level. That would account for about 1% in that bridge. The second element is the mix in DUV, and that is essentially as a result of some of the pushouts from the first quarter into essentially the second half. And that generates approximately a 2.5% impact in that bridge of the gross margin. The biggest impact on gross margin actually is from what we call the field upgrades and service, and that has 2 components to it, and I mentioned both components in my introduction. One component is the lower field upgrades. And the lower field upgrades that we expect to have in Q1 are, to a very large extent, related to the Prodrive situation because it means that there is no availability for field upgrades for certain components. So that's one element. And if we talk about the EUV's -- EUV service burden, which I mentioned in my introduction, again just to recap what we mean by that, as you know, the installed base in EUV is growing. A number of our customers are looking into high-volume manufacturing for EUV, not too long from now. That means that we have to support them, obviously, in the field to get everything up and running. While the revenue associated with the service from EUV will only kick in once wafers are being produced, which we expect to happen at the end of this year. So that means that we have a significant cost burden right now, while the revenues only kick in at the end of the year. If you take those 2 together, so the lower field upgrades and the EUV service burden, that accounts for approximately 4% in that gross margin bridge that I gave you. And then there's about 1% left, which is miscellaneous. That has a number of elements in there. So that kind of gives you the bridge from the 48.5% to the 40% that we had in Q1. Now back to your question, how is all of that going to -- how we going to recover to normal margin levels, if you like, in H2, and as I mentioned, how we going to get from this situation into the -- towards 50% gross margin that we expect as we exit 2019 into 2020. So as it relates to the mix effect and also the loading effect as a result of the uptake of the business that we expect for the second half, that is what is the main driver -- the main driver behind that. We also expect some of the field upgrades that we lost as a result of Prodrive in the first quarter. We expect some of that to be recouped in the second half of this year. Third important point in getting the margin up to that level is the shipment in the course of the second half of the 3400C model, which is the model that, as you know, has a significantly better margin profile. And then, finally, again related to what I just mentioned at the end of this year when high-volume manufacturing starts to kick in on EUV, that's where we also expect service revenue to come up. So that's essentially how we came back from 48.5% to 40%. But also, it gives you the bridge how we believe we're going to exit the year at the level of towards 50% gross margin. Yes. And Mitch, let me answer the, I'd say, the Q-on-Q sequence. Let me say half-on-half sequence. So first of all, I'd like to reiterate what I said earlier that, for the year, we expect the Logic sales to be 50% up from last year, Memory about 20% down and a single-digit growth in Installed Base Management. Now you can add it all up. And if you then come to that number, that sales number will be divided half-on-half. As such, we believe that the second half of 2019, as I said earlier, will be about 50% higher than the first. So if you take those numbers, then you can calculate the Q-on-Q, I would say, the half-on-half trend. The next question comes from Mr. Krish Sankar. Sankar from Cowen. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 of them. First one, Peter, given the DRAM outlook has incrementally worsened over the last couple of months and now you view that these tools that have been pushed out from first half into second half of the year, what kind of tangible data points that you or your customers have on a conviction in the second half shipment recovery? And is there a risk it can get pushed out further? And I also had a follow-up. Yes. I think, Krish, that is a good question. I think what our customers are actually seeing is what their customers are telling them what they need. So there's nobody there with a crystal ball that can say -- that can tell us that the second half is going to be absolutely certain at a certain level. It's simply not there. I think, therefore, the economic uncertainties are simply there, and they need to basically stabilize to give us a bit more confidence. However, having said that, the feedback we get, especially from our DRAM customers, is that -- from our largest customers, is that they said we should not underestimate their ability to react swiftly and that's what they have done. So they said, to what we are looking -- where we're looking now, that is a 20% bit growth or even slightly less this year. And then looking what they have installed in terms of capacity and their ability to react swiftly, which they have already done, they believe that, with that bit demand, they should be back into a more positive territory in the second half of this year. That's what they've told us. But again, if you're asking for absolute certainty, which somebody did during our press conference this morning, there is no absolute certainty, but it is very much related to the economic environment. But based on these data points, our customers believe that we need to be ready to start shipping again in H2. Got it, got it. Peter, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. When I look at your memory orders in Q4, it's like down almost 80% from the peak, and it's also back to like early 2016 levels. So should we expect memory bookings to rebound in calendar Q1 in the current quarter? Or do you think it's going to take a quarter or 2 before you see that happening? Well, it is what I said earlier. I think it is a swift reaction. So it's quite a significant reduction. And I think that the low memory order intake is a reflection of what the customers decided they wanted to do in Q4 with respect to the 2019 shipments. Now if they're right, on the second half of the year, we should see a rebound of those orders in the course of the year. The next question comes from Mr. David Mulholland. It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just one question, firstly, on the EUV road map. Obviously, you talked a lot about this at your Capital Markets Day and, at some point, this needing to move towards multipatterning. I think some of the comments that we've seen in some industry events were suggesting that might even be the case at kind of the 5-nanometer node or the industry 5-nanometer node. So wonder if you could maybe comment on how you see that progressing, and then I've got a follow-up. Yes. I think if you talk about the industry 5-nanometer node, which some of our customers then call the N3 node, yes, there is some discussion on this. Now I don't think we can say with 100% certainty that it's going to happen, but it's definitely something that's being considered. That's correct. And then just in terms of the follow-up. On the comment you made on China, I'm still seeing looking quite strong even after what happened on one of the customers there being banned from buying from the U.S. Have you started seeing more confirmations on orders from the likes of YMTC or Innotron at this stage? Well, I think the -- you have to make a split between the domestic and the nondomestic customers. I think some of the slowdowns that we have seen, they do relate to the nondomestic Chinese customers and effects about the Chinese fabs, but the domestic demand is still as strong as it was 1 or 2 or 3 quarters ago. I mean -- and it's understandable. If you look at what they're doing, I mean, many of those starts are new. They are strategic investments. Some of their products have been qualified. And that means they can start ramping, which I think, from a strategic point of view, is something that they will do anyhow, which is also a -- I think, a confirmation of the fact that what they say they're going to do. I mean, that's what we see today. So yes, from a domestic point of view, that was pretty strong. Just one quick follow-up on the comment in your response to the multipatterning question. What assumption had you made in the model that you presented for 2025 on the industry 5 node? Were you assuming single patterning in that? I don't think so. It was not there. And I think it's still uncertain whether it will happen, but we assume single patterning solutions. The next question comes from Mr. John Pitzer. Yes, it's Credit Suisse. Peter, you did a really good job kind of helping us understand for the overall business how that half-on-half recovery will look like in 2019. I'm wondering if you could just do the same thing for sort of the EUV expectations. Clearly, given the slower start to the year, it feels like the half-on-half growth in EUV needs to be even stronger than the 50% you referenced for the overall business. And I'd be curious, as you think about 30 tools for this year, how that breaks down Logic versus Memory. Yes. Well, to answer your last question, we, of course, have a customer that does both. So -- but if you could say -- I would say about 80% to 90% is going to be Logic, yes, and 10%, 15% DRAM related, but we have 80% to 90% Logic. And it's true. I think you will see the same pattern for EUV shipments in the second half of the year being significantly higher than the first half. That's the fact that, that was actually planned also. I don't think it's got anything to do with the pushback. It's more than just the logistic planning of our customers shapes this pattern, yes. So yes, it's going to be more than 50%, but it's just a matter of planning logistics, which we already had. Nothing changed there. Helpful. Then as my follow-up for Roger. Can you just talk a little bit about the R&D costs going forward? It was a little bit higher than we were modeling, both in the December and the March quarters. How should we think about R&D here? And you mentioned kind of the cost you're incurring now for EUV service without service revenue. Is that now fully baked into the model so that it's now a leverageable event as EUV revenue ramps? Or how do we think about that? Yes, so let me start with answering that latter question. The answer is yes. So that is modeled -- that is included now in the model, for sure. On the R&D side, the guidance we get for Q1, EUR 480 million, in essence, that's kind of the run rate that we would expect for the quarters in this year. So our expectation for the full year would be about 4x this number. And so the number that we expect for 2019 with the road maps in there that you're very familiar with, particularly the High-NA, the pulling in of the 3400C multibeam and a number of other things. Going into 2020, I think the guide that we gave there at that stage of around 14% of our revenue, that's probably where we see that for 2020. And perhaps on the R&D number for 2019, I think where we said we took the decision to accelerate the introduction of the 3400C and High-NA as the logical next node in EUV, the multibeam development, we accelerated in the second half of 2018 the hiring of the people to make sure that, at the beginning of 2019, we had all the people onboard. So if you take our Q1 guidance, this is -- and you basically take that on average -- or sorry, on an annual basis, you can argue that we actually created the infrastructure -- R&D infrastructure to do this, and we wanted to finalize that by the end of 2018. And this is what we did. So this is basically the full year effect that you're seeing now in 2019 of the decisions that we have taken in 2018. The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. It's Pierre, New Street Research. I was wondering about like the inflation of the 3400C later this year, how this is going to look like in terms of deliveries. Is there a point in time from which all of the vast majority of your deliveries are related to 3400C? Or is it going to be more gradual with like half of shipments being B, half of shipment being C? And then do you have any update or more like color on how is the economics are going to work between the 2 tools, so the difference in ASP? And then last but not least, I was wondering if your B tools that you are shipping today are going to be upgradable to C and, same thing, what the economics would be there. Okay. Yes, the 3400C will ship in the second half of the year, and you could assume that any ship within Q4, they will be Cs, yes, and some of it will be in Q3. But the majority of the shipments this year will still be Bs, and everything that we're booking now are Cs. So it's going to be a handover, you could say, from the B to the C starting in the end of Q3. Roger, you want to take the economics? So on your other 2 questions, on the economics, as you know, in terms of the specs, the current machine that we ship has a spec of 125 wafers per hour. We've guided that for the 3400C. It's going to be 170 -- more -- over 170 wafers per hour, which means approximately a 35% increase in the throughput. And I think as we've guided in the past, you can typically assume that the ASP kind of correlates with that percentage. So currently, the ASP for the machine that we ship today is about EUR 100 million. So you can kind of calculate what the ASP expectation is that we have for this machine. In terms of upgrades, indeed, we do have options to have a part of the performance update that the C has over the B to also make that available to the B machines in the form of upgrade. Not entirely, but the vast majority of the performance upgrade can be obtained through a few upgrades. Yes. But having said that, I mean, it's going to be a question of economics on this because it's a different lens. So actually, basically, you need to be able to take the hit of quite an expensive upgrade and that, of course, needs to be balanced with the real performance of the B and the real performance with -- of the C. So we'll just have to see whether that's going to happen. But when it happens, it's going to be an expensive -- an upgrade. But having a new lens into that system is not trivial. The next question comes from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Peter, just as a follow-up to the prior question. After 30 system -- EUV system in your backlog, how should we think about the mix of the 3400 -- 3400C, I'm sorry. Yes. It's the -- sort of like I said, the fourth quarter shipments will probably be -- are going to be all 3400Cs. So if you think about this, it's probably going to be around, yes, 5 to 10, but the total is 13. But now I'm going to confuse you that some of the Cs will have -- be fully upgraded new vessel, yes, which is 5 to 10. So there's going to be an in-between version of the 3400C, which was at a, we could say, older-type EUV source vessel. So it's 13 in total. But really, the ones with all the new vessels is going to be 5 to 10. We try to do 10, could be 5 if the supply chain is a bit slower than we think. But overall, it's going to be 13. And that also means that from a price point of view, we will start -- of course, it will be higher, but the 35% that Roger mentioned, that applies to the full-fledged 3400C with the new modular vessel. Got it, okay. And I have a follow-up regarding the -- just the big picture and how do you see the overall demand environment. If I were to strip away the EUV revenue, it seems like the core business could have a couple of quarters of sequential decline, which is typical of a downturn. If I were to look at the late '15, early '16, you had 3 quarters of sequential decline in revenues. And the prior downturns were also a multiquarter revenue decline. In that context, how do you see the current downturn compared to prior cycles? What is different now? And what are the things that are similar to the prior downturns? Well, downturns are always similar in the sense that supply is higher than the demand. And now the question is how big is that difference. To be very frank, we can only repeat or tell you what we get from the discussions from our customers because they have a better view of their market in the discussions with their customers. So this is -- I can only repeat what I said earlier. They talk about a 2-quarter correction in inventory. That is driven, I think, very much by the macroeconomic situation and the macroeconomic uncertainty. So this is a big crystal ball that I don't have and nobody has, so we'll have to see. I'd like to really comment on what you started your question off with, and that's of if you strip away EUV and look at the core business. May I remind you that EUV is our core business, yes, and that we can only ship those leading-edge Deep UV tools because there is EUV solution for 7 and 5-nanometer. Without the EUV, there would not be a 5 and 7-nanometer transition. So that means that everything that we are shipping is -- and that includes EUV, has to do with the technology transitions that our customers are planning to actually capture the value of everything that we still talk about and that will happen which has to do with cloud, Big Data -- and I could repeat the whole thing again. That is unabated. That will happen. And you cannot strip EUV out because it drives this technology transition. It's part of the core business. The next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse. Evercore ISI. I guess, Peter, another follow-up excluding EUV, which you may not like. But if you look at 2019, and if I pull out immersion, which is obviously being weighed down by pushouts on the Memory side, and excluding EUV, what's interesting, I guess, it looks like KrF and ArF dry and i-Line are actually growing year-on-year. So can you kind of walk through what you're seeing that's driving that, whether it's legacy 200-millimeter China advanced logic? Would love to hear what is driving that, including as well whether there's a rising litho intensity that we should be thinking about. Yes. I think it's -- C.J., that's answered as well as you are right. If you read those numbers, I think there are 2 areas where we see, from a product point of view, an increase, which is eerie, which we talked about. And like I said earlier, you cannot strip this out because it's just part of the entire development in the industry. And indeed, we have KrF. We have dry. Deep UV is also higher currently than what we think that we saw in 2018, and that has to do with, indeed new fabs, has to do with China. It is not that much higher, but indeed, it doesn't show a reduction in system sales. And this is also what Roger referred to, that this mix, this Deep UV mix, which is a mix of immersion and KrF, is of course in the first half leading to this 2.5% reduction in the gross margin. But with the immersion systems picking up in the second half, that will resolve itself. But it is indeed the right correction -- the right conclusion that you drew of the KrF systems being higher than in previous quarters. And of course, EUV in entirety of 2019. Very helpful. And as a follow-up, I guess, specific to EUV gross margins, it looks like you came in around 20% in Q4 of '18, if I pro-forma that onetime charge. I think you've talked about exiting calendar '19 at 30%. Can you walk through how we should think about the ramp there? And as well, can you talk about where you're seeing bottlenecks? Is it still primarily Carl Zeiss? Are we still at roughly 9-month cycle time? Can we get it down to 6? Would love to hear the working parts to gross margins and cycle times as we go through the year. The main driver of that improvement is that we already mentioned the introduction of the 3400C model. So that is the main driver through its higher ASP. Of course, there is an element in there of further reducing cycle time, and as a result of that, being more efficient in the manufacturing of the machines. But the main driver in getting to this uptick of 10% in the gross margin on systems really is the higher ASP on the 3400C model. And then on your question on the 20%, I think you're about right when you say the blended EUV margin is about 20%. The system margin, by the way, is over 30%. So that goes into the right direction. The issue is, and I said it earlier, that we decided in 2018 to at least make sure that we step up the infrastructure for EUV service that we are at that point. We're not going to grow that any further in 2019. But we do get the full brunt in terms of cost starting January 1, 2019, because the EUV infrastructure, given the ramp profile of our customers, needs to be ready and the learning curve for our people in the field is more than a year. So that effectively brings the blended EUV gross margin down. And we said it earlier, we don't have yet coverage of that EUV service infrastructure. It will only start by the end of the year when we start seeing the first HVM, high-volume manufacturing, wafer output, for which we will get paid. And of course, that will accelerate throughout 2020 and beyond. So the service burden, and Roger talked about it, is I think the main reason why there is a gap between the 30% and the 20% that you calculated. The next question comes from Mr. Amit Harchandani. Amit Harchandani from Citi. Just a quick question, if I may, to begin with on the Installed Base Management side of things. Given your comments, you've talked about a mid-single-digit or a single-digit growth in installed base over the course of 2019. Just wondering if you could elaborate on the puts and takes of that and what could push it lower or higher. The reason I ask this is because, as I look at the number for 2019 and then I look at some of the scenarios you had laid out for 2020, I think the Installed Base number was seen at about EUR 3.6 billion to EUR 3.7 billion in 2020. Just wondering if you still think you could get to that number, what would drive that around? And again, what would be the implications for gross margin? Because I do understand this is a [ lid ] of the higher gross margin. Yes, yes. I think on the gross margins, you do understand this always will have an impact -- a positive impact on the gross margin. But the single-digit number for this year is also driven by what Roger said earlier. I mean, we did have a supply chain issue because of the supplier of some of the electronics and the motion control, Prodrive. That fire had an impact on the upgrades that we were planning to do in the first half of this year. Now we're using those components to shipments. That actually means that the upgrades are coming back in the second half of the year, but those are complex upgrades for which we simply don't have the service capacity to do all the upgrades to basically catch up 6 months -- or it's actually 12 months of business in 6 months' time. So for the year, you would see that, that actually gives you a lot -- you just lose upgrade business, and that brings the growth percentage down to single digit. Now hopefully, I do assume we do not have a similar situation in 2020. And then, it should really correct itself. So it is the single-digit growth has to do with the fact that we cannot recuperate 12 months in 6 months. That's the main reason. okay. So you still are quite confident in getting to that EUR 3.6 billion, EUR 3.7 billion. It's just a temporary issue? Still our target. The next question comes from Mr. Stephane Houri. This is Stephane Houri from ODDO. I have a question about the second half outlook. Just to understand a little bit more what you're saying basically. Are you banking on any recovery in the memory DRAM or nonspace to talk about this tool increase? Or is it just based on the Logic business? And if ever it was happening, do you have enough -- would you have enough capacity to meet the demand? To answer your last question, yes, we will have enough capacity. Generally, it's really driven by Logic, a strength in the second half. We do expect, when we talk to our memory customers, that we do expect some recovery in H2. But when you look at H2, it will be a strong Logic-driven half. Okay, okay. And I have a short follow-up. You said during your remarks that the EUV deliveries, the 30 machines that you're talking about, were covered by your order book. How do you see 2020 for EUV shipments? 2020 shipments, well, I can only refer to what we showed at the Capital Markets Day where we showed you the moderate numbers. You should take that number. Now that can change. And as a very wise person told me lately, I'm an optimist that worries a lot. So -- but I am optimistic on 2020 because I'm optimistic on the performance of the 3400C. And that means that if we can prove, and I think we will, that by the end of this year you have a EUV tool that has availability of over 90% with 170 wafers per hour and the economics for EUV are so convincing that I believe that our customers are definitely going to -- will look at their plans and you'll see which layers in Logic, but particularly at DRAM, are now eligible for EUV introduction. So I would refer to right now -- I would refer to the Capital Markets Day and the moderate market scenario we've put in there. It gives you the EUV number. But I -- that also tell you that I've been very much looking forward to the performance of the 3400C, which we have a lot of confidence. And that might trigger additional demand in 2020. The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku. It's Bank of America. Two questions, if I could. Firstly, just looking through the ramp that you'll need to deliver on EUV and DUV, I just wanted to better understand what EUV tool capacity you will have in the second half of this year. My understanding was it will be 10 per quarter in 2020. So any color there would be very helpful. And then secondly, just trying to practically think about why R&D would come down in 2020 versus 2019 levels. Practically, what exactly will drive this cut? If you could give some color on that, that'd be helpful. Yes, I think the shipment capability, I think you're about right. The second half of the year, in Q4, we should have a tempered quarter run rate, which actually means, to one of the earlier questions, that the cycle time is coming down -- the factory cycle time. The integral cycle time of EUV, which includes also the supply chain, is still well over 12 months. But our integral cycle time in the factory should go down to anywhere between 15 and 18 weeks. So that is a big task for us. And that will actually mean that we will be able to do 10 shipments per quarter. As it relates to R&D, an important portion of the acceleration of the R&D effort that we talked about is related to the introduction of the 3400C model, which, as we've already explained, is going to happen this year. So with that essentially done, that means that there is some leeway there and that we would be able to manage down the total R&D expenses because that research is done. And we're very well able to do that because, in addition to all headcount that Peter already talked about, there is a lot of farm-out that we have there. So in that way, we think we can manage that down to the number that we've guided for 2020. Understood. And just a quick clarification on Q2 gross margin. You clearly said gross margins will improve in the second half. Would it be reasonable to assume that Q2 gross margin will be similar to the Q1 gross margin? Or would that be too pessimistic? We'll get there in a couple of months. As we said, we think the conditions that exist for Q1, to a very large extent, also exists for Q2 and the major recovery items that we discussed are going to kick in, in the second half. The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. It's Andrew from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, also one follow-up and then another question. Peter, in response to an earlier question, you suggested that, indeed, there had not really been any change to delivery plans or shipment plans through the quarters of 2019. Clearly, you're still saying 30 units in total but I just wanted to, first of all, make sure that, indeed, your customers haven't really changed any plans on that front. Yes, that's correct. I mean, we haven't seen any customer pushbacks on the EUV shipments. Okay. And in relation to that, there's some discussion in parts of the industry and parts of the financial markets about perhaps not so much concerns on your customer side but [indiscernible] side but perhaps the customers' customer, some of the fabless guys with a little bit of trepidation as to how the ramp of EUV is going to go and what that means for high-volume manufacturing and their ability to get the chips out to the other side. Are you having -- are you hearing those fears? Are you having those  discussions with some of the fabless chip vendors? What are you doing to help sort of, yes, satisfy those concerns? Well, the customers are our customers. They're a bit more distance, as you can imagine. We do have interactions with customers of customers, but that's largely on the road map and not so much on the operational situation at our customers. I mean, we don't discuss our customers' production capability or the capacity of our customers. We don't have that insight. Like I said, we do talk about the road map, and I think in the discussions that we've had with customers of our customers, it's also in our mind pretty clear that they all understand that EUV is here and it actually works. Now having said that, what is particularly important is not so much the lithographic performance. I think the lithographic performance of the machine itself is actually better. Every time, it's better than what was anticipated and that's -- that actually drives a lot of the design. So this is good. Now we are, of course, not yet at a availability and at a, let's say, maturity level that we would like to see for high-volume manufacturing. The 3400C, with all the improvements that are in there, there's also a lot of availability improvements in there, and that is going to be the proof of the pudding. And I think this will -- this is why I also said in an answer to an earlier question that the 3400C and its performance is going to be a big driver also in 2020. And we're confident that we're going to get there. And I can't imagine that customers of our customers that are -- even though they are further away from us, that they want to see this first. Well, they will get an opportunity to see this in the second half of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question. Operator, may we have the last caller, please? Yes, sir. The last question will come from Mr. Varun Rajwanshi. Sandeep Deshpande here at JPMorgan. My question is regarding, Peter, about the -- you mentioned in one of your press releases that your DRAM windows are looking at EUV at this point. My question is, with this throughput going to 170 wafers per hour, I mean, in 2019, you've got majority of your tools going to probably TSMC. Will the DRAM guys be able to contribute enough tools to do that 33 to 35 tools next year? Or you think there are going to be other contributors beyond DRAM in terms of EUV tools in 2020? No, I think DRAM is definitely an additional contributor. It will be small this year, as I said earlier. But they're going to be more -- it's just more than one DRAM manufacturer we're going to ship the retool to. So that is very much a function of our ability to bring the 3400C up to maturity levels that customers need for DRAM. I think we can do that. I think the -- everything that is -- that we have in front of us, which is the availability improvements in the EUV source, the higher productivity, the 170 wafers per hour, those are all ingredients that make it attractive for DRAM customers to start using EUV in DRAM. So I think there is little doubt there. So it's up to us. It's up to us and to the customer to make sure that what is in the 3400C can actually be used in high-volume manufacturing. And then that will drive 2020 demand also. It's really the success of the introduction that will drive this additional demand. And then one quick follow-up on your gross margin. I mean, given the weaker first half gross margin with the -- your expectation that there'll be a big snapback in the second half, do you still think that your gross margin on an overall basis will grow in 2019 versus 2018? You can do the math. I mean, you have 6 months of pushback in the overall gross margin. You have to be pretty -- it has to be pretty high to make that --- to make it all up. Now what we actually said is, I think the recovery, driven by all the reasons that Roger talked about, I think we will see gross margin exiting the year in Q4 that are trending nicely towards the 50%-plus that we said we would see in 2020. Now on behalf of ASML's Board of Management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Of course, sir.

Welcome to the ASML 2019 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 17, 2019. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to open the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn this conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today from ASML's headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. Subject of today's call is ASML's 2019 first quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction. Thank you, Skip. Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 results conference call. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. And Roger will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. Roger, if you will. Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2019. Although this was a modest quarter, in absolute numbers, we did report both sales and gross margin above our guidance. Q1 net sales came in at EUR 2.23 billion, slightly above guidance, driven by an additional EUV shipment in the quarter. Net systems sales of EUR 1.69 billion was more weighted towards Logic, 60%, with the remaining 40% for Memory, the same split as previous quarter. We reported EUV system revenue of EUR 371 million from 4 shipments. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 540 million, which was slightly lower than guided due to lower upgrade business. Gross margin for the quarter was 41.6%, which is slightly higher than the 40% guided due to a favorable Deep UV mix more than compensating for gross margin impact of one additional EUV system. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses came in a little lower than guided with R&D expenses of EUR 473 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 121 million.Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 55 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.28 billion. Moving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at EUR 1.40 billion. Logic order intake was 75% of total value with the remaining 25% from Memory, again reflecting the strong logic demand expected this year. We took 3 new EUV orders in the quarter. Net income in Q1 was EUR 355 million, representing 15.9% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 0.84. This was favorably impacted by a one-off tax benefit. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2019. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast to Q2 includes around EUR 600 million of EUV system revenue on 6 expected shipments in Q2. We expect our Q2 installed base management revenue to be around EUR 700 million. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 41% and 42%. The lower-margin EUV revenue will be compensated by higher-margin non-EUV business. We continue to expect further improvements in gross margin in the second half driven by higher system sales, increased field upgrades, shipment of higher-margin NXT:3400C systems as well as contribution of EUV service revenue. This will provide a significant step towards our 2020 target of over 50%. Expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR 485 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 125 million. Our estimated 2019 annualized effective tax rate is around 11% because of a one-off tax benefit in 2019. We still expect our long-term effective tax rate to be 14%.As we remain confident in our long-term growth, we will propose a 50% increase versus last year in our dividend to EUR 2.10 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 24 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 0.9 billion. We still expect to execute the remaining EUR 1.3 billion of the 2018-2019 share buyback program this year with a weighting towards the back of the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter. Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, although it was a modest quarter, the results came in above our guidance, and we expect further strengthening in the coming quarters. There continues to be volatility in the markets due to the macroeconomic environment, and some uncertainty remains in the semiconductor industry. Our memory customers are going through a period of rebalancing supply and demand with an expected improvement in their business conditions over the course of the year. Our view of 2019 remains unchanged from last quarter. We continue to expect overall growth in 2019 with increasing demand for our products as we move through the year. The fundamental end market drivers clearly remain in place as expanding end market applications continue to fuel the demand for high-performance compute and high-performance memory. In Memory, the NAND market continues to digest the high level of capacity additions over the past few years, and this digestion started last year and will likely extend through most of this year. DRAM market is also seeing softening in the near-term demand as they work through an inventory correction. And based on our customers' view, we continue to expect memory demand for our litho systems down around 20% relative to last year. But bear in mind, there is a portion of this memory demand that supports new technology as well as new domestic Chinese customers, and this demand is clearly more strategic and will -- is very likely to happen independent of the near-term global bit demand.If you remove these 2 components from our estimated 2019 memory demand, you get the lithography spend for memory bit supply that is 30% lower than the comparable spend in 2018. This reduction in spend is significant and will help in correcting the supply-demand balance. And on top of this, we have seen a significant reduction in wafer output in the memory space. This quick reaction to the changes in the end market demand is clearly different from what we've seen in earlier cycles and will also help in correcting the inventory situation. The Logic segment is expected to be the growth driver in 2019 with the majority of the demand linked to technology transitions and production capacity for advanced nodes. We still expect this Logic business to be up around 50% relative to last year, driven by Deep UV as well as significant EUV demand. Furthermore, we still expect single-digit percentage growth of installed base revenue. On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV customers are starting production of the most advanced logic processes on our NXE:3400B systems, with plans to transition to the higher-productivity NXE:3400C systems in the second half of the year. First set of qualified NXE:3400C optics are in our factory. These higher transmission optics will enable the higher throughput of 170 wafers per hour. We expect these systems will deliver the next level of cost-effective shrink in both Logic and Memory. We shipped 4 EUV systems in Q1 and are all in track to ship to plants 30 systems in 2019.In Deep UV, we continue to innovate in support of future nodes and new applications. Driven by continued high level of demand for Dry products, we will bring the Dry -- the Deep UV Dry products to the high-performance NXT platform, starting with the NXT:1470 planned for delivery mid next year. We also see increasing demand for 200-millimeter TWINSCAN systems across all dry wavelengths and industry segments. For instance, in thin film head manufacturing, we recently received an order for a special version of the XT:1470K (sic) [ XT:1460K ], which is a dry ArF platform, which is expected to enable the shrink road map at a leading hard disk storage manufacturer.In our application business, our computational lithography deep-learning technology has been adopted at several leading-edge customers. We continue to make progress in e-beam technology and are on track to deliver a multi-beam system for this year for R&D with plans for commercial product shipments in 2020. With the announcement of the acquisition of Mapper's IP assets in January, more than 100 former Mapper employees accepted jobs from ASML and are now working on the development road map of our e-beam and application products. In summary, despite uncertainty in the current environment, we continue to see market demand that supports another growth year with strengthening of both sales and profitability quarter-on-quarter this year. Logic will be the primary driver of growth this year, supported by technology transitions and production ramp of the most advanced nodes. As discussed, Memory includes more uncertainty, on the one hand, because of the uncertainty of global bit demand, but on the other hand, due to fast adjustment of production capacity and, therefore, presents both a risk and an opportunity. Overall, our view of the business is largely unchanged from last quarter. We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets with significant growth potential beyond 2020. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. Beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible. Now operator, could we have your final instructions and then first question please? [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mr. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. I guess first question on your Memory outlook, if I were to exclude expected EUV shipments, it looks like Memory half -- over half for you guys is roughly up 30%, give or take, in the second half. And so curious there, is that all largely shrinks? Or are you starting to see greenfield from the 3D NAND side? I would love to hear your thoughts and any color on that from you. Well, thank you, CJ. No capacity additions on the 3D NAND side. That's not what we're seeing. It's really technology transitions other than EUV. So it's largely in the DRAM space. Okay. Helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, as you think about DRAM and adoption of EUV, it sounds like, perhaps, layer count could increase from perhaps to as many as 4 layers, would love to hear how you're thinking about that, how you're thinking about that ramp and I guess what contributions to EUV we could see into the 2020-2021 time frame. Yes. That's a very good question. I think as you know, DRAM is much more -- we started -- I think we discussed this on previous calls also. It's much more cost-sensitive than the logic space. It actually means that the higher productivity EUV tools, the 3400C, is the tool of record for DRAM manufacturing. Now clearly, we're in the process of maturing that 3400C tool in terms of availability, in terms of the productivity, of course, we seem to be proven in the customer fab. So I would expect that by the end of this year, I would say somewhere in Q4, where we see the first results of those tools in the customer fabs. And we would need the projected wafers-per-day productivity, which is a result of the raw throughput plus the availability. That will really drive the number of layers, ultimately, in application of DRAM. I would expect, though, that customers will first allocate a relatively small portion of their output to EUV because it's a new technology, it's a new process. But when that is proven, that can accelerate. So it's -- you could really say it's really up to us to make sure -- and of course, together with our customers, because we -- it's new technology, new process technology, we need to prove that in the course of this year really towards the end of the year that the promised productivity and availability is there, that we beat the 2,000 wafer per day target that we've set ourselves and even see whether we can get higher. And going up, I would say, significantly above the 2,000 wafers per day, which ultimately, should be possible, will drive the adoption of the number of DRAM layers. So it's a bit too early to give you a guidance on the 2020-2021. It really depends on how we perform, and of course, it's our -- in our best interest and that of our customers to do as good as possible. Our next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar. It's Cowen and Co. I have two of them. Peter, you kind of reiterated your EUV outlook for this year with 30 units. So is it fair to assume that these units are pretty much locked and loaded and your customers have gotten the green light from their customers to proceed with EUV for their end products in the second half? Why -- I think -- Krish, I think that is a fair assumption because these are not cheap tools. So to spend that kind of CapEx without having the business and without having some -- decent level of commitments from your end customer, that's probably not very likely. So yes. I would say yes. Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then a question on the Memory side. Your Memory orders have been down sharply for the last 2 quarters, and it looks like it's stabilizing at least EUR 300 million run rate levels. And you also mentioned that Memory business should improve as a course -- through the course of the year. But given your long lead times, is there a way to figure out if your -- if DRAM or NAND is going to bottom out at some point for your customers? How many quarters before they will come and place the orders for ASML tools? Yes. Like I said in my introductory comments, what we're seeing is there's a bit difference to what we're seeing in previous cycles. There's the pretty rapid reaction of customers to actually reduce output, so basically to lower the utilization. I think that is an attempt of the customers to quickly adapt the imbalance in supply and demand. Now that will lead to a situation whereby in the course of the year -- and many customers have actually said this, that they expect throughout this year, could be middle of the year or at the end of the year, but throughout this year, a better situation for them and a return to better business levels for them. Actually, so what that means is that we don't expect this year that there will be a big snapback in demand for those systems, because if you lower the utilization now, first, what you will do is use that utilization when you go up. So that probably means that if we see a correction, it's going to be next year and not this year. Now having said that, the -- we are preparing the supply chain. We always have in the supply chain a certain level of buffers so we can have a rapid response shipment ready, which is true for the long lead time items. That's our optic supply and some very long lead time electromechanical parts of our tool. So the first snapback, we probably can do within a relatively short period of time, and that gives us a time to also organize the supply chain if the ramp turns out to be more substantial and longer term. Next question is from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. JP Morgan. Peter, just one first question from me on EUV. You just -- from an earlier question, you responded regarding the Memory and Memory adoption of EUV into 2020 depends on the 3400C. So how confident are you on the EUV shipments into 2020 based on what guidance you've given in the past? And what will drive those shipments into 2020 at this point based on -- clearly, you've already -- from -- probably getting indications from your customers on these trends? Yes, we did. I think what we are planning -- what we have given you as an indication in the past, and I'd like to refer to the update that we gave at the Capital Markets Day last year where we gave you kind of a mid-scenario, where we look at that number. Then I think everything that we're currently seeing in terms of logic demand, the use of EUV at 7, 7 plus, 6 and 5 nanometer, I think that confirms our thinking for that particular number that we gave you. And there is a level of memory shipments in there also, whereby we assume that at least in a moderate market scenario, we will ship some numbers to -- some shipments to Memory customers also. So all in all, I think we have in our moderate market scenario 2020 about 33 EUV units, and that's what we're targeting at. Now is there some upside potential? I think if the 3400C works indeed as smoothly as we're planning, that could be. But that means we should have, I would say, double-digit, above the 2,000 wafers per day level. Then yes, this could spark some additional demand. And then customers should give us a problem to get more out than those 33 systems. But this is what we're currently seeing as the most likely scenario. So that's what we told you back in November last year. And just -- I mean following up on margin question associated with EUV, I mean, in the second half of this year, I mean, you're looking at shipping about 10 tools a quarter. So essentially, you're at scale in terms of quarterly volume on EUV. So would you be expecting to be shipping scale margin as well? You've talked about in the past that EUV can grow about 40% gross margin initially, but then by 2022 or so, going towards the DUV level of gross margins. So do you think that you will be at that scale margin? No. That's roughly speaking the trajectory that we're on. I think what is important to recognize, Sandeep, is that for the second half, it will still be a mix, right? It will be a mix of 3400B machines and 3400C machines. But in the course of the second half, starting in Q3, we'll see the first C shipments with the considerably better gross margin profile associated with that. But what you just mentioned, the 40% for 2020 and then that gradually growing towards the margin that we have on DPV, that's exactly what we confirmed at the Capital Markets Day. Our next question is from Mr. Weston Twigg. With KeyBanc Capital Markets. Just wondering if you could help us on the Logic side, just like you did on the Memory. If you strip out the EUV ramp or the technology purchases, what do you think the core Logic revenue growth would be this year? It's very hard to strip the technology component out there because nearly everything that we have in Logic is related to that. We would say about 85% of our shipments would be related to technology upgrade. So that's the vast majority of what's in there. Okay. Yes, that makes sense. Maybe on e-beam then, just wondering if you have any expected changes in the growth rate related to the multi-beam launch in 2020, if you could give us an idea for what that might mean for revenue or ASP opportunity next year. Yes. I think the most important part is here to make sure that our lead system lens by the end of the year, and that is what we're still planning. And then because it's a new technology, to give you a detailed outlook on growth rates for 2020 for this technology is a bit too early, because it also very much depends on how the technology being used and on the application space. So for us, the most important part of e-beam is to get the node to beam out, yes, get the node to beam out and to have the first qualifications done with our customers. And based on that, we'll be, by the end of the year or early next year, in much better position to guide you on growth rates and market expectations. Our next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. It's Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International. Peter, I want to go back your comment from January earning conference call. You said you expect up to 13 EUV system, 3400C, but you are still not really clear of those systems, how many would be an upgrade from B to C. Is there an update here? And I have a follow-up. Yes. The full Cs are actually less, I mean, if you have a kind of intermediate version. So the full Cs is probably around 5, yes, and so the rest is an intermediate version that will be upgraded later on. So that was a bit of a confusion. That has to do with the fact that not all modules are fully ready when we start shipping the first C with the improved lens and there are other features to that C system that come later. So the -- that is the upgrade in the C version, which is relatively minor. But the upgrades you're probably referring to, from the B to the C, and this is where we don't think there will be a lot of upgrades for the simple reason that the B is a lower productivity tool with a lower price. And if you want to go to the C version, you really need to have the new optical path there, which actually doesn't [ advise ]. It's possible, but and then you have to have such a major upgrade in the field that it's questionable whether it's economical for customers to take the tool down for such a long time and then pay such a high price for the upgrades. So I think the Bs will remain the Bs and the Cs -- the real Cs, the final [ N ] Cs are probably a handful, yes? And there is then this version that is going to be shipped at least with the right lens and with some other modules later on. So those are small upgrades, which are part of the purchase price. And then -- and rather, a quick follow-up. I estimate the installed base of all EUV systems out there this year to be around 60. And obviously, some of these systems are for R&D and some of them are older generations. So let's say 60%, 70% of the 60 units could potentially be upgraded. I mean, you just referenced the economic challenges for upgrading, but then again, I can't ignore the fact that there is a large installed base. And in that context, how should I think about the tools that are already being paid for and some of them maybe halfway through depreciation versus benefit of purchasing an outright C version? Yes. I think it's not 60. It's just below 50, those in the field. But you have to realize that the number of those tools are 3300s, 3350s, and some of them -- and most of those tools are being used in the qualification in the R&D space, yes? So we are -- you are right, some of them actually they are entering into their last term of depreciation. Now -- so some [ wafers ] be used also in the R&D space and will not be upgraded. And also, it's like the 3300Bs, they are, yes, lower productivity tools but also lower-priced tools, but are perfectly capable production tools, and those will stay in production. And that's nothing different than what we did in the past when we had NXT versions, yes, where basically you have a 1950 followed by a 1960 and a 1970. Yes, some of them can be upgraded, but as I've said earlier, the upgradability of the 3400B is there, but it's very expensive and you could argue whether it's economical. So I don't expect it there. On the 3300s, not the 34, the 3300s, I see limited upgrade possibilities, but many of those tools will stay in an R&D space. And some of them we can negotiate with the customers to take some of them back and refurbish them here in the factory, and those are the kind of the plans that we are developing with our customers today, just to make sure that they have a efficient use of their assets. And then those are programs that will probably run over the next couple of years, yes, to make sure that we can help our customers get the maximum amount of their installed base, which is, by that time, fully depreciated. And it will be kind of a trade-in and upgrade program, but that -- those details still need to be worked out. Our next question is from Mr. Mitchell Steves. Mitch Steves from RBC. Sir, I really have 2. The first one is kind of on a gross margin side. So you guys saw a better shipment in EUV and you guys talked about better EUV profitability, but then you're kind of guiding to similar gross margins for next quarter. So I'm trying to understand why you're not seeing any scale from the extra EUR 300 million sequentially. So it's a -- so the gross margin from Q1 into Q2 is a bit of a blend. So as you rightly said, we'll have more EUV shipments. And as you know with the 3400B, that means that the gross margin, for that reason, would go down. It will be compensated by the Deep UV business and will also be compensated by the fact that we do have better installed base revenue with some field upgrades in there into second quarter. So if you take the negative from more EUV shipments, that gets compensated by the other 2 developments. And that gets you, as we already said, by the way, on our call after Q4, that gets you to essentially the same gross margin in Q2 as you have in Q1. Got it. And then secondly, you guys have a pretty large target in terms of 50% out there for gross margin. So when do we see that step function in terms of the gross margins? Is that driven by the type of EUV shipments you're going to have? Or is that driven by mix? So just how do we get to kind of a step function from 41% to, call it, the high 40s going forward? You're on a roll there. So you absolutely mentioned 2 very, very important elements in there. So indeed, it is the introduction of the 3400C model, which is -- which as we said is going to start in Q3, and that will be a significant uptick in our gross margin. So that's one big component. The second component, indeed, is mix, which is also envisaged for the second half of the mix in the Deep UV business more towards -- even more towards immersion. A very significant part that we talked about quite extensively also on the call last time is installed base revenue and then, in particular, the EUV service cost and service revenue. So we're working very hard, as you know, at this stage to get our customers and help our customers and go to high-volume manufacturing. So there's a lot of costs that we incur as a result right now, whereas the revenue is very limited, because as you probably know, most of the revenue and service is tied to wafer output, which, of course, at this stage, it's very, very low. So there's a big mismatch at this stage between the cost and the revenue. That will obviously remedy itself in the second half and then significantly into 2020 and beyond. So those are the key drivers. And then we have factory loading to the extent that the business goes up and some other components in installed base, base revenue, including field upgrades. So those are the main levers that we're pulling in order to, indeed, get to the over 50% that we've guided for 2020. And we believe we're on track. So the step change, you will see significant elements of that step change in the course of the second sales -- second half. Our next question is from Mr. Stephane Houri. This is Stephane Houri from ODDO. I have a question again on the services because you've said that services will jump in Q2 to EUR 700 million. So just to understand the dynamic, I thought that services recovery would've come with EUV services revenue in Q3 and Q4. So what services are driving the growth in Q2? And basically, are you -- will you be significantly above the EUR 700 million level quarter in Q3-Q4? So the main driver of getting it from the Q1 number to the Q2 number is not related to the EUV. That is -- that would include field upgrades. So that's an important driver where we had a limited number of that in Q1, as we also indicated, which is also a -- was also a function of the supplier situation that we talked about last time. So field upgrades is one significant -- one important driver of the higher number in Q2. In the second half, the second half, we expect installed base revenue to be higher than in the first half. As you said, we're still looking at single-digit growth for installed base revenue. So if you can do the math of the first half and the second half, you would see that there is about a 20%, 25% increase that you would have to have over the first half into the second half to get to that number. Okay. Maybe a quick follow-up on the price of EUV tools. There has been a fall, significant fall if -- I might correct, in Q1 versus Q4. Is there any reason for that? And where do you see the EUV average price going, given the introduction of the 3300C (sic) [ 3400C ]? So if you compare the -- I guess what you say is you compare Q4 '18 to the Q1, the Q1 '19 number, right, and then the average, yes, I mean the average pricing of all of our machines, including the EUV machines, is obvious to -- obviously, to a large extent, contingent upon the configuration of the machine and also the mix, what customers will it -- let's say, will it go to, what's decide on the customer, et cetera. So there's a number of drivers there. And sometimes, that's a little higher than the average sales price of 100 that we've -- that you typically work with, and sometimes, it's a little bit lower. As it relates to the introduction of the 3400C, I think we've been very clear there. We're looking at a more than 35% -- we're looking at 35% increase in the throughput in terms of wafer -- wafers per hour, and that's, we've always said, translates into an ASP increase from the B to the C level. Our next question is from Amit Harchandani. Amit Harchandani from Citi. I would like to maybe get your thought with respect to EUV orders and shipments going into 2020. As you alluded to earlier for 2019, your shipment plan look fairly secure in terms of customer commitments. But as we look towards 2020 and we look at some of the recent order flow around EUV, how are you thinking -- what's your confidence level with respect to hitting the 33 to 35 that you have referenced earlier? Do you need to demonstrate more improvement to your customers? Are there -- is there -- do the customers have to come through -- I guess I'm just trying to get comfort in terms of when do we start seeing the EUV orders per quarter tracking close with the shipment level that's expected for next year? Yes. Two things here. One is it is -- these orders come in choppy. There's only a few customers there. So it means that it's not a whole bunch of customers. We get onesies and twosies to come in these batches. So that's what you have, one. And it's about the same as we were last year. Last year, first quarter 2018, same thing, where we include the orders come from for 2019 this year, the 30 units. This was the same question, same situation, choppy. But we said at that time, before the end of 2018, we have all the orders for 2019. I think it's the same situation now. I mean, when we look at 33 systems, we look at -- and I relate back to an earlier question, where is the demand come from? It comes from the logic transition, 7 plus, 6 nanometer, 5 nanometer for 3 customers, the potential for DRAM that we talked about in a moderate market scenario. Those are the discussion that we're having with our customers and gives us the confidence that we're preparing for these 33 unit numbers. And we will have those orders by the end of the year to fulfill 2020 like we did last year. On top of that, we are reducing our order lead time to our customers. I mean, when we're in this phase where our customers need to order 2 years in advance, with a semiconductor industry that's quite choppy, they don't like 2 years. Those were actually agreed with them that we're going down to 18 months and 15 months and, ultimately, one hand, at the 12-month lead time for EUV systems. That gives them some more flexibility to better plan. Well, part of that, you're already seeing. So with that planned lead time reduction, our customers will take that into account in placing the orders that are going to be choppy. And that will fill the order book to make sure that by the end of this year, we'll have the units there for 2020 shipments. And as a follow-up, if I may. Could you maybe give us a quick update on the business momentum out of indigenous Chinese customers across the different end markets? Have you seen any changes versus previous quarters? Any further updates from your side would be helpful. Yes. I think as I said in my introductory comments, these -- especially in the memory space, these investments are of a strategic nature because their greenfield companies have greenfield fabs. And the first qualification rounds of the devices that they're making have -- they actually have -- they are behind us. So actually, they are looking at ramping their first lines, and this is what we're -- that's what they're doing this year. So that will happen. So I think that -- we don't see any change there. And I think the same is true for some of our indigenous Logic customers. They have technology transitions ongoing to either 28 or 14 nanometer, which is strategic and that happens, albeit at a somewhat lower level. I think in China we see memory quite significant volume and logic is more modest. But all those plans are stay on track. Our next question is from Ms. Tammy Qiu. So firstly, I have noticed that R&D has been -- keep increasing since last year. Understand that last year you've started accelerating your R&D for the High-NA generation tools. So I'm just wondering that -- is 2019 another up year for R&D compared to 2018 and of course, the year before? Or are we actually seeing some time H1 2019 will be top of the R&D cycle? And also secondly, after 2020, in theory, if you have done all the R&D and all the preparation for High-NA launch, your free cash flow should increasing significantly. So what's your view in terms of your future capital return program? So in terms of the R&D, we're looking at about EUR 1.9 billion R&D for the year. And that's what we've communicated, and I think we're on track. I think the number that you've seen for Q1 is very consistent with that number. And indeed, we said that there's a number of reasons why we're doing that. One is in the continued preparation for High-NA, pulling in of the 3400C development and also, for instance, around the development of multi-beams. So there are distinct programs that underpin that. We've also said that we believe that in the course of 2020, we will see that we're gradually navigating that back to the longer-term 14% number that we've indicated. So you will still see a higher percentage for 2020. But in the course of 2020, you will see us navigating back to that 14% longer-term number. I don't want to spoil the party, but we shouldn't expect that the R&D work on High-NA comes to a grinding halt by 2020. Obviously, that will continue to be there, and a significant part of the R&D work in 2021 and beyond will still obviously be related to High-NA. But you are right, there will be a significant generation of free cash flow. And I think we've been fairly clear on that during Capital Markets Day, where we said, first off, we're going to make all those investments that we deem necessary for the continuation of the business as we run it today, which is primarily R&D, and that's the number we just talked about. We said on the M&A front that it's unlikely that there will be targets both available and attractive for us, such that there would be a significant expenditure on that front. We will sustain our cash balances, as we've indicated. And anything that is available over and above that, we said we'll return to our shareholders. And we'll do that in a policy of increasing dividends. And I think the dividend proposal that we've given for this year, I think, is testimony to that. And anything else that we have available, we'll return in -- by way of the share buyback programs as you've seen we execute on -- in quite a disciplined way. Our next question is from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. Peter, I was wondering if you have any perspective on how things are happening in terms of the clients, of your clients in Logic added things to nodes in which EUV is ran. So there are some reports that the 7 plus nodes might be not as popular and successful as initially anticipated and maybe the 5-nanometer node would end up being the bigger one and the 7 plus the smaller one. So my first question is do you have any visibility and perspective on that? And my second question is, if that were the case, does that impact in any way the cadence at which you're going to deliver your tools? Or would that be actually less impacting it? Yes. Pierre, I think to answer your last question, I don't think it has an impact on the cadence. What you will see is there's going to be more nodes and half nodes and quarter nodes that people are using for different purposes, a different device for different end markets and different applications. I mean, it was clear some of our largest customers in the Logic space have indeed announced nodes that they call 7 plus, 6, 5, 3 for different types of customers. But more importantly, I think when you talk to our customers, they actually say, and especially in the foundry space, that the number of tape-outs for those devices are very significant. And I think you will see a more heterogeneous supply of those nodes for different application and different customers. So -- but when we add it all up, it is the most important. And we see what we think the EUV demand will be next year and years thereafter. There's no reason why we change our -- let's say, our moderate market view for next year. It all fits. But you will see a more heterogeneous and, thereby, perhaps for you guys, a less transparent node-to-node transition. It's getting a bit more complicated. Your next question is from Mr. Andrew Gardiner. Barclays. Just another one on the memory space, perhaps slightly more near term. With the fourth quarter results, I suppose with third quarter results before as well, you had talked about pushouts from certain customers. I'm just wondering -- I mean clearly, you're keeping the full year guidance the same in terms of the down 20 for memory overall and down 30 as you described for the underlying business. But just within that, as the customers are trying to find the bottom in the cycle and return to supply-demand equilibrium, have you seen any further pushouts at least from perhaps quarter-to-quarter basis within the year? Or have things been fairly steady for the last couple of months? I would say they have been pretty steady, Andrew. Like I said also earlier in my earlier comments, there is always the fact that we're in this digestion or this supply-demand balancing phase. There's always a question of how long will it last. And it's going to be basically a function of the bit demand for the end markets, which for DRAM, I think our latest outside analysts -- when we think about Gartner or these guys, for DRAM, hover around to 20% and for 3D NAND between 30% and 35%. If you follow that then, and we just stick to what our customers says and say, well, you could see a rebound in their business throughout this year. And that's basically because the first thing they're going to do, like I said earlier, they've reduce their utilization, which is pretty unique for us. I mean we haven't seen that in earlier cycles to this extent, and they will first reuse that. So they will see their business pick up, of course, earlier. So there are no signs that at this moment, in any case, that they're going to have another round of reductions. I think what they're doing is they're just trying to get the supply-demand balance in order as soon as possible by -- through their own actions. It's basically controlling the utilization, yes, and that's good. So maybe that's the reason why they feel, based on things on the 20% bit growth in DRAM and 30% to 35% in 3D NAND, that they believe -- that is why -- that somewhere in the course of this year, they'll see a rebound in their business. That could very well be. So no, no further adjustments that we've seen. Of course, there is absolutely no security or certainty with these comments because nobody can really predict where the end markets are going. But at this moment, no change. Our next question is from Mr. Adithya Metuku. All my questions have been answered. But just a quick clarification from Roger maybe, just on the CapEx. I noticed Q1 was pretty high in terms of CapEx, the proportion of sales. How should we think about CapEx for the full year? Is it going to be in line with your 2020 targets? So is it -- and should we expect something different this year? CapEx this year will be fairly high. It will be higher than the typical run rate that we see on a long-term basis, but that's the nature of CapEx, right? It's CapEx. CapEx is -- it's not a smooth line. So this year will be fairly high in CapEx because we have quite some development preparation that we're doing for High-NA, for instance. So that's why CapEx is fairly high this year. But longer term, the guidance that we've given for 2020-2025, that percentage of 4% is still the right percentage to look at. But it will vary over the years, up and under, and this year, it will be higher. So if I were to annualize the Q1 number, would that be a fair representation or too excessive? I think that would not be excessive. I think that is a reasonable number to go by. Our next question is from Mr. David Mulholland. It's David from UBS. Just one quick question on the computation node introductions. I think you touched on briefly. But we're normally having this discussion in terms of whether the cadence might slow. And overnight, it was -- TSMC has been talking about introducing a 6-nanometer node and seemingly moving to annual node introductions. I just wonder if you could comment on what you think that might mean for your Logic business going forward, whether it becomes a bit more stable and less lumpy or doesn't change it that much. And then just as a quick follow-up, we've commented on a little bit, but given the messaging around the 3400C, is it fair to assume that the next kind of sway to the EUV bookings for 2020 is likely to be quite back-end loaded this year? Okay. Yes, that could very well be. I mean I do expect that to be also, also given the reduced lead time. So that the -- it's more back-end loaded. But on the -- so yes. And your first question, yes, the impact of this cadence change, like I said earlier, I think it's a bit more heterogeneous and it's more -- it's less transparent what that means. I also think customers are going to make -- customers of customers are probably going to make more applications, specific choices of what they want to use with that particular application because it's not a full node. This is half node. You can even say quarter nodes, yes? That makes it less transparent and also for us. But we do enter discussion with our customers. We talk -- do talk about those nodes that require EUV because that's where the question is, how much EUV would they need. And in that discussion, we will just look at -- we have to look at this blend of EUV applications and the number of wafers that you would need per node. We would need to get to some kind of equilibrium almost to assess how much EUV we would need. But everything we've heard until now with all those node changes, we do believe that what we have in our moderate market scenario for 2020 is the right number. So -- but yes, you are right. I mean it's just starting, and we don't have the full transparency on this. We'll have to figure this out as we go with our customers. Our next question is from Mr. Robert Sanders. It's Deutsche Bank. First question, just on your U.S. Logic customer, I was just wondering if you're assuming that they will roll out 10 nanometer across their 3 mega sites? Or do you think they're actually sort of revisiting what they're doing there? Because I guess it's an important assumption, given what you're seeing in their terms of DUV spend in 2019. And the second question was just one for Roger, just on the buyback. I noticed it slow down a lot, but clearly, you've raised the dividends. So is that just a general philosophy now to prioritize dividends over buybacks? Okay. Well, Robert, as you know, I mean we're -- on the U.S. Logic side, there's not many choices. So we're going to -- cannot be very specific on that customer. But I think that's -- to answer in the general sense, we haven't seen changes in that sense. If you look at it from a point of view of the node introductions, the planned node introductions are actually happening. And the existing nodes are at high utilization because there's a particularly high demand for that current node, which is not a surprise either. And everything else is according to plan. So we haven't seen that much change, to be honest. That's on the -- on that particular customer, but no names. On the dividend versus share buyback, as we said, we are looking also on a go-forward basis, we are looking on growing dividends. I wouldn't people -- I wouldn't want people to assume that it's going to be a 50% uptick every single time, but we are looking at a policy of growing dividends. That's -- as I already answered to a previous question, given the free cash flow generation that we expect in the years to come, we believe there will be significant amounts available also for share buybacks, and particularly on the share buyback program that we're looking at for this year and for the previous year. Indeed, the amount that we have in this quarter was fairly limited, but we are expecting to complete that program by the end of this year in accordance with what we've indicated. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact ASML Investor Relations Department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller please? Our last question is from Mr. David O'Connor. Great. It's David here from Exane BNP. Maybe Peter, 1 or 2 smaller follow-ons from previous questions. Firstly, the smaller node transitions and the cadence change that we're now seeing, what does that mean for the change in customer ordering patterns for ASML? Does that smooth the kind of ordering? And how should we model that from a litho intensity viewpoint? And maybe just one second question on the Memory customers in this cycle reducing utilization versus the previous cycle. What do you think is really behind that? What's the real big change there? And can we expect that in future cycles going forward? I think I don't know exactly what is behind that. You should ask our customers. But it's just simply what we are seeing. I think it is -- had a certain logic to it. I mean you can keep your utilization as high as you can, but just -- that basically means you're driving the cost per device down, so the cost per chip, because you basically use the fixed cost pattern. That's one strategy. The other strategy is to say -- but that could mean that the cycles last longer, yes? They could also have a strategy, say, basically, we would have shorter cycles. They go a little bit deeper, but then the recovery is also faster. And I think this is where -- when you see this, and quite a significant reduction in utilization in the memory space, that looks like that's the type of decision that they've taken. On the small node transitions, the change in order patterns, I don't think so. What I basically think is that it's more the end markets with our customers where they have different nodes that they can offer to their customers and different nodes for different purposes, different customers, whereby the positive here is that the tape-outs that our customers are talking about, the number of tape-outs, are as high as ever. So that means that there's a lot of demand for different solutions. And as long as you all use EUV, I don't see it's going to be any choppy pattern here or a smoothing of their pattern. They think -- it doesn't make a big difference in my opinion. It's just more diversity. So no big change. I don't expect that. Now on behalf of ASML's Board of Management, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2019 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You can now disconnect your lines.","this is Skip Miller, vice president of investor relations at ASML . the length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received . this call is also being broadcast live over the internet at asml.com . a transcript of management's opening remarks will be available on our website .",1.0
2019-07-17,17,7,2019,195.57131958007807,0.018562981940380086,0.0,0.9991,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2019,"So can you give us a summary of the results for the second quarter? I think the second quarter was a good quarter, a solid quarter. With our sales of EUR 2.6 billion, we came well within the guidance. Gross margin, 43%, a bit higher than we guided. Those were the results of some more manufacturing efficiencies in EUV, but also very important some more -- great field sales. Those were sales that were higher than we anticipated. That was with good margins and, of course, that was a result of the -- what we saw in Q1, where we had a very low average field sales because of the lack of components due to a fire at the supplier.All in all, ended up with a net income of EUR 476 million. Of course, up, that's because of, of course, good gross margins, but also a long-term tax benefit.From a order point of view, solid order intake, a good order intake, EUR 2.8 billion, which includes 10 EUV systems. And we shipped, by the way, 7 EUV systems in the second quarter. So all in all, I think it's a quarter that we can be very satisfied with. Let's have a look at the semiconductor markets. There still seems to be some softness in the memory market. What's your view? Yes, I think that's clear softness. That's the result, I think, of -- not only, I think, in the 3D NAND and in DRAM, of some very significant investments over the past couple of years and a decelerated growth in the end market. I mean the end markets are growing less than we anticipated 6 months ago. So that creates softness.Last quarter, we said that memory sales, DRAM and NAND together will be about 20% lower than last year. I think, currently, with the further softness that we're seeing, it's probably, this year, going to be about 30% lower.Now put it into perspective, 30% lower sales, about EUR 3.1 billion in memory sales this year. But as we said last quarter, it's about EUR 1 billion in there, which we call strategic, which are the memory ramps of the Chinese customers, plus EUV. Those will happen. So if you subtract that EUR 1 billion from EUR 3.1 billion, you get EUR 2.1 billion. And that issue really compared -- those are the capacity shipments, the bit capacity shipments, less than 45% down as compared to 2018.Of that EUR 2.1 billion, we shipped EUR 1.2 billion in the first half. So EUR 900 million, the second half. Is there some risk, still, to memory sales? Well, it's a soft business so, potentially, there could be some risk still left. With regard to the Logic market, it appears that Logic is strengthening. Can you elaborate? Yes. I think Logic is actually very healthy. Last quarter, we said that the Logic market for 2019 -- or our Logic sales for 2019 would be about 50% up from 2018. Now what we see today, it's like more like 65%. So we see an increase in the demand for Logic from our customers, and that's really driven by the technology transition.You think about it, it's 7-nanometer, it's 10-nanometer in microprocessors, 7-nanometer Logic and beyond. And that's really driven by those technology transitions that are driving the things that we're all looking for. And as our customers tell us, also things like 5G, so these things are all happening. So it means that, this year, Logic sales will be significantly up and also up as compared to last quarter. Now we know memory is down as compared to last quarter, but all in all, it compensates. So our total view of sales 2019 has not really changed. And in EUV, how are you progressing with EUV? Yes, I think a couple things there. I think good news is that on the productivity side, we're meeting our productivity targets at ASML. We have run now our 3400C version at more than 170 wafers per hour, which is good, which is actually our target number. And we've run -- perhaps even more importantly, we've run the 3400C number now also under production conditions, memory production conditions of our customers and achieving more than 2,000 wafers per day.So from a productivity point of view, good progress. I think from an EUV demand point of view, very much also driven by what we see in Logic, which is the 7-nanometer and beyond transitions. They are happening. So the EUV demand for this year, 30 units, of which 40%, 12 units, we need to ship in Q4, we're going to ship 7 in Q3. So that is -- that's very clearly there. The demand is there. If there's any risk, I would say 40% ramp in the fourth quarter of everything we need to ship to customers this year only in Q4 put some pressure on the supply chain, yes? So if there's any risk to the 30 number and it's probably some supply chain issues that might pop up once we start executing the shipments.So all in all, pretty good, happy. When we look at the order intake also in Q2, 10 EUV shipments, it's just a proof of the fact the end demand is there. And what's your view on the third quarter and the full year? Well, we look at the third quarter, we expect about EUR 3 billion of sales. Gross margin, anywhere between 43% and 44%, but -- which includes 7 EUV systems. I think for the Q4 -- when you look at the total sales, we said earlier -- I said earlier, total sales 2019 will -- remains at our targeted level. Logic, a bit more up; Memory, a bit more down. That means that Q4 is going to be a very strong quarter, a very strong quarter in terms of sales. But also a strong quarter in terms of gross margin. I think we will see trending in Q4 the gross margin up to the 50% level that we are targeting for 2020. And driven by, I think, 4 main elements. One is, of course, the fact that it's a high-volume quarter, a lot of emerging systems. It's good margins there.We see also good loading. I mean, in the fourth quarter, we have a good factory coverage. We see the introduction of the 3400C. So, basically, that's a higher-priced system. And last but not least, we will see the first EUV service income coming in.So all in all, I think the year will be a good year if you think about this. People look at 2019 in terms of wafer fab equipment sales. Now the general expectations will be down this year in the wafer fab equipment, but not for ASML. 2019 looks another growth year for us, and we're happy with that.","we saw a very low average field sales because of a fire at the supplier . we shipped 7 EUV systems in the second quarter . if we subtract that EUR 1 billion from the memory market, we'll see a softness .",1.0
2019-10-16,16,10,2019,255.23489379882807,0.3050732303021575,0.0,0.9993,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2019,"Mr. Dassen, to start off with, can you give us a summary of the third quarter? Sure. For Q3, we came in at EUR 3 billion in revenue, which is in line with guidance. Included in the EUR 3 billion 7 shipments of EUV, including 3 3400C machines where revenue has been recognized for those tools. And as you know, those are higher-margin tools. Also included in the EUR 3 billion EUR 661 million of installed base revenue, which is a little lower than what we expected, but we think we will catch up in Q4 on that. In terms of gross margin, gross margin came in at 43.7%, which is nicely in line with what we guided. If you look at net income for the quarter, we land at EUR 627 million. So all in all, I would say a good quarter. What can you say about your net bookings? The icing on the cake for the quarter, I would say, really is the bookings number. So we had EUR 5.1 billion in net bookings for the quarter, including 23 EUV tools. So that's a record number on both accounts for ASML. What is your view for Q4 and the full year? So for Q4, we guide in terms of revenue EUR 3.9 billion, which is a very high number, but it's also more or less in line with what we said before. EUR 3.9 billion -- including in the EUR 3.9 billion would be 8 EUV shipments. That is a little lower than what we had demand for and also what we had basic capacity for because you might recall that we have demand and basic capacity for the year for 30 tools. And if you add it all up, we would land at 26 tools for this year. The reason for that, as what we've indicated in the previous quarter, is that we had some issues in the supply chain. Those issues have been solved, but it did lead to a certain delay in the rest of the floor as a result of which we're going to have a few systems, so 4 systems really, drop into the first weeks of 2020. So EUR 3.9 billion. On the gross margin side, our guidance is between 48% and 49%, which is a very significant improvement of gross margin over the previous quarters of this year. We've talked about the main reasons why gross margin is picking up as it is. So just to recap those main reasons, a big one there is the pricing of the 3400C. So nearly all of the EUV tools that we're going to ship in Q4 are 3400Cs. So that is a -- and they have a much better margin profile. So that's the main driver. Second element is the EUV service revenue. We talked about that before. A significant portion of EUV service revenue is linked to wafer output. Wafer output is gradually going up, is picking up. So Q4, better than in Q3. And we'll continue obviously to further improve with EUV getting into high-volume manufacturing across the board. So you will see an uptick there. We have field upgrades at a higher level than we've seen before, and that will result in a significant uptick. Also the mix that we have in our DPV sales is favorable. We have quite some immersion tools that will ship in Q4. And finally, with this large volume, we also have a significant factory loading in Q4 as a result of which the fixed cost coverage is improving. So that's why we're looking at a very favorable development of gross margin to 48% to 49%, in that bracket. If we then look at the full year. So if you add it all up, then for the full year, we would land approximately at EUR 11.7 billion, which is more or less in line with what we expressed as an expectation at the beginning of the year, at least at the overall revenue level. If you look at the way it being composed, there is a significant shift even more so than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, a significant shift to Logic, and landing for the full year at approximately what we expected at the beginning of this year. I think it's a significant fee that we're able to do that in light of what I just mentioned, the fact that we have 4 EUV tools that might fall into the first weeks of 2020 but also in light of the weakness of the memory market. I think all in all, we can look at a very strong performance for ASML for the full year 2019. And at the moment, what is your market outlook and your view for 2020? So it's a little early to give quantitative expectations for 2020. But let me give you some qualitative considerations that we have looking into 2020. Let's start with Logic. I think the Logic market is healthy, and that is driven by all the things that we've been talking about for quite a while. So obviously, artificial intelligence. But definitely also what you hear our customers talk about quite a bit is 5G both on the device side but also the application of the more advanced nodes in the infrastructure for 5G, which is new. So those are significant drivers of the demand there, and that creates a very healthy climate for Logic. If we look at our customers, we see them at different stages in the acceleration of their road map, but all of that really translates into good demand for our products and particularly, I would say, on the EUV side. If we look at EUV, our current expectation is that we might be looking at 35 EUV tools, all of them 3400Cs for next year. So EUV, I think, is looking really good. If we then go to the memory market. I think there is uncertainty about the point in time where the memory market will recover. There will be recovery. The question really is at what point in time will you see the recovery and at what point in time will that recovery lead to increased demand for our products. There's a specific relevance, I would say, for DPV and specific relevance for the DPV revenue and gross margin. So that's why it's of interest to us, obviously. If I look at today's market, then I think it's fair to say that the condition of the market today is not as favorable as the market condition that we assumed when we were looking at the mid-market growth scenario that we modeled at the Capital Markets Day in November of 2018. But hey, we've all been there. If the recovery is there, then you will see all of a sudden the recovery will be fast and the recovery will be strong. So I think we still have very significant options and positive options on the table for 2020. On installed base revenue, indeed we do see a significant potential there and a significant uptick from where we are this year. And that is a combination of what we discussed earlier on, which is the increase in EUV service revenue, which, again, is driven by wafer output, which obviously will go up in 2020 in comparison to 2019. But also we do plan for quite some upgrades in the next couple of months and upgrades that will bring significant value to our customers. And all of that leads me to believe that the expectation for the installed base revenue in 2020 can be very favorable. You just touched shortly on EUV. But where are you at present with EUV? Can you give us an update? First off, I think we should recognize that this is a momentous quarter for EUV if you just look at everything that's happened. So first off, let's recognize that we now see the first commercial sales of devices manufactured on EUV. And the manufacturers of that have publicized that in quite a substantial way. So I think EUV is there. It's in the product that you can buy today as a customer and as a consumer. And I think that's a remarkable thing that we should just recognize happened in the last quarter. So that's one important thing to recognize. Second important thing to recognize is we had the first 3400C machines shipped in Q3. Now if you add it all up, it's very clear that the confidence that our customers have in EUV has gotten to a very, very high level. And if you then see that translate into the bookings that we had in the last quarter, 23 EUV bookings for Q3, I think that's testimony to the fact that the confidence levels on EUV are at a very, very high level. And this is both for the Logic market but also for the DRAM market because a substantial number of the -- percentage of those 23 was, in fact -- is, in fact, related to DRAM, and that tells you that the confidence levels in the performance that our new tool, the 3400C, generates at that point is very, very high. So I think this is an important thing to recognize where we are, an important quarter. And just looking back, 20 years of hard work, 20 years of perseverance not just of ASML but of many believers in the ecosystem. And I think this is probably the right point in time to express a big thank you to everyone who has been involved in making this happen. And then that way really was fundamental in creating a solid underpinning for a very bright future for ASML.","for the third quarter, we came in at EUR 3 billion in revenue, which is in line with guidance . we've talked about the main reasons why we had some issues in the supply chain . if you add it all up, we would land at 26 tools for this year .",0.0
2020-01-22,22,1,2020,285.9116516113281,0.12019029747820831,0.0,0.9987,Earnings Call Transcript Q4-2019,"Mr. Winnick, another record year in revenue for ASML. Can you give us a summary of the fourth quarter and the full year results? Of course, let's first talk about the numbers. Fourth quarter sales came in at EUR 4 billion. That's just above guidance and gross margin within guidance. That translates into a full year sales number of EUR 11.8 billion and EUR 2.6 billion of net income. So it's a good year.When you look at those numbers, I think you need to look at the bigger picture. I think if you look at 2019, it was a year where the Logic business was strong. Memory was weaker because our Memory customers were digesting an overcapacity situation.But within that context, the estimate is that our equipment industry, the industry at large, will have a reduction in sales of about 10%, and ASML grew between 8% and 9%. So that's very good. And actually, it's a reflection of, I think, the importance of lithography, the increasing importance of lithography with, of course, EUV now coming on to the scene. And it's our expectation that in 2019 the share of lithography in total wafer CapEx spend has risen to about 27%. So this shows also the importance of EUV. It's also in that context 2019 was a very good year. What's your market outlook? And what's your view on 2020? Of course, January 2020. So it's a bit early to be quantitative, but let's go through the business. Logic, very clear, also supported by statements from our customers. 5-nanometer transition, 7 to 6. It's all happening. And it's all there to support 5G, big data, artificial intelligence, high-power compute. So Logic is going to be strong.Memory, interesting year. It's going to be interesting. Like I said, 2019 was a weak year. But when we listen to our Memory customers, they see the first signs of a recovery shown by memory pricing. And that's confirmed by what we see. We just look at the utilization of our machines in the memory space. It's going up. Now if you look at the slope of that trend and you extrapolate that, I think it's fair to assume that somewhere in the second half, we as an equipment industry will see a recovery also from memory customers. Now where and when and to what extent is still, of course, a bit early, but the trend is clear.Then about Installed Base Management. Installed Base Management will grow also this year as compared to 2019 driven by the fact that our installed base grows. But also, we're seeing the first EUV high-volume manufacturing kicking in. That already started last year, at the end of last year. That will lead to more income because we get paid per wafer. And on top of that, we foresee a pretty strong upgrade business, both in DPV and EUV. So all in all, when we look at the year, we think second half will be slightly higher than the first half but with upside of the Memory recovery. And all in all, I think it's going to be a good year from a top line growth point of view and a profitability point of view, both double digit. Let's have a look at EUV. 2019 was a breakthrough year for EUV. Can you give us an update on EUV? I think the most important to mention on EUV, as you look at 2019, is the fact that we went into high-volume manufacturing, into HVM with EUV, Logic but also Memory. It's also driven by our product introduction strategy, our 3400C is a high-productivity model, which of course helps our customers to drive the cost per wafer down. That's particularly important. So we shipped the 26 systems, totaled EUR 2.8 billion of revenue in EUV.Now looking at this year, 2020, we're going to ship about 35 systems, but EUV revenue will be about EUR 4.5 billion. So it's a significant increase. And more important also to look forward in 2021 because we see a continuation of the demand for EUV in 2021 driven by Logic and Memory. So that is going to be a matter of how many systems can we make. And this is why we focus very much on cycle time reduction in our factory, which will then support a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021. So we're looking forward also to the year 2021. Finally, any updates for your shareholders? Yes. Clearly, like I said, we will see profitability growth not only this year but also the next couple of years. Of course we will generate cash. And I think all our shareholders will agree with me that the first source of cash should be our business. So we're going to invest in R&D and into the operational infrastructure to make sure that we can meet with the higher sales demand. That's number one.Secondly, we've always said our return strategy is that we pay an increasing dividend. And the rest of the money will go into share buybacks. So we will propose to the shareholders' meeting to increase the dividend from EUR 2.10 to EUR 2.40, which is about a 14% increase. And we're announcing a share buyback program with a size of EUR 6 billion through 2022.So all in all, I think, decent returns for all of us.","fourth quarter sales came in at EUR 4 billion . that translates into a full year sales number of EUR 11.8 billion and EUR 2.6 billion of net income . if you look at 2019, it was a year where the Logic business was strong .",0.0
2020-04-15,15,4,2020,276.8380126953125,-0.03173581372035317,0.0,0.9999,Earnings Call Transcript Q1-2020,"Mr. Dassen, before we talk about the quarter, because it's on everyone's mind, how is ASML dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic? Well, these are unprecedented times for sure. And in unprecedented times, you need to make your choices and need to set your priorities, and the priorities for ASML are pretty clear.First priority, obviously, is to keep our people and their families, to keep them safe. That is absolutely the overriding principle.And second, we want to make sure that we continue to serve our customers and being able to continue to really deliver on our road map. Those are the key priorities that we have set. Obviously, we take a number of measures to make sure that we can make up to those promises and those commitments.Safety measures. For instance, as it relates to our factory, to the clean rooms, we make sure that they are completely isolated from the rest of the campus. Also within the clean rooms, we have very stringent safety measures applied such that our people are very well protected. We also make sure that in between shifts that isolation takes place. So we have a bunch of measures around the factories.People outside of the factories, in essence, work from home. The vast majority of the people outside of operations work from home. Of course, we have very, very stringent travel restrictions. Of course, there are the formal travel restrictions, but we also have our own travel restrictions in addition to that. And we leverage many best practices with our peers, with the customers, with the suppliers, just to make sure that whatever best practices are out there to keep our people safe, and nonetheless, be able to deliver on the commitments that we have towards our customers that we leverage those best practices and that we continue to be best-in-class in that regard. What impact has COVID-19 on your manufacturing capability and on the supply chain? So on the manufacturing capability, I would say the impact so far is limited because we have been able -- in all manufacturing locations that we have, we are able to continue to be fully operational. So that's good news. Of course, there are inefficiencies as a result of, for instance, the quarantine measures that have to be taken. That's for sure. If you just think about installations that you have to do at customer sites, so installations, field upgrades, et cetera. Obviously, all the travel restrictions and all the quarantine rules that are out there, of course, they do create significant hurdles there. But so far, we have been able to, nonetheless, be able to serve our customers. Thanks to, first off, the commitment of our engineers. They go above and beyond what can be expected from them in these circumstances. You have to recognize that, for instance, an engineer traveling to a certain location, upon arrival there has to go in quarantine for a certain period of time. And then sometimes, upon coming back has to go into quarantine as well. So there's a double whammy in terms of quarantine there. And in spite of that, people are just completely dedicated to go.We also use new technology in order to allow remote access to what's happening in factories. So we use virtual, augmented-reality type technologies to really support the teams that are out there locally in the field with the knowledge that we have more centrally.So those are the measures that we take on the operational front. So inconveniences, inefficiencies, but at the end of the day, we are still able to keep our operational capability fully intact.On the supply side, we did have a few suppliers that have been confronted with temporary closures. We have been working around those and I think, we can say that at this stage, all those instances where that has happened, we have been able to find a solution. Solution could obviously be that the closure has been lifted, but solution can also be that we have been looking at workarounds. And the workaround could be, for instance, to find an alternative supplier, workaround could be to find new solutions for ourselves. So through hard work and a lot of creativity from our engineers to find a solution to circumvent that issue.So at this stage, I think we can say that the issues that did pop around the closure have been resolved. But listen, we need to continue to monitor this, and we do monitor this very, very closely. And as soon as we get any indication that there might be an issue, we immediately start looking into different solutions, which could also include, looking at safety stock and making sure that for certain parts where there might be a heightened risk that we build a safety stock as much as we can. Have you seen impact on customer demand? At this stage, the demand actually looks really good. If you look at our order intake for the quarter, it has been really good, EUR 3.1 billion, including 11 EUV PO. So from that angle, order intake has been very strong, and we have had no pushouts or cancellations in the year. So from that vantage point, if you just look factually what's going on, demand is still very, very strong. And there's a reason for that, obviously, because a lot of the investments that our customers are making through buying our equipment are, of course, strategic in nature, right? So these are strategic investments that they really also need for capacity building on a go-forward basis.Customers also realize that the lead time for our systems is longer than anything else that they have in the fab. So from that vantage point, it is smart that they -- the last thing they would ever cancel is our equipment. So that's pretty straightforward. And depending on how customers look at -- how they come out of the current situation and depending on what their perspective is on the recovery beyond this point, they might also look at a recovery that could be such that all of a sudden, there is a significant pent-up demand that they need to cater to. And for that, they obviously need the latest and greatest technology from our side. So those are fundamental reasons why customers might think twice before they really push out or cancel our equipment.I think the longer-term perspective, that obviously is the big issue. And there, I think there is a number of different driving forces that we need to look into. On the one hand, you could say, if the world ends up in a recession somehow, then it's fair to say that some of the end markets that, of course, we have to look into as well, think of smartphones, think of automotive, et cetera. Of course, some of those end markets are correlated to GDP, right? So to the extent that GDP would take a hit, it is fair to assume that also some of those end markets might take a hit.On the other hand, it's also clear that you might be looking at a number of applications that in today's environment are in higher demand than ever, right? So anything that is related to working at home, obviously, is in high demand. So anything related to notebooks, advanced communication systems, but also data warehouses, I mean, those products are in very, very high demand. So I think we will have to see and so do our customers with whom we are in very, very close contact at this stage and who tell us that at this stage, they're still looking at fab operations that they say are pretty novel. But of course, they are looking as well, what's happening and how will ultimately, this balance between the different factors that I just mentioned, how will that pan out. And I think that will ultimately drive the medium-term demand for -- in the end markets and then the medium-term demand for our products. What measures are you taking to manage cost and to preserve your cash? Well, of course, critical for the CFO, right? So -- and I guess for good reasons. Given the uncertainty that we just talked about, uncertainty short term, medium term, I think, it is prudent to look at cash preservation.Our starting point is very healthy, right? So if you look at our starting point, if you look at the quality of our balance sheet, if you look at the cash that we have at hand, if you look at the flexibility within our business model, the flexibility of our cost structure, I think our starting point is really good. But the way we look at cash preservation is not just for ourselves. We also look at cash preservation in order to make sure that our entire ecosystem, including our supply base that we can support them in the current environment. So that's why cash preservation is very important to us.So in that regard, we took a number of measures, recently. In the press release that we issued a couple of weeks ago, we indicated that we paused the share buyback in Q1 after having done EUR 507 million of share buyback in Q1. And we also said that we wouldn't execute on share buybacks in the second quarter. So that is a first significant measure in terms of cash preservation.Secondly, we are looking at head count. We will still grow in head count also for the remainder of this year, but we will only grow in head count where it is related to what we call business critical, right? So only to the extent that it's really business critical. So related to our capability, related to the R&D that we think is essential, only then will we grow in head count.And thirdly, we are looking at OpEx and CapEx. And also there, we apply a pretty high hurdle in terms of business criticality. And only to the extent that we think it's business critical, then we will continue with certain OpEx and CapEx projects.Again, there, I think it's key for us that we continue to -- that we continue the development around future technology road maps. So anything related to that, including the High-NA program, the accelerator is pushed down and will continue to be pushed down because we think it is critical that also coming out of the current situation that we are able to provide our customers with the greatest technology and the latest and greatest tools that they will need, in order to then cater to the demand that in that recovery situation will come up. Let's have a look at the results then. Can you give us a summary of the first quarter results? Sure. So revenue came in at EUR 2.44 billion. And you should compare that to the EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion that we originally guided. Two main deltas there, in that regard.The first delta, so the first gap to the original EUR 3.3 billion to -- EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion guidance that we gave is related to installed base revenue. Installed base revenue came in at EUR 857 million, which is about EUR 100 million shy of where we guided. So -- and the main reason for that is that we didn't get the machine time of customers that we needed to complete some field upgrades. And also, it took a little bit longer for some customers to have the final acceptance of some field upgrades done.So as a result of that, we have a little bit of revenue around this EUR 100 million revenue that will shift into the next quarter. So it's not gone for the year, but it's just shifted away from Q1 into the next quarters.The second delta is related to system sales. And there, we have about a EUR 700 million delta, about EUR 200 million in Deep UV, EUR 500 million in EUV. And again, there, this is not revenue that is lost for the year. We think this is revenue that will shift into Q2 and Q3, in particular.So let's look at those components. So on Deep UV, the EUR 200 million, there is primarily related to shipments that we have planned to Wuhan and also some other places where as a result of very stringent COVID-19 restrictions, we're looking at significant restrictions in getting equipment shipped or -- and/or installed. So that's the main reason, about EUR 200 million Deep UV revenue that we missed as a result of that at in Q1. And we're working very, very hard now with those customers to get that into the next quarter. So again, this is a mere delay from one quarter into the others.The EUR 500 million EUV is -- can be decomposed into 2 categories. One category is that we had less shipments in this quarter than we originally envisaged, and that's the result of 2 events. One, as I mentioned, we had a few issues where we had supplier closures, temporary closures. So that led to some supply chain issues around EUV. We also had some longer-than-planned cycle time on EUV and on the completion of EUV systems. I will address those a little bit later. But that combination led to this quarter only 4 systems being shipped, which was lower than we originally anticipated. So that's one angle. Again, we're on track to still get to the 35 EUV systems that we planned for the year. So we will make up for that in the remainder of the quarter -- of the year. But for the quarter, obviously, that means that we only had 4 systems shipped.In addition to that, of those 4 systems, we could only recognize revenue for 2. And the reason for that is that we had customers that, in light of the situation and in light of the travel restrictions, the transportation restrictions, logistics restrictions that they looked at, they said, ""Give us the tool as soon as you can."" And that meant in that instance that 2 customers said, ""Give us those tools before they are really tested within your own factory."" So just ship them to us even though the complete testing program has not yet been executed.And the result of that is that we can only recognize revenue on those 2 tools at the point in time where the tools are installed at the customer and then the acceptance of the customer happens at the time that the system is fully installed at the customer's fab. So 4 systems shipped, but only on 2 of those, revenue could be recognized. For the other 2, this shifts to the second or the third quarter at the point in time where the final acceptance at the customer site happens. So that's it on the revenue side.On the gross margin side, we had a gross margin of 45.1%, lower than what we guided, driven by 2 events that I already mentioned. First off, lower Deep UV sales that I mentioned before, which typically is high-margin business and also lower field upgrades that I mentioned. And that combination led to a deterioration of the gross margin percentage.Net income for the quarter, EUR 391 million. And as I already mentioned, the order intake for the quarter, EUR 3.1 billion, including 11 EUV systems. We just touched on EUV. Can you give us an update on where you are with EUV? So if you look at the way EUV is developing also at the technological front, it's interesting to look at the February SPIE Conference that was out there. I recommend that to all the analysts to look at that. There is a good website with a lot of good material on there. And I think what that echoes is the confidence of the entire ecosystem in EUV. So it's very clear that not just ASML, but the entire ecosystem is completely ready and very, very active in the continued development of EUV. So really good progress on that front within the entire ecosystem.I mentioned the longer-than-planned cycle time. That is related to the modular vessel, and we talked about the modular vessel and in-line refill, in the past. Those are essential elements in increasing the serviceability and also the availability of the EUV tool, and that was introduced on the 3400C. And as we said, the 3400C that is shipped in this year, all those 3400Cs are in full configuration, including the modular vessel and the in-line refill.The increased cycle times that we had, so the longer-than-planned cycle times that we had were on that front. So it was, in particular, related to the in-line refill as part of the modular vessel. So that is now being addressed. So we're now addressing and you actually see that week by week, we get to improvements in the cycle time as far as that is concerned. And we are on track to actually get to the target that we've set for ourselves by the end of the year because as we also said last quarter, it is important for us to reduce that cycle time because that is necessary to get our total capability, our total capacity for EUV production by 2021 to the desired level, and that's a level between 45 and 50. So that is the capability and the capacity that we're driving towards to get there. And the improvement of cycle time is a critical element to get there. So nicely on track to get there. So week by week, you see an improvement on that front.As I mentioned, for the year, with all the caveats and the current uncertainties associated with that, we're still looking at 35 EUV shipments for this year, even though the quarter started mild with only 4 shipments, we're still on track to get there, again with all the caveats that I just mentioned.On the gross margin front, we're making good progress. And we believe that the -- at least 40% gross margin target that we set for EUV systems that we're able to get there this year. And also, as we've indicated, we want to be a breakeven on EUV gross margin in the course of -- on EUV service gross margin in the course of this year.And finally, High-NA. As I mentioned, we keep the accelerator pushed down on High-NA, making good progress there also with our partners in order for us to be able to get the first R&D tools for High-NA shipped to customers by the 2021, 2022 time frame. By the way, how are the EUV tools doing at your customers? So customers are really taking EUV into high-volume manufacturing and are really stepping up significantly there. There was an interesting message recently from one of our Memory customers who indicated that they had a shipment of 1 million 10-nanometer class DRAM modules made on EUV. So that was a pretty good news and pretty interesting news. And they also indicated that on a go-forward basis, starting next year on the, what they call, the fourth generation of 10-nanometer class, EUV would be fully deployed for that generation, and then obviously, also for the generations to come. For so far, there is visibility, what's your outlook for the second quarter? So as I mentioned, at this stage, revenue looks good, right? At this stage, as I mentioned, we have -- we had a solid order intake. We had no pushouts, no cancellations. So from that vantage point, it is looking good. And if you look at the shipment plans that we have for the quarter, based on the orders that we have and based on the requests that we have from customers at this stage, then Q2 can be a really good quarter. And 2Q, we should be looking at a 50% improvement of revenue over Q1. So 50% higher than Q1. And also at the gross margin level, we should be looking at a significant improvement of gross margin over the gross margin that we recognized in Q1.So -- but you have to look at that in the context of everything that's going on. And we cannot escape from the uncertainty that has been introduced as a result of the COVID-19 situation that we currently face. And we have said, in spite of the fact that we're looking at the good set of facts, we cannot ignore that environment and that uncertainty. And as a result of that, we have said -- we believe it is prudent to not give formal guidance for the second quarter. So that's why we have said we're not giving guidance for Q2.The same applies to the full year. So again, for the full year, if we look at the current demand and if we look at the current shipment plans that we have, that should really enable us to achieve the numbers that we've talked about before and also the numbers that we've -- and the goals that we've talked about in the previous quarter. But again, there, in light of all the uncertainties related to COVID-19, we believe, giving any guidance on -- also on the full year is not appropriate. So all in all, a very dynamic environment for ASML? This is not a boring time, for sure. We're really focused on doing the right things, doing the right things from a safety perspective, taking the right risk mitigation efforts. And -- but keeping the accelerator down in terms of the continued development of our technology road map. So we will be frugal, absolutely. We will be financially very conservative, but we do keep the accelerator down in terms of the development of our longer-term road map. And we think that is critical because as soon as things start to normalize, you will definitely see that customers want to have the latest and greatest. They want to have the greatest technology and tools because they will then look at a new and high -- increased demand for highly advanced nodes, and we need to cater to that demand. So that's why we keep on pushing down the accelerator, including High-NA because from that vantage point, the longer term looks very, very bright. I mean there's no doubt in anyone's mind that semiconductor-based applications will continue to significantly grow in the next couple of years. And we have to provide the solutions to our customers in order to do that.So from a longer-term perspective, we definitely still like what we're doing. We definitely still like the long-term prospects. And let me just say on behalf of the leadership of ASML, how proud we are of our company and of the people that we have, the creativity, the resilience and the unbelievable commitment that our engineers out there in the field, that everyone in the company is really displaying in this moment in time is deeply impressive. And as far as that's concerned, I'm very, very proud to be with ASML.","in unprecedented times, you need to make your choices and set your priorities, and the priorities for ASML are pretty clear . we take a number of measures to make sure that we can make up to those promises and those commitments . if you just think about installations that you have to do at customer sites, so installations, field upgrades, etc., you're going to be able to continue to be fully operational .",1.0
2020-07-15,15,7,2020,382.1475524902344,0.38040129955283786,0.0,0.9999,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2020,"Mr. Wennink, the COVID-19 situation had some impact on the previous quarter for ASML. How is the situation today? And how are you managing risk? Well, we are managing risk through our amazing ASML people. If you look at to the challenges that they had to deal with, I mean, they were committed, engaged, creative, and this is why, I think, the company is in pretty good shape. So first of all, thanks to our people. But I think how do we manage? Yes, I think we have to look at the fact where we're still procuring our parts. We're building our systems, we're shipping them, we're upgrading them. They're servicing our customers and Q2 was not without challenges, especially the first half. I think I want to make a distinction between the first half of the quarter and the second half. First half, we had some supply issues because of lockdowns. Absenteeism around the world. But that, actually, the second half of the quarter came back to normal. And that's actually -- we're in pretty good shape. So of course, depending on any unforeseen outbreak of the COVID-19 around the globe, I think we're managing well. Can you give us a summary of the Q2 results? Yes. Q2 results were pretty good. We had EUR 3.3 billion in sales. Now that could have been EUR 3.6 billion. Because of the COVID situation in Q2, we had some delays in the production in the beginning of the quarter, and that's why we shipped 2 EUV systems without FAT, factory acceptance test. So the revenue will be recognized for those 2 systems later on in this year. So if you would have been able to book those 2 systems as revenue, the sales would not have been EUR 3.3 billion but EUR 3.6 billion, which is, I think, the 50% increase that we talked about, about 3 months ago. So that was good. Margin, margin over 48%. Also, we indicated in last quarter that would go up quite significantly. And that was a result of, I think, the increase in deep UV profitability, the upgrade business that we have. And of course, we're starting to generate EUV service revenue. So that was good. Net income, just over EUR 750 million, somewhat higher tax rate, which was basically as a onetime prior period tax assessment, that lifted it to 18%. For the remainder of the year, I think for the total year, we would guide at around 14%. On orders, EUR 1.1 billion of orders. That might look low in comparison to previous 2 quarters. Previous 2 quarters, in aggregate, was about EUR 5.5 billion. But then you need to look at where we are from an order book point of view, our order book is a little shy of EUR 10 billion with 54 EUV systems. So very well-prepared for the growth of the business in the remainder of the year, well into 2021. Any updates on your product portfolio? Yes. I think also, Q2 was a good quarter in that sense. I mean, very important, we shipped our first multi-beam tool. That was prepared to be shipped in Q1, but because of COVID lockdowns, we couldn't ship. So we shipped in Q2. Very important, I mean it will give our customers a very significant potential in higher productivity in wafer inspection as well. Also very important, we shipped the first  dry deep UV tool on NXT platform. Why is that important? Well, it gives a much higher potential for productivity, which will drive the cost of dry deep UV down. It's the NXT:1470, it's very important. We also added -- there's a little piece to our technology product portfolio through a -- probably I would say a bolt-on acquisition of the shares we signed in agreement to acquire the shares of Berliner Glas. That basically a manufacturer of very high-end ceramics and optics and optical modules, very important for the future road map for EUV and for deep UV. And we'll probably -- we'd have to go through regulatory approval. But we think we can -- that can be done over the next couple of months. So that will close before the end of the year. So all in all, you see some good developments, very good developments in the product portfolio, which is very important for the future of this company. When it comes to EUV, how are you progressing with EUV? EUV is really getting into the realm of high-volume manufacturing, HVM. It's just becoming part of our normal operational profile. I think in the second quarter, we made good progress in shipping the modular vessel, which is a new solution to our EUV source with the in-line refill, very good. I think also, I think as from Q3 onwards, on every 3400C, we don't expect that we need to ship systems without factory acceptance tests. So we'll go back to normal revenue recognition in Q3. That's the expectation. And I think, all in all, still, we think our EUV sales, as we said before, we are about EUR 4.5 billion, 35 EUV systems. And our capacity was still building out our capacity to 45 to 50 systems next year. Now how many will we ship next year is, of course, also dependent on the development -- economic development as a result of the COVID crisis. We don't know what the impact of the recession will exactly be. So we'll probably get a little bit more clarity on that in the second half of this year, what 2021 is going to look like, like with respect to how many EUV systems we're going to ship. So business looks good. Are you planning to change your capital allocation policy moving forward? Actually, business looks pretty good. And I think where we are, and when you look at the road map of our customers, our own road map, the secular trend of growth of sales and profitability is clearly there, and that means we will generate significant amounts of cash. Now clearly, for us, this is very clear to everybody. Our cash return policy is based on -- let's use the cash first for our business, then we'll pay a growing, but in any case, stable dividend. And then for the remainder, we will do share buybacks. Now I think that is still in place. We have a share buyback program of EUR 6 billion over the next 3 years. Now as for the short term, I think for the next couple of quarters, in terms of capital allocation, I think we're focusing on CapEx. So we will have some more CapEx spend in 2020, as we indicated earlier. That's for High-NA and also High-NA investment in Carl Zeiss. That will extend into 2021. And I think because we grow, we will have more working capital. Clearly because there's a growth profile of the company, and we strongly believe in that. On top of that, we will see the next couple of quarters that the extended payment terms we have given our customers. Those customers that actually took the tools in their early high-volume manufacturing ramp. We granted them some extended payment terms, which will peak in the course of this year, and then will come down significantly in 2021. That will also transition into contracts with our customers, not on extended payment terms, but on prepayments. And also, we're negotiating now with our customers' prepayment schedules that will actually help also our cash profile, particularly starting in 2021. So all in all, it looks pretty good. Regarding the current U.S.-China trade situation, is ASML impacted by the recent U.S. export control changes and the restrictions on Huawei? Well, I think the short-term impact, and even the medium-term impact of that -- or the new set of regulations is very limited on us. It doesn't impact our short-term shipment profile. And I think medium to long-term, you just need to take a little step back and look at it from a little bit higher perspective. I mean, you really need to ask the question, will innovation stop because of this? Of course, not. I mean the innovation road maps of our customers are there. Our innovation road map is there. Why? Because it needs to fuel this digital infrastructure that we're currently rolling out. It will -- 5G will be there. Artificial intelligence will be there. We need high-power compute. We need memory to support that. That will not go away. And all the devices and the chips will need to be made to support that. Now then the question of which company is going to provide those devices and those types of equipment? It is company A or is it company B? It doesn't really matter. The wafers will be needed and we will support the lithography systems to make sure that we can make those wafers. Let's have a look at your outlook due to COVID-19. You did not provide guidance for Q2. What's your outlook for the next quarter? I think that for Q3, we -- like I said earlier, we're basically back to normal, yes. So that also means that we're pretty much under control. Of course, we cannot predict any local outbreak of COVID-19, which could lead to a local lockdown situation somewhere around the globe, but it feels pretty much under control. So this is why we can also guide for Q3. We'll guide between EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 3.8 billion in sales and between 47% and 48% gross margin. And I think for the total year -- I just want to go back to what we said at the beginning of the year. And I think our view as to 2020 really didn't change that much. And I like to reiterate what we said at that time because it's still applicable. And I think the logic business will be approximately the same as in 2019, same level. Memory could grow with 30% in 2020 as compared to 2019, and our installed base business with 20%. Now you can add it all up, and you'll clearly know that 2020 will be a growth year and will be a growth year in terms of top line and profitability. So all in all, I think it's -- we're in a healthy situation. When it comes to your customers, what's the situation at your customers' base at present? What's your view on that? Yes. That's an interesting question because everything that we -- if we think about the industry and our customers, we need to put this into the current context, and current context is COVID-19 is there. It will clearly have an impact on the global economy. There will be a recessionary environment, which will impact consumer spending because we can all expect that unemployment will go up. Now consumer spending and consumer electronics, of course, have a relationship. So that will very likely have a negative effect on the end markets, and I think then also indirectly on us and our customers. That's the -- you could say, the negative side. But the positive side is there'll be a very clear transition from what I would call the physical infrastructure to the digital infrastructure. Data traffic is exploding. And there's also what our customers are seeing, significant investments in data centers, in working-from-home infrastructure. That is a very positive. So I think if you put it all together, you get a pretty balanced view. And if you then translate that into the different segments that we are working in, logic, logic driven by the road map. 7-nanometer is rolling out, 5-nanometer is being prepared for ramp next year. And it's all there to support this digital infrastructure. So it's pretty healthy. And then memory, and we said it also last quarter, memory is actually coming out of a downturn. And we saw the trend of increasing utilization in -- for our litho tools in the memory space continuing. And that looks healthy, has corroborated and also confirmed by customers who are actually looking at the market and of course, seeing the potential downside in the consumer market, but clearly seeing the upside in the data infrastructure market, yes. I think -- so that looks healthy. It's also evidenced by our shipment profile and by the order book. And then when we look at our installed base business. Our installed base -- our installed base units are growing. EUV is generating service revenue. I think that also looks pretty healthy. Upgrades, EUV upgrades to the next-generation of productivity are being planned, are being executed as what our customers need, and they want it. So all in all, if you just look at the balance of it, I think we're -- probably, when you look at the total world economy and a lot of types of industry, we're well-placed. And you can always say, we're in a privileged place, and that shows. And it shows in our financial results. It shows in the order backlog. It shows in the confidence of customers to keep executing on the road map because innovation will be the name of the game. And it will put us through this crisis. And like I said earlier, the secular growth trajectory of this company is very much intact.",the COVID-19 situation had some impact on the previous quarter for ASML . but we have to look at the fact where we're still procuring our parts . we had some supply issues because of lockdowns.

2020-10-14,14,10,2020,390.1597595214844,0.020966265462225575,0.0,0.9994,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2020,"Mr. Dassen, to kick off, can you give us a summary of the third quarter results? Q3 was a strong quarter. Starting with the top line, we were able to recognize EUR 4 billion of revenue primarily driven by the fact that we were able to recognize revenue for 14 EUV systems: 10 based on shipments this quarter; 4 based on shipments in Q2 that we deferred revenue for into this quarter. Included in that number, EUR 862 million of Installed Base revenue. At the gross margin level, 47.5%, which is smack in the middle of the guidance, which I think is particularly strong in light of the fact that we have so much EUV revenue in there. Net income, EUR 1.1 billion. If we look at the order book, EUR 2.9 billion, which is a good number for this quarter. Included in there, EUR 595 million of EUV which represents 4 systems, and this is a net booking because in that 4, we also had a demand decline, which was related to a delay in node transition. Important also for this quarter, I think the fact that we were able to, in the first days of Q4, have the shipment of the very first immersion system 2050, which is a system that presents quite some value to the customer based on the fact that it has better overlay control and also has better throughput. On the COVID situation, we had no major disruptions neither in our own operations nor in the supply chain. So all in all, a pretty good quarter. Can you give us an update on how you are progressing with EUV and what your expectations are for the next year regarding EUV? So first off, reiterating the comments that we've made in the past, we really do see quarter-on-quarter improvements in customer confidence in the technology. And that really translates into -- if you look at Logic, it translates into more and more layers in Logic for EUV. On the Memory side, particularly on DRAM, obviously, we see that the insertion of EUV into DRAM manufacturing is becoming stronger and -- stronger and stronger. So I think really good progress on that front. And also on the capability front, we talked about the improvements in cycle time. So very much on track to reduce cycle time to 20 weeks by the end of this year, and that really gives us the capacity to do 45 to 50 systems. So I think really good progress on that front. If you look at shipments, all the way through Q3, we had 23 EUV shipments. If I look at the full year, I think we're going to be a few systems shy of 35, and that is based on customer fab readiness issues that we had and also a delay in node transition, both timing-wise and also in the slope of that node transition. Nonetheless, I do believe that we are approaching the EUR 4.5 billion that we've indicated for EUV revenue this year. You also asked about next year. So of course, there are many uncertainties as everyone will appreciate. There are the uncertainties macro-wise based on everything that's going on in the geopolitical environment. Of course, there is the question related to COVID and what kind of economic recovery we're going to see. So there are many uncertainties there. We also talked about the uncertainties related to node transitions, the timing thereof and also the slope of the node introduction. So of course, with all that, nonetheless, we do believe -- we do expect for next year to see a 20% improvement in the EUV revenue for '21. And what about EUV margin? So still very much on track for the 40% EUV margin for the full year on EUV system sales. And also this was the first quarter where we were able to achieve a break-even situation on EUV service margin. On both fronts, both on systems margin and also on service margin, we continue to make progress primarily by driving down the cost and also by improving the value to our customers. As we said before, I think that in a 2- or 3-year time frame, we will see that EUV gross margin is going to approach the DUV margin. What's your view for the next quarter and for the full year? For the next quarter, Q4, we've -- we guide EUR 3.6 billion to EUR 3.8 billion, which is a little bit different in terms of composition. There is a little bit -- a higher portion of Memory sales in that number. In terms of gross margin, we guide 50%. So that's a good uptick, I think, from what we've seen in the past quarters. If you then translate that into the full year, that would mean that we actually end up at, at least EUR 13.3 billion for the full year in terms of sales, which is very much in line actually with what we guided at the beginning of the year. Not just in terms of absolute numbers, but also in terms of composition between Logic, Memory and Installed Base revenue, which I think is a pretty good achievement in a year that was so much dominated by all the challenges in the macro environment, particularly, obviously, the COVID situation. So very pleased with the fact that we were able to get to that number. And again, a big thank you to everyone at ASML, but also in the entire ecosystem for being fully committed to making that work. Regarding the current U.S.-China trade situation, is ASML impacted by the U.S. restrictions on the Chinese company, SMIC? And can you give us an idea of your business in China? Yes. So let's start there. So in terms of the business that we do in China, last year, we did about EUR 800 million of sales to indigenous Chinese customers. This year, it's going to be a bit more. It's going to be a little over EUR 1 billion this year. And in that, it's a little bit skewed towards Logic this year. And obviously, the customer that you're talking about is a major Logic customer. That said, we're not going to speculate or comment on specific customer situations as you will appreciate. But I would say, in general, we continue to serve and provide service to our customers to the extent that we can, to the best of our abilities, but obviously, within the boundaries of legal and regulatory requirements. We are aware of the U.S. authorities' regulations and also interpretation of regulations, obviously. So we are aware of that as it relates to specific Chinese customers. If we translate that to what it means for ASML. In general, for specific Chinese customers, it means that we will be able to ship DUV lithography systems from the Netherlands to such Chinese customers without an export license. But as it relates to parts or systems that are being shipped directly from the U.S. to such customers, we would need to obtain an export license for that. You earlier talked about plans to improve your free cash flow. Can you give us an update on this front as well as for your capital allocation? Yes. So maybe recapping what we said last time about free cash flow. So as everyone knows, I guess, there is significant investment in CapEx, which is primarily geared towards the High-NA investments that we're making, but also some other capability-related investments that we're making. So that's a significant portion, obviously, within the free cash flow. Also in response to the COVID challenge, we made sure that we had extra inventory. So our inventory level is relatively high just to cater to that uncertainty. And then we also, in last quarter, really spoke about the transition period that we kind of find ourselves in where, on the one hand, we're moving more and more in new contracts towards down payments, particularly on EUV systems, whilst on existing contracts, which, to a certain extent, are a couple of years old, we still have situations where, in fact, we didn't have down payments but we actually had extended payments. So we're in that transition period. I think we're going to see the first benefits of that transition kicking in, in Q4, and then we'll see a continued improvement in -- on that front in 2021. As it relates to capital allocation, I think, first off, dividend-wise, we will provide an interim dividend in November of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share. As it relates to free cash flow, we have a EUR 6 billion program over a 3-year period, which we announced at the beginning of this year. You know that we paused executing on that at the end of Q1 in light of the COVID uncertainty, and given where we are now, we will start resuming the execution of that share buy program in Q4. To close off, what's your view for the next year for 2021? So for '21, as I mentioned also when we talked about EUV, of course, there are many uncertainties that we have to recognize, and those uncertainties are at the macro front, right? So this is about the geopolitical situation that we talked about a little bit and also, as I mentioned before, the type of recovery that we're seeing at the macroeconomic level coming out of the COVID situation. So of course, we have that uncertainty. But that said, our expectation is that we will see a low double-digit growth for 2021, which is primarily based on a 20% improvement that I referenced earlier on, on the EUV sales number. How much of a growth that will be obviously depends on many factors. First off, geopolitical and macro, we talked about that. More specifically, if we look at the Memory market, most of our customers believe that the inventory issue, particularly on DRAM, will probably have itself sorted by the end of this year. And based on that, they do expect bit growth to go up next year, and that is pretty consistent also with the order intake that we see and the orders that we have and the arrangements that we have with Memory customers for next year. So from that vantage point, we do believe that the uptick in Memory sales that we expect for Q4, we expect that to continue to go into next year. On the Logic front, we still expect a healthy Logic market. But of course, it depends on the stuff that we talked about earlier on, the timing and the slope of the node introductions. So that will be an important part in that regard. Installed Base, looking strong. And also there, we do expect continued growth, which, to a certain extent, is based on regular service, which again is based on the installed base that we have. How much of a growth will again be dependent on how much we see in field upgrades. So all in all, some uncertainty, obviously, as a result of all the things that we just mentioned. But I think we're still looking at a good growth year for us next year. And I think it's important to also recognize that all the uncertainty that we're talking about really is short-term uncertainty. The longer-term drivers of our business are clearly still there, right? So if you look at the secular trends in our end markets, so you look at AI, you look at high-performance compute, you look at all the developments around 5G, they're running on all cylinders. Those developments are running on all cylinders, and that really drives the longer-term interest in our product. And they provide still a very solid underpinning for the growth expectations that we have articulated for the 2025 time frame.","we were able to recognize EUR 4 billion of revenue primarily driven by the fact that we have so much EUV revenue in there . if we look at the order book, EUR 2.9 billion, which is a good number for this quarter . on the memory side, obviously, we see that the insertion of EUV into DRAM manufacturing is becoming stronger .",0.0
2021-01-20,20,1,2021,531.2220458984375,0.36155006490151753,0.0,0.9996,Earnings Call Transcript Q4-2020,"Mr. Dassen another record year for ASML. Can you give us a summary of the fourth quarter and the full year results? A record year but also a very strong Q4 with total revenue at EUR 4.3 billion. Included in there, EUR 1.1 billion in Installed Base revenue and both higher than guided. Primarily, I would say, as a result of higher sales in DPV, DPV immersion and also as a result of more upgrades. If we look at the gross margin, gross margin came in at 52%, also quite a bit better than we guided. Again, same results, if you look at the product mix with more immersion in there and also upgrades, that's really what drove it. In terms of net income, EUR 1.4 billion. So overall, really a strong quarter and also the order intake was very, very strong with EUR 4.2 billion of order intake, net bookings included in that net 6 EUV systems representing EUR 1.67 billion. So that's the quarter. What about the full year? As I said, a record year with EUR 14 billion of revenues, included in there EUR 3.7 billion for installed base revenue. Gross margin at 48.6% and net income at EUR 3.6 billion. 2020 was a dynamic year for everyone, also for ASML, record year, as you said. How do you look back on it? A dynamic here, in fact, an extraordinary year. An extraordinary year, starting with concluding as we just did, this was a record year for ASML, but a year where we, obviously, had to navigate the challenging circumstances of COVID-19. And I have to say, the way we were able to navigate that with the stellar performance of our people but also the support of all of our partners, suppliers, other partners, customers have been fantastic. And I really would like to take this opportunity to thank our people and our partners for being able to put up this performance. We also have to recognize COVID-19 is not yet behind us, but I think the past experience really strengthens us, I think, in our conviction that we're able to navigate these really tough circumstances. Further to the results, how is your EUV business doing? EUV is doing very well, both on the Logic front and on the DRAM front. If we start looking at the numbers for Q4, we shipped 9 systems, only 8 were taken in revenue. The one system that we did not recognize as revenue was because it's a new system configuration at a customer that needs to be qualified at the customer still in early 2021. As soon as that has happened, it will also be recognized in revenue. If we look at the full year, all in all, 31 systems taken in revenue, total revenue on the system side of EUR 4.5 billion. So a very significant uptick there of 60% in terms of revenue recognized for EUV. If you look at the gross margin, as we have been projecting, more than 40% was the gross margin on EUV for the full year and on the system side. And if we look at 2021, I would say that with the introduction of the 3600D, that will be the point in time where we will see EUV systems gross margin at the level of the corporate gross margin. And also at the service level, as you know, we broke even on EUV service gross margin this year. And we expect that to gradually go to corporate gross margin, and I would say about 4 years' time, and we'll make a gradual step-up again this year. Overall, how is EUV demand developing? EUV demand is developing very, very strongly. We have an order book of EUR 6.2 billion. Now if we look a little bit into this year and the expectations for this year, we expect total EUV system sales this year of EUR 5.8 billion, which is 30% up in comparison to the EUR 4.5 billion that we had for 2020. We are making good progress, I would say, in our manufacturing capacity, primarily, as we said before, by driving down the cycle time. I think the one limiting factor that we have this year really is the orders that we placed into the supply chain. We had to adjust that in the -- during the COVID situation, so that will be the limiting factor for this year. And what about High-NA? How are you developing over there? Overall, High-NA is developing very well. But I think it's also important to recognize that we have a significant road map still ahead of us for 0.33. And we're very aggressively working on that road map, really putting performance for our customers to meet their requirements, both on throughput, both on imaging, on overlay requirements. We think that will cater to the demand of our customers for the next couple of years. And then there will be a certain point in time, and we think that probably will be in '25, '26 time frame, where our customers will no longer be able to perform based on -- or to meet the demands of their customers by applying double patterning. Then they will have to go beyond that. They will want to reduce the process complexity, and that will then require the need for them for High-NA. In terms of our own time frame, I think this year, we'll see the first integration of modules. Next year, we will see the availability of the first system available for R&D purposes at our sites. Customers will then have access to that tool in 2023. 2023, we will also see the first initial installations of High-NA tools at customers. And again, then in the '25, '26 time frame, that's where we really see a High-NA going into high-volume manufacturing. How does your present business translate into a cash flow dividend share buyback? As promised, Q4 was very, very strong from a free cash flow perspective, as I think people have been able to see in the numbers. So really strong performance on that front. And also, for this year, for 2021, we expect a significant generation of free cash flow. Our capital allocation policy hasn't really changed. So in essence, what we say, what we need and the business will need, so whatever we need for R&D, for CapEx, et cetera, we'll use that in the business. And whatever -- what is not necessary for that, we will be able to distribute back to our shareholders by way of increasing dividends over time and share buybacks. As far as dividend is concerned, we're looking at a total dividend for 2020 of EUR 2.75. And in terms of share buyback, as you know, we have a 3-year program for share buybacks have in total EUR 6 billion. We were able to execute EUR 1.2 billion last year, and we're looking at executing a significant share buyback in Q1 of 2021. What's your market outlook for the quarter and for the full year 2021? For the quarter, we're looking at sales between EUR 3.9 billion and EUR 4.1 billion, included in there, EUR 950 million of installed base revenue. We're looking at a gross margin between 50% and 51%. For the full year, we're looking at a year of continued growth, both in sales and in gross margin. If I just look at the different businesses that we're in, the different market segments that we're in, we're actually looking -- let's start with Logic. Logic already very strong this year. And still, we believe that Logic, we expect that to grow another 10% in 2021. And that really is because of all the changes that we see, the really continued development in the digital economy that we're witnessing and even more strongly after last year. And you see that everywhere. You see it on the advanced nodes with the secular trends in AI, high-performing compute, 5G. I mean those are the big drivers behind the big demand in advanced nodes, but also in the more mature nodes, where you see, particularly in the Internet of Things and also the application of that, both in the consumer, automotive and industrial markets. You see that also the demand for the more mature nodes is at very, very high level. So all in all, very, very positive and therefore, expect another increase of 10% on Logic. If we move to Memory, as we projected, you already saw the momentum being turned positively for, particularly, DRAM in 2020. So you did see some growth in DRAM, in particular, last year, and we see that momentum actually sustained into 2021. And that is because of all the demand for data centers but also the application of memory into consumer devices is something that we just continue to see. And in that combination of continued bit growth, but also the fact that the utilization of our tools really is at an extremely high level that provides us the comfort that we think Memory is going to increase further, and we believe Memory can grow with 20% for this year in comparison to last year. Finally, installed base revenue, again, a significant growth in last year of about 30%, and we expect that to grow another 10% this year. And that's a combination of, on the one hand, the service margin and the service revenue growing. As a result of the fact that the installed base is growing, as a result of the fact that we see more and more EUV tools really going into high-volume manufacturing and really producing a larger and larger number of wafers, so that combination really increases the revenue from service. And we also recognize that customers are more and more interested in upgrades in order to increase their capacity but also to increase performance on overlay performance on imaging. So those are things that can be catered to with more and more upgrades, and they will be available also in this year. And we believe that will lead to another growth on that front. So if you take it all together, what we're looking at really is another year of double-digit growth as a result of the different dynamics that I just mentioned there. We believe there can be actually even more growth than what we just discussed but that would then be under the assumption that we will not be faced with more limitations on the geopolitical front and the export controls front than what we're seeing today. That will be an important dynamic, I think, for all of us to watch for. If we're not confronted with more limitations there, then we believe there is still some more potential on growth than the numbers that I just shared with you. So all in all, we're looking with a lot of passion and a lot of comfort, if you like, and a lot of faith into this year and also, quite frankly, beyond this year. We think the growth trends are there, our products are there, the road map that we have caters to demand of our customers. And that gives us a lot of confidence in the performance of ASML in the short and the longer term. We really look forward to having conversations with all of you in our Investor Day that we will have later this year.","a record year with EUR 14 billion of revenues, included in there EUR 3.7 billion for installed base revenue, and net income at EUR 3.6 billion . the full year was a dynamic year for everyone, also for ASML, record year .",1.0

Welcome to the ASML 2021 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April '21, 2021. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today on the call is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2021 first quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order that they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of these forward-looking statements and involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on form [indiscernible] submission. I'd like to [indiscernible] for a brief introduction. Well, thank you for joining us for our Q1 2021 results conference call. And I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview on some commentary on this quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q1 2021 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. Roger? Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2021. Net sales came in above guidance at EUR 4.4 billion, primarily due to higher installed base business from upgrades. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized EUR 1.1 billion revenue from 7 systems this quarter. Due to the delay in 1 of our customers' road map, we jointly decided to buy back 2 of their new systems and ship these to another customer this year. This was accounted for as a revenue reversal in Q1 of 2021. For the system shipped in Q4 2020 with a new configuration, we were able to complete site acceptance and recognized revenue this quarter. We also shipped 1 system this quarter without factory acceptance testing, so revenue will be recognized in the subsequent quarter after a customer site acceptance. Again, the net result is 7 EUV revenue systems. Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was again more weighted towards logic at 78%, with the remaining 22% from memory. The strength in logic drives both DTV and revenue. The memory business is mainly driven by DRAM. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 1.2 billion above guidance due to increased upgrade business as customers pull forward software upgrades that can quickly increase productivity of systems in this high semiconductor demand environment. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9% and was above guidance due primarily to the additional software upgrade. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 623 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 168 million, which was slightly above our guidance. Net income in Q1 was EUR 1.3 billion, representing 30.5% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 3.21. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion. Moving to the order book. Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR 4.7 billion, including EUR 2.3 billion for EUV systems and another strong quarter of DPV demand. Order intake was largely driven by logic with a 76% of bookings primarily due to EUV order intake with Memory accounting for the remaining 24%. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2021. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR 4 billion and EUR 4.1 billion. The directionally lower guidance is primarily due to shipments in the quarter, both EUV and DPV that will not receive factory acceptance test due to customers' desire to bring systems into production as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will recognize revenue in subsequent quarters after completion of acceptance testing at customer site. In addition, the installed base business is expected to be lower in Q2 versus Q1 as customers pull forward installation of productivity software upgrades to quickly increase wafer capacity. We expect our Q2 installed base management sales to be around EUR 900 million. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be around 49%. The lower gross margin quarter-on-quarter is mainly due to delayed revenue from immersion systems that we plan to ship without sector acceptance testing as well as lower installed base management sales versus Q1. Expected R&D expenses for Q2 are EUR 650 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at EUR 175 million, reflecting a continued investment in the future growth of the company. In support of our aggressive product road maps and opportunity to fill in some of our high-value product developments, we plan to increase our R&D investments primarily in EUV via increased development capacity. Furthermore, this increase will allow us to compensate for remote work impact. We don't expect this increase to scale at the same level as our revised revenue increase with R&D expenses for 2021 around 14% to 15% of sales. We expect SG&A to remain around 4% of sales in 2021. Our estimated 2021 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 14% and 15%. As mentioned last quarter, ASML intends to declare a total dividend with respect to 2020 of EUR 2.75 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 dividend. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share paid in November 2020. This leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of EUR 1.55 per ordinary share. The 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 29, 2021 in [indiscernible]. In Q1 2021, ASML purchased 3.5 million shares under the 2020 through 2022 program for a total amount over EUR 1.6 billion. Our expected free cash flow generation enables the opportunity for continuation of significant share buybacks in the coming quarters, and we expect to complete the execution of our current share buyback program early. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter. Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter in both sales and profitability, driven by continued strength in both logic and memory as well as significant demand for upgrades as customers look to bring additional capacity online as quickly as possible. The additional upgrades consisted primarily of software-based productivity packages. We are seeing a significant increase in demand from our customers across all market segments and all modes, mature and advanced, compared to 3 months ago. And we expect another very strong year with demand across our entire product portfolio. The steeper-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors, amplified by the COVID induced the lower investments of the industry in 2020. That created significant upside to demand over the past quarter. This more cyclical demand sits on top of the secular growth from the accelerated buildup of the worldwide digital infrastructure and assuring demand not only for advanced and mature logic nodes, but also for memory. In logic, customers continue to see strong demand across the broad application space for both advanced node as well as mature nodes. And last quarter, we expected revenue from logic in 2021 to be up 10% year-on-year. However, we now expect logic to be up around 30% this year. In Memory, the applications that are driving the strong logic demand are also fueling demand for memory. As we mentioned in earlier calls, the memory recovery started last year and continues to strengthen its customer plans to increase capacity is driving significant demand for our systems in the second half of the year. Compared to last quarter, where we expected revenue from memory in 2021 to be up 20% year-on-year. We now expect memory revenue to be up around 50% this year. On our installed base business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base and with increasing contribution from EUV services as these systems are more and more wafers in volume production. We're also supporting our customers with upgrades to maximize performance of their installed base. In order to meet the high demand in the current tight chip supply environment, customers are prioritizing software upgrades to quickly increase capacity as reflected by high-grade Memory in Q1. And some hardware upgrades require extended machine time to be installed. And in the current high amount environment, customers will be less willing to take systems down, which has a dampening impact on the 2021 growth profile of hardware upgrades. We still expect growth or is for basics of around 10% this year, as mentioned last quarter. On EUV, we continue to see increasing customer confidence in this technology, which is translating to expanding layer counts in logic and increasing deployment of EUV in memory at multiple customers, evidenced by a number of customer announcements around increases in their CapEx plans, which will include spending on EUV for advanced nodes. To support the strong EUV demand, we are working to increase our output capability. At the same time, we are driving our product road map to produce higher productivity machines, which will increase the effective EUV capacity per system and the wafer output capacity of our customers. We plan to transition to the NXE:3600D system in the second half of the year, which will provide customers with a 15% to 20% higher productivity compared to the NXE:3200C systems shipping in the first half of the year. Limited by the available modules and parts this year, we're still planning for growth of around 30% in EUV revenue this year. With the expanding adoption of EUV at our customers, we see increased demand building in 2022 and beyond. We are improving our manufacturing cycle time and are planning our supply chain for a capacity of around 55 systems next year. And as a reminder, all of our planned shipments in 2022 will be [indiscernible] T-Systems with the increased productivity capability. Our strength and outlook on the year, relative to last quarter, is primarily driven by the demand for DPV systems. With increased demand on leading-edge nodes as well as mature nodes running longer and ramping stronger, demand for our emulation and dry systems is stronger than ever. We have put in place plans to increase our DPV capacity to help meet our customers' increase demands. In our application business, as demand for scanners continues to increase, we expect a step-up in demand for our yield stomatology systems, particularly in logic. The newly released YieldStar 385 is beginning to ramp across our customer base as well. And with the recovery in Memory, specifically 3D NAND, we expect a substantial increase in e-beam inspection revenue this year. For the industry at a high level, we see 3 trends driving considerable growth this year and in the years to come. The first trend: in the shorter term, that's a more cyclical or, you could say, a catch-up driven demand from decisions made in 2022 due to the global dynamic. These shortages were initially evident in the automotive market, but more also indications of supply tightness impacting other market segments. We expect this to drive considerable demand for [indiscernible] systems this year and into next year. The second is a secular growth trend driven by the digital transformation taking place as we become a more connected world across both people and machines. And this transformation was further accelerated over the past year with the increased remote activity and reliance on technology to stay connected. The executive trends are driven by expanding end market applications such as 5G, AI and heart force computing. These and other mobile distributed applications drive demand for both advanced logic as well as more mature technology required for the services and applications that drive the growth of the digital infrastructure. And along with increased logic demand comes increased memory demand. This, in turn, drives demand across our entire product portfolio. And the third trend which we're starting to see now and which we will likely continue to see longer-term is the desire for more technology sovereignty, which includes semiconductor and silicon-based technology, leading to a geographical [indiscernible] as different governments put initiatives in place to localize supply chains and become more self sufficient. Inevitably, we'll create some level of inefficiency in the semiconductor supply chain and creates additional equipment demand as more fabs are strategically built across the globe. If we summarize the growth of the different segments and the trends just discussed, we now expect sales growth towards 30% this year. To achieve this growth, we are ramping up our capacity to support customer demand, resulting in a stronger second half. With the higher revenue and increased mix of DPV and upgrades, we now expect gross margins to be between 51% and 52% this year. Within the industry as a whole, the long-term demand drivers only increase our confidence in our future growth outlook towards 2025. And we plan to provide an update on our 2025 scenarios at our Investor Day in September. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. All right. Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question, please. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SFG. Yes. I want to follow-up on the EUV revenue target for this year. I understand that you're keeping it unchanged at 30%. But in case you're able to improve the supply chain and availability of subcomponent. Could there be upside to the shipment, even though you may not be able to recognize the revenue? And I have a follow-up. Yes, Mehdi, you just used 2 very important words in case, which is the problem because we said it last quarter, we have very long lead time items. I mean the lens as a manufacturing cycle time or I would say them over 12 months. So if you haven't audit, that is not going to be there. So I think when we look at capacity increase, we really need to look at next year. I think it's virtually impossible to get more out of 2021 as we have planned today. So really, it's going to be -- that's why we also mentioned that working with our supply chain and looking at the demand next year, we are now planning and we haven't received full confirmation yet. Of the supply chain on it. But our focus is on the 55 systems next year. Bearing in mind also that, I think we said it before, customers are buying systems, but effectively, they're buying wafer capacity. And with next year, only 3400B, which already provides you with a 50% to 20% productivity increase. Well, if you then multiply, let's take the average of 15% to 20%, 17.5%, or let's say, 18% as a part of the increased payer system. And the 55 systems, actually translated into 65 systems were delivers productivity. So it's -- this is the way that you need to look at it. Great. And a quick follow-up. As I think about beyond 2021 and your operating margin, could there be a scenario where your key customers would share some of the development costs associated with High-NA, similar to what happened to almost a decade ago, so that, that could also help drive overall operating margin to above 33%? Well, I think I don't think it's likely because it's not necessary. I mean, when we go back almost a decade ago, our R&D expense at that time was EUR 600 million per year. And then when you looked at at the size of the EUV program at that time and still you need to consider that the entire loan EUV program will, of course, more, if we don't end it than the High-NA program. So if I look at it, then the relative effort to bring EUV to life was so large that it would have put a significant financial strain on the P&L of ASML which, of course, we could not afford, which is not the case today. And I think if you think about operating margins, it is more a matter of maturity of EUV, which will, of course, lead to better performing tools with higher productivity with higher value. EUV service revenue that will grow going forward. And I think those are the most important drivers for operating margin. Roger? I agree. I mean the gross margin components, I think, Peter, you just referenced them, I think with the ASP and as a result of that EUV system growth margin and the EUV surface gross margin. Those are the major drugs on the gross margin side. And I think also in the introduction, we've clear on what the ambition is for OpEx, right? So 14% to 15% for R&D and 4% for SG&A. And our longer-term ambition at least on the R&D side is to try and model that back to around 13% over time. I think that's what we stated in R&D. And those are the major drivers, I would to get the operating margin further on. Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. . Can you anyway? Very well. My question would be more over 2, 3 years, if I recall correctly, like about my visit in wonder. You guys are sort of to be able to do [indiscernible] per year and [indiscernible] High-NA Btus. And when I took a shot at looking at how much would be needed over the next 3, 4 years, I feel like this was actually a bit a delimited and that you might actually need more capacity. And so I would love to hear you state on that in the longer term, do you think it will make sense to think about increasing your overall capacity? And if that's the case, what kind of let times are we talking that for that kind of endeavor? And I have a follow-up. It's a very good question, Pierre. I think it's a long-term strategic question. Let me try to answer it this way. When I talked about the 3 trends that the company will have to face in terms of demand cycles. That's, of course, the shorter term, which you could say it's a catch-up. But the lower level of investments we saw last year because of the pandemic, which is -- which are catching up this year. And I think throughout next year or I guess as a part of next year, then that's a secular growth turn which we have underestimated. I think you can go back to the Capital Markets Day in 2016 and '18. I don't think we -- at that moment in time, anticipated the strength of the DPV market that we see today. And that's the third trend, which is basically the driver of technological sovereignty by different countries and different governments. Those are all at this moment in time -- those will be the drivers, but it's also difficult to really get a very clear view on it. So your question is, taking that into consideration, should you guys be looking at increasing your capacity beyond the 60, the magical 60 that we've always mentioned. Good question. And I think this is actually the work that we're doing today. We're looking at it and say, what do we need to do this? So now the lead time, now if you have to build a complete refractory, let's take, you need to build a new optics factory and the leadtime is 2 to 3 years. Because you need to do the factory, you need to procure the machines or the, by the way, when it comes to optics manufacturing, you have to build those machines yourself because they're not available. So that will be longer. But a lot of ways to increase capacity and as to cycle time reduction, that's to process optimization. And so it's complexity of measures that we can take to see how we can drive the total capacity up, which, by the way, all have lead times that are beyond the 55 units that we're planning for next year, which doesn't mean that it couldn't be higher in '23 and '24 but that's the work that we need to do today, which a we are doing. That makes sense. And a quick follow-up is very much related to that. You mentioned like the geopolitical situation, when I look at the overall value chain? And how much it depends on what's happening in vendor on a single side, where you have some your [indiscernible] which almost scary it's a weak point for the global value chain and probably a place where your clients and governments are getting maybe a bit nervous that -- so do you have conversations with people around you about diversifying your size and creating supply that would not only tile less dependent on the Netherlands. Yes. I think the -- that's the situation of today is not very different than the situation 5 years ago. Because we can only argue that the realization of people is now different but has never changed. It's what it is. But the same can be said for our own customers that are basically concentrated in 1 particular area or our peers that with some of their production facilities only make, yes, a couple of hundred tools per year in 1 or 2 single sites. It is the concentration of the semiconductor industry in different geographical areas that actually now starts to make governments think has never been an issue, yes? It's only becoming an issue when this an almost seamless ecosystem that has been built across many, many borders are now being -- that ecosystem is now being threatened, I would say, almost by blockages of that seriousness. And then you get an issue. So but I think it's nothing different. It's always been this way. And especially over the last 5 years, I would say, there's high concentration of leading-edge technology across the value chain. But given the geopolitical situation, people are more aware of it and they start now thinking of self -- of levels of self-sufficiency that a couple of years ago, nobody bought up. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. . Was wondering if you could help us on the updated 2021 guidance. And I think last quarter, you had talked about there being potential upside from domestic China we hadn't seen any change in the geopolitical situation or export controls. So just curious, can you help us understand, is that now included, that upside included? And if so, how much is that? Yes. I think it's fair to say that, that upside is now included in the numbers that we've given. So it's clear, and peter went through that also in the presentation at the beginning of this call that we've revised upwards, if you like, the the outlook for the full year. And further down into the year, we've now said this is how we look at the full year. Of course, still expecting that the regulatory situation remains a little bit the way it is today. And therefore, what previously was upside. And the way we talked about upside has now really been included in that number. Remember, last time, the expectation that we gave was that could be about EUR 600 million upside coming from China, and that number is now included in the, let's say, close to EUR 18 billion that we've now talked about. And if you really want to think about the risk profile, you could say, well, when the regulatory situation changes and you could not ship to China. When you look at the market situation today, then -- which is quite different than 3 months ago, then we would ship those systems somewhere else. Great. And then just as a follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand the 2 systems that you repurchased from a customer, those were on the EUV side and then you plan to ship those this year. And I guess, is that -- if that's correct, is that embedded in the 30% EUV revenue growth? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. So you have a reversal in this quarter. And you will see it come back in the subsequent quarters. For the full year, it's neutral price. It's minus 2 and plus 2. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Peterc of Societe Generale. So you gave us a pretty clear outlook on EUV for '22. I just wondered about the longevity of this strong cycle do you see in emerging entry because that's where all of the upgrade today is coming for '21. So I'm just wondering is all of that then carrying into '22 as well. And then just very quickly, if you could also provide a quick comment on that on ASPs were again very strong in this quarter, so you put some things there. I'll do the -- Roger will do the ASPs. And your question on the -- on the sustainability, yes. And especially DPV and apps. I think I said it on as an answer on an earlier question, when we look at how we see the DPV market and the aftermarket today as compared to 3 years ago, 2018, I think we have a different view. And that's driven by the fact that, of course, our entire GPV portfolio, which is emulsion and dry, we have -- we cannot fulfill the demand of our customers all the time. And that has to do with the fact that our analysis shows that with the combination of, let's say, advanced sensing technology, 5G the ability to process all the data through high performance compute. And then in a distributed fashion, basically leading edge compute also goes to the edge. I call that distributed systems and the distributed system is, for instance, a car. But it's also one of our machines in the field. And then increasingly, requires collection of data, transport of data, processing of data, not only to the most advanced high-performance compute but as part of the distributed system. And that system, inevitably includes mature technology, which could be image sensors, power ICs, MEMS, analog solutions. It's the whole thing. And that means if we would have a high line system available today, it will be sold yesterday. So it's everywhere. And that has to do with the proliferation of chip technology and a distributed computing and distributed systems that we are seeing. That is something that will not go away in our minds. This is why I said also in my prepared remarks that we are also planning and looking into what is the level of our DPV capacity increase that we need, both in mature and in emerging. And is it going to be double-digit increase as from where we are today. Now how much can we stretch that or how much is needed. That's exactly what we're doing with EUV. We need to land up with the supply chain. And we need to go deeper into what it takes in terms of capacity lead time, do they need to build square leaders, so they need to hire people, it's going to be possible to cycle time reductions through process optimization. This is the work that we're doing today. Because remember, 5 months ago, we were looking at a completely different world. So this is a ramp-up, but we do believe that this has a long runway. Yes. On the ASP for EUV, it's well noted. You're absolutely right. So this quarter, in Q1, we're looking at an ASP for EUV of about $160 million. Part of that is configuration. We've talked about that in the past. If you look at the last 3 quarters, we've consistently been looking at at an ASP of around 1 45 and this time it's a little bit up for another reason I'll come to in a moment. So in fact, what you see is that -- in fact, in the last year, we've been positively surprised by the options on the 2 and the options that were ordered on the 2 as a result is that the consecration was richer than anticipated. And as a result of that, your fairly consistently see now that the as ranges above the 130 that we talked about in the past and it's fairly consistent. We've seen 1 45 or up. The reason that is extra of this this year, there's a few accounting things. We talked about accounting for for VPAs in the past. So there's a few accounting reasons why it's [indiscernible] higher to it 160 11 and 1 45. Reality, just looking at the configuration that we've seen on the tools in the past couple of quarters. The 1 45 tanker point, [indiscernible] for EUV is probably the right way to go. And I say that recognizing that this is about the last quarter that we're really looking at a large number of fees in the revenue. And our next question comes from the line of David Mulholland of UBS. Just coming back on the EUV capacity increase and shifting to 55 tool capacity for next year. Obviously, there were some changes made last year that ended up limiting what potentially should have been higher shipments this year and some of that probably kicks in next year. But in your discussions with customers, Peter, just -- obviously, there's a very, very strong cyclical tailwind for the industry today that's driving appetite for capacity increase. But the EUV is on a very, very long time horizon for customers 18 months rather than 6 months planning. How do you feel like their assumptions have changed that's driving that upside? Is it primarily because of their confidence and penetration of EUV in higher layers? Or is there an element of actually just building bigger nodes now that's driving the need for more capacity at this point? I think, David, it's both. I think we're seeing -- I only -- what I referred to as a comment that was made by the CEO of one of our large customers. And actually, man, you know we're going to double the number of layers on our next node. I think that's a trend that we are seeing. Simply because the advantages of EUV are not only, you could say, the pure economic cost per layer because you can eliminate multiple patterning. But it's also the electrical characteristics and the simplicity of the process, lower risk. That's 1 of them. So there's many other side effects that actually lead people to go for EUV. So yes, it's higher layer counts, that's what we're seeing, which is true for memory and for logic, but also when we talk to customers, we all talk about bigger nodes, it has to do with this secular trend. Trend #2 that I talked about. And that number -- trend number 3, the technological sovereignty, will just be a layer on top, which will not go away, which will take time. It takes 2 to 3 years to build this semiconductor factory and we put it into action. So -- but I think this is -- so it is bigger nodes. It is strategic investments. It's high lay accounts. And this is what I asked to a previous question, we only to take this into consideration. Some of it we already saw coming, but what does it mean? For our capacity needs beyond 2022, which, by the way, solve that capacity if that would be needed, would be the result of, like I said, process optimization, cycle time improvement,  [indiscernible] work schedules and potentially square and meters, that could be. But it's all of the above. And just one quick follow-up. Obviously, from a financial perspective, at some point in the near future, you need to start building those tools through the supply chain, given the lead times. Are you requiring customers to place deposits and make the financial commitments that you've been starting to make before any of those tools get built? Or is there an element still this year where you're going ahead and starting production before you've had firm deposit associated orders from the customer? Yes, David, the policy hasn't changed there. So that means that when customers put in a PO, a down payment is required. And I think we mentioned in the past that the amount of the deal is a little bit dependent on the moment or what the order is being paced. So the order is being placed nicely in line with the lead time, the down payment is lower than 1 has placed a little bit later than that. But you also know that the PO in and by itself is a bit of a non-event for us because we work so closely with the customer that we sort of understand what they're doing what they want and when they need it. So the CEO is a bit of a nonevent for us. But yes, the short answer is absolutely. There will be down payments to date at the moment of the [indiscernible] And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse at Evercore ISI. I guess first question, Peter, can you speak to the sustainability of memory? I think the headline above 50% might be a bit concerning. However, if I think about EUV in there as well as the strong pickup in EUV and voltage and contrast imaging. It certainly looks like Memory ex those 2 things is tracking more like up 20%, 25%. So I would love to hear your thoughts on the moving parts there. And how to think about sustainability into '22? Yes. I think for this year, it's not a surprise. I mean, you just need to go back to our conference calls the last 2 quarters. Where we actually saw a recovery of especially DRAM starting. And I think I gave some color 3 months ago where he basically said, we had a decent shipment core in Q4 of last year, which basically goes into production in Q1. But if you look at a bit growth of 20% this year, then our calculations show that we very quickly at the next output capacity of our DRAM customers in this year, and we would reach that pretty quick. So we need more capacity addition. That's exactly what we have seen. So I think it's just the beginning. These things -- so yes, I think, yes, it will move into next year. Now you've been around also long. So that -- in the memory business, yes, there is more tendency to have from time to time some overcapacity and some under capacity. How long that will last, I don't know. But still, this is -- [indiscernible] telling me. This secular trend, when there's such a high demand in logic, all this stuff doesn't only work we only logic. It also needs memory, yes? So it's going to be quite interesting to see how quickly the memory capacity will be added throughout this year, early next year. And what the underlying bit growth percentages will be. Now I think having said that, you notice also memory is more cyclical than logic, but nothing that indicates to me at this moment in time that we are looking at building an overcapacity. And there's nothing I can see at this moment in time. We're just starting. Very helpful. And then just a follow-up question on the EUV side of things. I think you guys have talked about growing your non EUV tool business by about 40%. So that's roughly $7.7 billion this year. Is there a way to frame how much capacity you're planning to add on the non-EUV side relative to that $7.7 billion for us to kind of gauge what you're capable above into '22 and beyond? Yes. It's -- I think we -- if we should calculate it the way that we would calculate but, for example, we would just be over it, about 8.2. And that's really stretching it. In terms of our production capacity this year. I would have more capacity, we could probably do more. Okay. Likely, we would be able to do more. So your question really is answered. In a sense that I already said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at increasing our BP capacity, both dry, mature and immersion and that's not going to be 5%. I mean, it's going to be double digit. But that will take some further analysis of what needs to be done. Is it through optimization? Things like process optimization and added workforce or cycle time action or has it to do with square meter capacity like factories. That is something that we as under consideration today, and we're looking into that and together with our supply chain. It's not so much for us. It is really in the supply chain. So the reason why I say this is because we believe that we need extra capacity. And it has to do with the underlying trends. The trends that I talked about earlier. So yes, the 40% rate bases to just over 8%, you have 7.7%, so you're a bit more conservative. But this is -- directionally, it is correct with. This is the answer. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Gardiner at Barclays. Another one, Peter, on the sort of capacity planning issues that you guys have been talking about. I'm wondering, given the changes that we've seen from a number of your lead customers or at least the public announcements from your lead customers over the last 3 or 4 months. And the fact that you are now having to rethink the need for additional capacity expansion, whether it's your site or within the supply chain. Are they now giving -- and I presume they're launching it sooner rather than later. It always seems to be the way. And yet you've got fairly extensive lead times, particularly so for EUV, perhaps slightly less so for DUV in terms of building out this capacity. Are you getting better visibility today in terms of what those customers are going to need looking out over the next 3, 4, 5 years in order to give you that confidence in making such a decision? Yes. It's a good question. I mean, also, you've been around also. I think all these people have been out for a long time. So that -- yes, when we underinvest, there's also going to be a knee jerk reaction, like it always happens. So this is is more the shorter-term correction of a MIS planning, that's happening today. That's what I call if the trend number one, but clearly, customers understanding that our capacity lead times in our manufacturing items are all. So they do share with us a longer-term vision. Now not 5 years out, that's a bit too much to ask. But certainly 2, 3 years out. So I mean, I would say, for 2022, 2023, we definitely have the discussions about what they need in terms of expansion plans in terms of what they see when we talk about logic, the anticipated capacity ramp in terms of the tape-outs that they have on the shelves that they see coming on and 5 and then the so it is not just some pie in the sky thinking. It is real underlying discussion that they have with their customers and their design requirements that they get from an increasing customer base, which has to do with high-power compute, there it AI and with all the applications that we talked about because of the whole digital transition. So yes, there's more visibility to the point that the planning visibility is, I would say, deeper. And this is also where we base our our request to the supply chain on, it's on that discussion. And which is going to be -- it's a costly discussion because you not add capacity for nothing. So this is and it is also true for our customers. It's going to be colo, but they've been very explicit to the outside world and to the media about what their plans are. And it's it's well thought through based on what they see for their customers and the customers of their customers tell them. So that's why I talk about these 3 trends. And this basically is the base for the visibility. But how much it in the end will be or we will need. There's always a risk of underestimation, but also risk of overestimation. And that's what we need to take into consideration when we say what's wise? And then like I said, this is just something of the last 3 or 4 months where it starts to accelerate, it gives us a bit of time and our supplies particularly to figure out what is with them. Thank you, Peter, for that insight, even if I think you did call me old at the outset there, I still appreciate that. It's all relative. And from my perspective, you are very young. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar of Cowen and Co. So let me ask you 2 quick questions. Clearly, a nice jump in EUV bookings in the March quarter. Can you give some color on how the EUV bookings are trending for the current quarter? And what is your EUV backlog in terms of units? And then I have a follow-up. I could take it. So in terms of order book, the current backlog is EUR 7.4 billion for EUV. So that's pretty strong and obviously also driven by significant intake in the last quarter. I'm not going to comment specifically on this quarter, but in general, just listening to the commentary that we made on our expectations on our [indiscernible]. It's pretty clear that also for the next quarters, we do expect a healthy order intake for EUVs because at this stage, EUR 7.4 billion. And if you do the math, what you think system business is going to be next year. If you translate that at the 55 capacity that we've been talking about, it's pretty clear that we're still looking at a significant order intake expected for the next -- for this quarter and for the next quarter. Got's it. Very helpful, Joe. And then just as a follow-up, Peter, you -- I know you gave some color on like the memory outlook for this year. Can you just give little more insight in terms of how to think between DRAM and NAND in the context of a memory growth of 50% for this year? Yes. I think we -- I think we also -- it's an extension of what we said in the previous 2 quarters. It is primarily driven by DRAM. But we also see that 3D NAND will follow. I mean, what we see is  basically following the utilization of our tools in the field. That will follow. But it is primarily driven this quarter, next quarter. And I think the majority of [indiscernible] DRAM. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Duval at Goldman Sachs. . Just have a quick question on you gross margin. So we expected trajectory there in the gross margin stolen this year to be at good gross margin levels. I wonder if you could just talk through the drivers of improvement as we go to the end of the year. Then new reference related to this, that you're seeing higher ASPs related to a particular area the CMO. I was just wondering to the extent that we see an expected ASPs on the DMO could atone the gross margin [indiscernible] Yes. Like at the beginning, you were a little bit tough to understand, but I think your question really was, how do you expect the gross margin to further develop on EUV. And as we mentioned before, we do expect in the second half with the introduction of the D model, we expect EUV system gross margin to be at the level of the corporate gross margin. So -- and I can confirm that that's exactly what's going on. You are right that we did see a little bit of a reset on the ASP for the C model, right? So we've been talking about 1 30. But as I mentioned, the configuration quarter after quarter turned out to be richer than we previously anticipated. And I think it's fair to say that the 10% to 15% uptick that we've been talking about on the -- for the demo in comparison to the C model, still hope, right? So if you take the the 145-ish basis for the C model, then I think a low low TAM increase over that in terms of a probably what you should be looking at for the ad calculation. And of course, to the extent that, that is better, that, of course, is also helpful a little bit on the gross margin side as well. Although the D has also somewhat higher cost. So it's 100% to the bottom line that we have some higher cost on the optics and also other parts correct. But it will help. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Harchandani of Citi. I'm Amit Harchandani from Citi. My first question is on the topic of DTV. If I try to collect all the data points you've shared with us is it fair for me to say you would expect DPV sales to be up year-on-year in 2022, given that you are just getting started in memory and cyclicality trend could persist into 2022. And as a follow-up to that, if I may, you've talked about building capacity for detailing. You are stretched at EUR 8 billion. And you talked about double digit, I think earlier in the call, is it fair to say that you would expect this EUR 8 billion to be exceeded or basically even a higher contribution from DTV, if not in 2022, then certainly beyond 2020? Yes. You've listened carefully, Amit, and that is true. Everything you just said, do we expect difficult sales to be up year-on-year I don't know about the year that you are imagined, but the fact that we are looking into increasing our DPV capacity means that we believe DPV sales will be up and in what year and is year-on-year. But I think into the long term, we have, indeed, reassessed the need for DPV capacity going forward. And when you talk about capacity increase, you don't do this for 1 year. You do this because you feel medium to long-term that is needed. So yes, and it also means that if we do that, then -- and we say we'll be around EUR 8 billion this year on DPV, yes, that we would expect that, that would increase because otherwise, you don't need to build capacity because we could do with what we have today. Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And secondly, very quickly on on geopolitics. We've heard a lot of noise. Based on what you have said today, it seems like you expect the whole geopolitical dynamic to be a net positive. It may be some downside risk to China potentially being offset by potential upside in Europe and the U.S. Is that a fair assessment? Or more broadly, what are the latest -- what is the latest in your view versus what you shared at the end of January? Yes. I think Roger said it, is that I think we are now where we are because we're through Q1, we're in Q2 now, we have included that EUR 600 million upside into the number that we gave you. However, we don't control the geopolitical situation and the lawmaking. But given the market situation where we are today, if some of that EUR 600 million would not be there because of geopolitical roadblocks, then the demand is such that we will ship those systems somewhere else. And if you then look at how that affects shipments to China versus the longer-term geopolitical impact. It's just a matter of timing, yes? That's --  the first one could be short-term this year, the others are definitely long-term because when you -- they all -- it is all about where do we build a new fab well, it takes 2 to 3 years. So when you really look at adding capacity at the time frame, 24, 25. Is that capacity starts coming to the market. So it's all -- that's all matter of different timing, a different time perspective. All right. We have time for 1 last quick question. So if you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact ASML Investor Relations department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller, please. That is the line of Didier Scemama of Bank of America. I think the most important question was just asked and answered, so thank you. I wanted to ask you question about installed base management for EUV, Peter, if you would like to really share with us what do you think the sort of revenues could be for EUV installed base this year? And how you're thinking about the slope of growth over the coming 5 years, the sort of things. So we have a feel for the change in the mix towards the sort of more recurring revenues in installed base, that would be great. Yes. So on the more recurring side, I think what we've said in the past is that the way to model that for EUV is to take the ASP of a 2 and take about 6% of that. And that's when the tool is up and running at I envisage capacity, then you would have 6% of that ASP as the recurring revenue for service and maintenance for that tool. So that excludes upgrades, but just for the regular sort of a maintenance, 6% of the APE is what you would see there. So again, the assumption to needs to be up and running at the visit capacity, and it should be out of warranty. As long as food is important, the number is a bit lower. So that's really the way to model it. As it comes to upgrades, that's a little bit more difficult right, because upgrade is lumpy, upgrade is dependent on what the customer wants in terms of productivity gains. What they want to make available to us in terms of the machine plan. So that's a little bit harder to predict. But at least on the regular service and maintenance side, this is the way to model the 6% [indiscernible] up and running and out of warranty. Before we sign off, I'd like to remind you that our Investor Day will be September 29, 2021. The event is currently planned to be held in London. We move the date from June and hope we can have a face-to-face meeting at the time, but of course, this will depend on the progress against the virus. More details will follow in due time. And we do hope you'll be able to join us. Now on behalf of ASML, I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes the ASML 2021 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",a transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on asml.com shortly following the conclusion of this call . Roger and I would like to provide an overview on some commentary on this quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters .,1.0
2021-07-21,21,7,2021,663.2266235351562,0.11201502293607324,0.0,0.9997,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2021,"Mr. Wennink, can you give us a summary of the Q2 results? Yes. Our Q2 results were very good. And as we indicated last quarter, we ended the second quarter with a sales number of EUR 4 billion, where we have to remind ourselves that, that EUR 4 billion may look a bit low as compared to the first quarter and a bit low as compared to our guidance for the third quarter. And we need to remember that in the second quarter we shipped a number of machines without what we call a factory acceptance test. So basically the revenue falls in the next quarter for revenue recognition purposes. It's about a EUR 300 million shift, yes, from Q2 to Q3, but it was a good quarter.And gross margin, 50.9%, is above guidance. It was driven largely by we're selling more software upgrades. I mean customers are looking for more productivity, but also there's a onetime release of some deferred revenue, which was an accounting release.So installed based business, EUR 1.1 billion, also good. EUR 1 billion of net profit.I mean I think most noticeable, I think, in the second quarter was the order intake, EUR 8.3 billion. I think it's the highest quarterly order intake we've ever seen, with EUR 4.9 billion for EUV, so pretty good. What's at present your overall view for 2021? 2021 -- it may not be a surprise. I mean it's going to be a very strong year. And we -- as a quarter ago, we guided about a 30% increase, as compared to last year. And I think now we're at 35%. So everybody is working extremely hard, us and our suppliers, to actually produce a bit more machines because our customers are craving for those machines. So I think it's good.If we then look at the segments. Logic, no surprise either, driven by everything that we see around us. It's the drive for artificial intelligence, high-power compute drive the desire or the demand for leading-edge chips, but it's not only that. I mean, when we think about the current market situation, you actually see that what we call the distributed systems, which are being supported by 5G, are growing so fast. And you have to think about what's a distributed system. I mean it's a car. It's an industrial machine. It's a home appliance. It's the working-from-home PCs. Those are all distributed systems that actually don't all need 5 nanometer or 7 nanometer. But they need compute power to assist the sensor, a lot of sensing happening in all these distributed systems. And that's matured, so it's not only advanced logic, but now we also see mature logic. And this is the reason why we think Logic will increase with about 35% this year, as compared to our previous estimate last quarter of about 30%.It's the same for Memory. Memory follows Logic. And for Memory, last quarter, we said we think this year it will grow with about 50%. Now we think it's 60%. It's about EUR 4.7 billion in sales this year, Memory, of which EUR 1 billion is going to be EUV. And that's important because EUV doesn't really add yet to the bit capacity this year, yes. So basically it's technology investments that our customers are doing for ramping next year and the year thereafter. And on installed base, we thought 10% growth last quarter. We now think 15% growth, also driven by the software and productivity upgrades that our customers are looking for. So all in all, 2021 is going to be a very good year, 35% growth. What about demand beyond 2021? That's a good question. I think clearly we've seen in 2021 also the -- we could say, the reaction of the industry at large, the electronic industry, to the COVID year. So you saw, you can say, a catch-up effect. I think that will stretch into 2022, yes. Some of the supply chains have been disrupted and it takes a bit longer, but longer term, it's what I said earlier. I said it is really the driver, advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence; high-power compute; and the demand for matured systems which are driven by what we call the intelligence edge, all these distributed systems that need a level of compute, yes, next to the sensors, yes. And that is a secular trend that will not go away very soon. Actually, we think it will continue throughout the rest of the decade.And then there's a third trend which is more that, you could say, the trend for technological sovereignty; that the big geographical areas in the world, like the United States and Europe, feel that part of that big growth that's coming should also be local. So -- and it's not a surprise then if you look at those trends and look at our order book. And our order book is currently about EUR 17.5 billion in sales of -- as a very significant part is EUV, yes. That order book is very strong, yes. And that's where it's just a reflection of where we currently are, and it's a look into 2022. I mean we'd even think that -- for instance, our EUV capacity next year, which we think will be around 55 units. When we look at the order book, about 80% is already booked as at the end of Q2 2021. So yes, I think, all in all, significant growth expected in the next couple years. Can you update us further on your capacity plans for EUV, for deep UV? If you listened to my previous answers: I mean it's going to be growth. And I -- and we strongly believe that, that growth cannot be supported by the capacity that we currently have, so we need to extend capacity. Now how do you extend capacity? There are 3 ways to extend capacity. First is, of course, do things faster, cycle time reduction. That's generally something you can do within 6 [ and ] 12 months. Secondly, you can add to the same square meters. You can add more people and more machines, which basically has an output time of about 12 to 18 months. And when that's not enough, you need to build. You need to build square meters, which is 2 to 3 years. So I think this is what we are discussing together now with our supply chain.So on deep UV, we will significantly increase our capacity, will be significantly double digit. How much in the end it will be still depends on the final confirmation we get out of the supply chain on those 3 things: cycle time reduction, adding more people and machines and building square meters. We -- I think, in the third quarter or the end -- towards the end of the third quarter, we'll have a pretty good view of what that means.On EUV, we said the capacity for next year, 2022, is 55 units, but for '23, we are now looking in to bring that capacity over 60 units. When we look at the longer-term demand, we'll be over 60 units. And then you have to also realize, when you think about EUV, that customers buy machines, but in fact they buy wafer capacity. So if -- the new machines, like the 3600D that has a 15% to 20% higher productivity, yes. Also the newer generations add more capacity in terms of wafers out because the machines are so much more productive. Moving forward, what can you say about your capital allocation? Well, capital allocation. Looking at the forecast, our growth profile, the profitability profile of the company, we'll be generating a sufficient amount of cash. And we will distribute that according to our financial policy. First of all, we will use the cash to grow the business, yes, to support R&D growth; to support the fixed assets, building parts of the factory, building the -- building out factories, buying machines, which is also true for our supply chain. We will fund some of that in the supply chain like we've always done. And when we've done that, we'll give it back to the shareholders. I mean we'll pay an increasing dividend and we will do share buybacks. And on those share buybacks, as you know, we have a program which is EUR 6 billion, which by the way, we bought back EUR 5.2 billion of that EUR 6 billion. So there's a remainder of EUR 800 million. We will basically bring it into a new program. So the EUR 800 million will be brought into a new program of EUR 9 billion, which the term of that program will be focused on executing it by or potentially even before December 31, 2023. So all in all, to summarize, the future for ASML looks bright. I think the future for the industry looks bright. And I think it's clear that, industry analysts, our customers and us, we believe that our customers -- I'm talking about the semiconductor industry, so the semiconductor makers. They currently have a combined sales number of about $500 billion. That could be $1 trillion by the end of this decade. So we talk about doubling the sales, which actually means that we need to [ add ] that capacity. We need to help our customers in their expansion plans. When they build fabs, we will ship the equipment. And it's all driven by basically what we're seeing today, which is the digital revolution, yes. It's the further rollout of 5G and 6G. It's the progress we're making on artificial intelligence, self-driving cars. It's the intelligence edge that will actually drive a significant part of that growth. So all in all, we're very positive about the future. And we'd love to tell you a little bit more when we have our Capital Markets Day September 29 of this year, and I'm looking forward to that.","we ended the second quarter with a sales number of EUR 4 billion . we have to remind ourselves that, this is a bit low as compared to the first quarter . the revenue falls in the next quarter for revenue recognition purposes . it's about a EUR 300 million shift from Q2 to Q3 .",1.0
2022-01-19,19,1,2022,695.2601928710938,0.048299582976918165,0.0,0.9997,Earnings Call Transcript Q4-2021,"Mr. Wennink, can you give us a summary of the fourth quarter and the full year results in 2021? Yes. Both were very good to start with Q4, with about EUR 5 billion of sales. That's in the midpoint of our guidance. Our deep UV shipments were a bit light. I think they were basically the result of the effects of the logistics center and supply chain issues that we announced in Q3. But that was compensated, fully compensated by EUV revenue, and by our Installed Base revenue and especially the productivity upgrades, they were able to ship to our customers. Our customer are in bad need of extra capacity. So there was a big demand, and we were able to ship. So that was good for the full year. About 35% higher than 2020, ending at EUR 18.6 billion of sales, which was good. Installed Base management was very good, like I said earlier, EUR 1.5 billion of sales, driven by productivity enhancement packages as we call them, Installed Base options to give our customers extra wafer capacity. For the total year, about EUR 5 billion. That's about a 27% increase -- or sorry, 27% of our total sales. On the gross margin, now because of the productivity enhancement packages, which is our software, very good gross margin, just over 54% in Q4. And for the total year, again, a record 52.7%. Net income as a result of that good, EUR 1.8 billion in Q4, EUR 5.9 billion for the total year. And I think if you look at the year and you want to reflect on the year, I think you also need to look at the order intake. Now order intake in Q4 was high, EUR 7.1 billion, of, you could say, only EUR 2.6 billion in EUV, but we've had very strong EUV order intake throughout the year, which includes one High-NA tool. And that means that we have EUR 4.6 billion of deep UV orders in Q4. And just a reflection of where the market is today, I mean there's a significant demand for our entire product portfolio, both DPV and EUV mature and advanced. Over EUR 26 billion of order intake throughout 2021 with just under half EUV, and the other half is deep UV. And just the reflection, again, of this very widespread demand for our products across all technologies, our entire product portfolio. So in summary, both Q4 and 2021, very good year. When we look at the beginning of this year, your revenue guidance for Q1 is quite low. What's the reason for that? Yes, I can understand the question. And as a matter of fact, it's not at all as bad as it appears. It's got to do with revenue recognition. And basically, it's driven by the fact that we want to reduce cycle time. The shorter the cycle time is the more we can ship to our customers. Now what we used to do is to recognize revenue when we accept our systems, the sign-up of the systems in our factory. That actually -- that acceptance procedure takes a couple of weeks, sometimes 3 to 4 weeks. We actually skip that and we ship the system to the customer side, and we do the acceptance test there. Projection mean there's only 1 acceptance test, and that's at the customer side. So it means you defer or you delay the revenue. Now if you then look at the planned shipments for this quarter, just the sales value of those shipments is anywhere between EUR 5.3 billion and EUR 5.5 billion, which is a very high number. Now, and if you then take into account that we had some fast shipments as we call them in Q4 of last year, so we will recognize about EUR 300 million in Q1 of 2022, but we're also deferring or shifting about EUR 2 billion of revenue into the next quarters of 2022. So if you take the combined effect, it's all about revenue recognition. The -- I would say the booked revenue of those shipments in Q1 is then between EUR 3.3 billion and EUR 3.5 billion, with about 49% gross margin. That explains Q1. What I asked, your expectations for the full year 2022? 2022 is going to be a good year. We expect about 20% growth as compared to 2021, which is a good number because you have to take into account that we also plan for fast shipments by the end of this year. So you remember, revenue will shift into 2023. We think we currently think about 6 EUV systems will be fast shipped as we call it. And if you take that into account, if you would add those delayed revenues on to the 20%, then the growth of the shipment value will be about 25%, not 20%, but the recorded revenue, as we call it, will be about 20% growth. You're operating in a very high demand environment at the moment. It's all about supply, all about maximizing output. What are your expectations with regard to EUV to deep UV for this year? I think on the EUV, we've said it before, we still have an expectation to ship about 55 EUV systems. But like I said before, about -- we currently also expect to fast ship about 6 systems for which the revenue will move into 2023. So we ship 55, about 6 will be revenue recognized in 2023. Well, with that, the combined effect of that will mean an EUV growth -- revenue growth of about 25%. On deep UV, we've seen -- also when you look at the order intake, deep UV is particularly strong. It's across all industries. Memory, Logic, very strong deep UV demand driven by the chip shortage that everybody knows about. We will probably see about a 20% growth of our deep UV business in 2022 as compared to 2021. And on Installed Base, despite the fact that we had a very strong year in 2021 and with many pull-ins of Installed Base options to increase more wafer capacity, we still expect 2022 to grow about 10%. How does it all translate into your different market segments for this year? Yes. I think both Memory and Logic, given the demand situation, which exceeds our capacity, it's not a surprise that also Logic will be very strong, driven by the underlying secular trend of the increased demand for more mature products for advanced products, Logic will grow about 20%. And also on Memory, DRAM specifically, very high utilization. So there's not much space left in terms of extra wafer capacity because our system utilization is very high. The expectation is that the bit growth in DRAM will be high teens. Well, there's only one way to get those extra bits out and at least to basically ship more systems, so increased wafer capacity. So we expect memory growth as compared to 2021 this year to be about 25%. It all sounds that also 2022 will be a very good year for ASML. What challenges are you facing at present? Yes. I think the biggest challenge that we currently see is that the demand significantly exceeds our capacity. I think it's unprecedented. I have never seen this before. And I think it has to do with a couple of things. I think it is the secular growth trend. I think it's the drive for more semiconductors to support Internet of Things. It's the disturbances as a result of COVID, all the reasons why the demand is so much higher than our capacity. And that means if you're at maximum capacity that you have to be very careful and very much monitoring any disturbances because you know if there's a disturbance, you don't have any buffer left because you're at maximum capacity. So I think there are 3 things that we are really looking at: #1 is COVID. Clearly, COVID, we cannot predict it, but it's still there. Infection rates around the globe are shooting up, and it will inevitably also lead to some absenteeism that we have. I don't think people get infected in a clean room, but the infections happen at home, but still, it will affect you; secondly, I think it's the supply chain. I think there are disturbances. You just open the papers. There are shortages and supply-demand imbalances everywhere. I think we need to manage that very closely; and third, I think it's the workforce. We are ramping our capacity significantly, which also means people. I mean, we hired close to 6,000 people in 2021. But those people need to be trained. They need to get up the learning curve, and that will take time. What are you doing to address these challenges? Yes. I think 3 things, I think, with our customers. It's all about getting wafers out there, more wafer output. And this is why we've turned into fast shipments, turned to fast shipments to basically say, if you can reduce the cycle time, but not doing acceptance test for weeks in our factory and just basically emptying the production cabin 3, 4 weeks earlier, you can output more systems. So that's what we're doing. So together with our customers, we've taken the decision to do fast shipments. And next to that, it's Installed Base improvements, hardware, software options to get more wafers out. That's what you do together with your customers. It leads to delay of revenue, but it's not a problem because that will easily be catched up 1 or 2 quarters later. And then with our suppliers. There are supply disturbances, not only in the semiconductor industry, they're everywhere. So what do you do? You stay on top of each other, basically very closely monitoring everything that goes on so any disturbances are recognized soon. And then you take action and corrective measures to do that. So it means a very close collaboration between the supplier base and ASML. And the last one, COVID. We have all the protective measures in our factories and in the company. But still, it's a pandemic. And like I said, most infections happen in the private space and will also happen to us. So this is something which we have to monitor very closely, and see how we can basically support our output with flexible working schedules. On top of this, you started the new year with a fire at ASML Berlin. What's the current status? Yes. It wasn't a good start of the year, clearly. The fire happened in 1 part of the factories. There are several buildings there. We were able to put the fire out within a couple of hours, but still there was a significant damage. Now I must say kudos to the ASML Berlin people and the people here in Veldhoven and in Wilton. They had a lot of creativity. We are where we are today, which is for deep UV, although there were some initial disturbances, we don't think there's going to be any impact on our output for 2022. But in the -- where the fire happened was in the area where we make the EUV wafer clamp, which is a very complex, but a very significant module that goes into our EUV systems. But because of the hard work and the creativity and we currently believe that we can manage the situation and that we will not see a significant impact on our EUV output in the year 2022. Can you give us an update on your EUV High-NA? Yes. High-NA is the next big promise. Well, it's moved beyond a promise, I think, we're executing. We're executing the first High-NA tools in our factory. We received the fifth EXE, that's the High-NA EXE:5000 order for shipment, basically ship it up to and including 2024, if not 5 in the order book. And as a matter of fact, in Q1 of this year, so it's not last year in Q1 of 2022, we received the first order for the EXE:5200, so the 5200, which is the next-generation high-volume manufacturing tool for EUV, which will be launched in 2024, but it will have improved lithographic performance and higher productivity. So that's the promise for the second half of this decade in terms of high-volume manufacturing. Let's have a look at your capital allocation. Your dividend increase is quite large. Can you re-elaborate? Yes. Let's be clear about the capital allocation policy. First, we will use our free cash flow to support the business. We will invest significantly in our capacity, our capacity in the supply chain. We will invest significantly in R&D, given the high growth profile that we have. But when we're done, yes, we'll pay a dividend. We pay a growing dividend. And we will propose to the general meeting of shareholders to increase the dividend to EUR 5.50. That's a total dividend for the year 2021, for which, of course, we paid an interim dividend in Q4 of 2021. So that's a significant increase in dividend. And next to that, we keep doing share buybacks. We basically ended to the previous program by buying back EUR 4 billion. This is the last part of the previous program. And then we started a new program, which we announced last year. It's a EUR 9 billion program, which we already bought back about EUR 4.6 billion. To close off, do you expect strong demand to continue beyond 2022? Absolutely. I think I said it before, we're looking at this secular growth trend. And we talked about this extensively during our Capital Markets Day last year -- at the end of last year. The growth profile of this industry is impressive. The semiconductor industry is planned to double in size to $1 trillion by the end of this decade. And of course, this also will have an effect on our business. So what do we do? And I have to admit, I think we, as an industry, us and our customers and their customers, we've underestimated the long-term growth profile of the company. So we need to catch up.And how we do that? We build capacity. And that's where we're very much focusing on building capacity at ASML, but also in the supply chain to make sure that we can significantly increase our output, both for deep UV and for EUV and for our metrology and measurement systems, basically across our entire product line. So bearing that in mind, we're even more optimistic about the long-term growth profile of this company.","our deep UV shipments were a bit light . but that was compensated, fully compensated by EUV revenue . we were able to ship to our customers, which was good for the full year .",0.0
2022-04-20,20,4,2022,599.9188232421875,-0.13713048813450945,0.0,0.9997,Earnings Call Transcript Q1-2022,"Mr. Dassen, can you give us a summary of the first quarter results? Sure. We recorded net sales of EUR 3.5 billion. Included in that EUR 3.5 billion was the revenue for 3 EUV systems. We shipped 9 EUV systems in the quarter. And the delta, obviously, is related to the effect of the fast shipment process that we extensively talked about in the last quarter. Also included in the EUR 3.5 billion is EUR 1.2 billion for installed base revenue, which is -- which was as guided. We also recorded a gross margin of 49%, once again as guided. What that led to net income for the quarter of EUR 695 million.
In terms of bookings, we're looking at net bookings for Q1 of EUR 7 billion, of which EUR 2.5 billion for EUV. And in that number, there was also multiple High-NA orders included in there. So yes, all in all, I think a good quarter and the financial results delivered as guided. What's your guidance for the second quarter? For revenue, we are guiding EUR 5.1 billion to EUR 5.3 billion, and that excludes EUR 800 million of net delayed revenue for Q2. And that is the result of the fact that we expect more fast shipments at the end of Q2 than we had at the end of Q1. EUR 1.2 billion, again expected and guided as the Installed Base revenue for Q2. We're expecting a gross margin between 49% and 50%. That's a little higher than we had in Q1.
On the one hand, it benefits from higher volume, both for DUV and EUV. But on the other hand, we are expecting slightly lower ASPs for EUV. The ASP for EUV was very high in Q1. We expect that to be a little bit lower. And also, we expect a slightly negative mix effect from a gross margin perspective because we expect a bit more dry business relatively speaking, so between 49% and 50%. Do you foresee any changes to your revenue outlook for the full year? For the full year, I think, demand is very, very strong as evidenced by the order intake that I just talked about and also the order book. So the demand outlook is very strong. So once again, as we said in Q1, this year will be very much supply constrained. And on the supply side, we're working very, very hard to navigate all the supply chain issues that everyone is dealing with our industry to the entire industry. But we're working very, very hard to navigate that. So in light of that, we still expect revenue to be up around 20% for 2022 in comparison to 2021.
And if you then look at the different products and different businesses. On the EUV side, we expect to ship 55 EUV systems. We won't get revenue for all of those 55 systems because we are expecting quite a few EUV systems to be fast shipped at the end of -- or in Q4 at the end of the year. So not all of the revenue for those 55 systems will be recognized this year. Some of that will be recognized in 2023. But still, also in light of that, we still expect that EUV revenue for the year will go up approximately 25%.
And if we then look at the non-EUV business, we expect that to go up a bit more than 20% in comparison to 2021, which is driven both by immersion, by dry and also by metrology systems. So yes, that's the outlook, if you like, for the different products. If you then look at the different businesses, it is, again, as we said in the last quarter. So that means that the Installed Base business will be up approximately 10%. The Memory business will be up. We expect around 25% and the Logic business, we expect to be up more than 20%. How about the gross margin for the full year and the impact of increased costs? Yes, good question. So maybe to remind people of what we said in the last quarter. So last quarter, we articulated an expectation of around 53% in terms of gross margin, which was a little bit up from last year. And going into the moving parts that we discussed then at that point in time, we said we expect the gross margin on the Installed Base revenue business to be a little bit lower because last year, we had a very, very high level of software business, and there, we expect that to be a bit lower this year. So that's why we expect the gross margin on the Installed Base business to be a bit lower.
We expect that the gross margin on EUV to be higher. And that is primarily driven by the fact that all of the systems that we're going to ship this year will be 3600s. So last year, we had a mix of 3600 and 3400. So that will be positive. It's a little bit offset by the fact that we expect the High-NA cost to be a little bit higher this year. So that takes the gross margin down a little bit.
And then on the DUV side, we expected it to be more or less in line with where we were last year because the mix that we're looking at for this year will be more or less comparable to the mix between immersion and dry that we had last year. So that was what we said -- that was what we said in Q1. So those are the moving parts. Then exactly to your point in terms of expectations around cost and around inflation. If you look at the different categories, there are 4 categories there that I think we need to look at.
On the one hand, of course, there is the labor cost. And there's 2 things happening there. On the one hand, we're going to talk about that a little bit later. We're really adding people. We're adding people because we are looking at an accelerated growth of our capacity, if you like. So we're adding people to get them trained, et cetera, et cetera. So the people are there, but they're not yet productive because they need to be trained and productivity obviously lags out a little bit. So that's one element of cost increase.
The second element particularly for a company that is taking so many talent out of the market because of our growth, we are experiencing quite some competition in the labor market. And of course, that's a bit regional. It's very, very high, I would say, the competition is very, very strong on the labor market in Asia, in Silicon Valley. But all in all, if you add all of that up, there is some cost increase on the labor cost side. So that's the first element.
Second element, of course, is on the component side. And there, we do have, with a number of suppliers, we do see some price increases in the components. And we also have some costs, some incremental costs, if you like, from service fees, if you like, to secure parts that are in short supply and very high demand. So that's the second category.
The third category is freight. Freight costs are going up substantially. That's as a result of the increase in fuel prices. I think everyone will recognize but also pretty specific to us because of so many freight movements going into Asia with all the corridors that are being changed as a result of the situation around the Ukraine. Of course, that means that also there, the freight costs are going up as a result of those changes in corridors.
And then the fourth element is, in general, increase in energy prices. It doesn't affect us all that much, to be honest, at least not directly because first off, we have, of course, longer-term contracts. And secondly, to a very large extent, we are relying on renewables, on renewable energy. So that part is not affecting us very strongly directly. But those are the 4 elements in terms of cost increase.
If I were to quantify that, I think, all in all, we might be looking this year at about a 1% incremental impact on the gross margin. So I think it's safe to say that rather than the 53%, I think what we're looking at right now, taking into consideration all these effects, I think it's more moving towards 52% for this year in terms of overall gross margin.
If you then do the calculation, so I gave you the results for Q1, I gave you the expectation for Q2. That means that you're looking at approximately 54% expectation for gross margin in the second half. And I would say that is primarily driven by volume. So we expect the volume obviously to go up in the second half, and that will drive both on the EUV side and on the DPV side that will drive the gross margin. And also, we believe that the gross margin on Installed Base in the second half is going to be more favorable than what we saw in the first half, just as a result of the composition of the different components within the Installed Base revenue. Let's have a look at EUV High-NA. You have received more orders from customers this quarter. Where are you at present with EUV High-NA? Yes. So I would say on the technology side, there's a lot going on. For people here in Veldhoven, it's very plain to see. We are building up the first system in our new fab here in Veldhoven. So that's cool, and that is -- that progress is going according to plan. And also to your point on the commercial side, multiple orders taken in Q1. But also, as a matter of fact, in this month, in April, we also have multiple orders for High-NA.
So if you look at the current order situation, we have orders for High-NA from 3 customers in logic and from 2 customers in -- on the memory side. So if you look at it, I would say, both on the technical side but also on the commercial side, really good progress being made on High-NA. We're looking at a strong demand. Do you expect the strong demand to continue beyond 2022? To be honest, I think everything we said in the Capital Markets Day and also in the recent call still holds true, right? So I think the overall picture of very, very strong demand that continues to go on. And as we said, that's premised on 2 main drivers: first, it's the secular driver. It's the secular growth that we see around the broader and broader application of semiconductors in many different industries and products. So that's the main driver, I would say. And we continue to see that develop very favorably.
And then secondly, as we also discussed, it's this whole trend around technological sovereignty. And you really now see that many of our customers are becoming more and more firm, more and more concrete in the plans that they have for building fabs across the globe. And that's really manifesting itself and that is going to lead to incremental demand for our products in the years to come. And lastly, I would say, once again, look at the order book, right? So we're looking at an order book of EUR 29 billion for this -- at the end of Q1. And again, also for this quarter, I expect some pretty healthy order intake yet again.
And then if you just mirror that EUR 29 billion against EUR 17 billion of system sales that we expect to see for this year, that just gives you an indication of how very, very strong order intake is and how very much covered we already are for 2023. So for us, in spite of the macro challenges that, of course, are all around this, we continue to see very, very strong demand and are very positive about also the period beyond 2022. You mentioned last quarter that you're looking to increase your capacity, where are you at present? Can you give us an update? Yes. So it's twofold. On the one hand, we're already very actively working both us and with the supply chain to just increase capacity. And you might recall, when we had the Capital Markets Day last year, we talked about increasing capacity towards 2020 with 1.5x for DUV. So that gets you to approximately 375 DUV systems capacity by '25. And we're doubling capacity in comparison to 2020 for EUV. So 2x, and that would get you to more than 70 EUV systems by 2025. So that was what we already told you at the Capital Markets Day last year, and we're executing on that.
We are, the supply chain is, et cetera. But to be honest, in light of everything that's going on, in light of the very, very strong demand that is out there and also in light of the fact that the data points are becoming clearer and clearer that we're really looking at a semiconductor market that is going to double during this decade by 2030. Just in light of all of those data points, we really said we need to push down the accelerator even further. And that's also what we said on the call last quarter. We said we need to -- we're looking at further increase in that.
So what we're doing right now is really we're looking at the feasibility of increasing capacity even beyond the points that I just gave you. And to be very concrete, what we're looking at is, is it feasible both for ourselves and for the supply chain to get to a capacity for EUV by 2025, low-NA EUV by 2025 of 90 units, and DUV, 600 units. That's what we're looking at for 2025. And for the medium term, we're also looking at 20 units for High-NA. So that's, in fact, the exam question that we now have, both for ourselves and for the supply chain, can we do this? Can we make that happen by 2025 and for High-NA in the medium term?
So we're going through the process right now. We had a very extensive dialogue with all the suppliers to just see whether that's happening, and they're very active to see can we pull that off. And we expect the results of that, I would say, in the second half of this year. And once we have that and once they have done their homework to test whether and under what circumstance that can be done. And we've done the same on our end because, of course, that would also mean that we would have to build incremental clean room here for us.
Once all of that is done, then we're going to translate that into updated scenarios for 2025 and also updated growth projections beyond 2025. Because I gave you the capacity numbers that we're working towards for 2025. Of course, that doesn't automatically translate into sales numbers for 2025. That's pretty obvious. This is the objective. This is the goal that we have for capacity. Once we know that's feasible, we're just going to look at what updated 2025 scenarios and growth expectations beyond 2025 are going hand-in-hand with that new plan.
Once we have that established in the second half of this year, we would like to give an update, and we would like to, in essence, in Q4, we're targeting a new Investor Day in which we would then give these updated scenarios and share that with the financial community. So yes, all in all, I mean, while on the geopolitical front, of course, these are tough times and challenging times, to be honest, for our industry, given all the dynamics that we talked about, given the strength of the order book that we see, it's actually a pretty exciting time.
And from that vantage point, just recognizing that growth, recognizing the positive dynamics that we see within our industry. Our confidence in the growth trajectory that we see for ourselves is going from strength to strength.","we recorded net sales of EUR 3.5 billion, including the revenue for 3 EUV systems . we also recorded a gross margin of 49%, once again as guided . for revenue, we are guiding EUR 5.1 billion to EUR 5.3 billion .",1.0
2022-07-20,20,7,2022,488.0260314941406,-0.18651322047762398,0.0,0.9994,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2022,"Mr. Wennink, can you give us a quick summary of the second quarter results? Yes, of course. Second quarter ended EUR 5.4 billion in sales and about EUR 1.3 billion in Installed Base, which is slightly ahead of our guidance. We had gross margin coming in at 49.1%, which is a bit of a lower end of the guidance, just to do with the increased inflationary effects that we've seen. Net income, EUR 1.4 billion. And very good order intake, EUR 8.5 billion of orders, which is a quarterly record.
Now all in all, I think a solid quarter. However, it was not without challenges and mainly because of supply chain challenges, supply chain constraints, parts not coming in on time, but we managed the quarter. What's your guidance for the third quarter? Well, like I said, what we saw in the second quarter, which is basically an acceleration of supply chain constraints, is actually also happening in Q3. And I think it will happen throughout the remainder of the year, which will mean that in the third quarter, we will see more fast shipments than we planned, and this shall also be true throughout the remainder of the year.
Now we have to remind what the fast shipment is, and the fast shipment is, in fact, a way to reduce the cycle time by cutting or not doing certain tests in our factory, which could lead up to 1 month of cycle time reduction, very important when the customers are waiting for those machines. So we only do those tests at the customer site, and which means the revenue recognition will, as we move to that moment in time, which means, yes, we will have more fast shipments, so we'll have more deferred revenue than we anticipated.
So when we look at Q3 and look at the guidance of Q3, I would say that it's more or less in line with the guidance that we gave for Q2. So it's between EUR 5.1 billion, EUR 5.4 billion of sales, between 49% and 50% margin and about EUR 1.4 billion of Installed Base Management. So are there then any changes to your fuel for 2022? Well, first of all, 2022, we have to put this into context. 2022, the demand is still significantly higher than what we can make. So this is the situation that the last quarter and is still the same, and we don't see any demand reduction. But what we do see is what I said earlier is that shipments will be indeed later, so we have more fast shipments. So we have revenue recognition delayed.
Now we said a quarter ago that the impact of those fast shipments, this revenue recognition delay, was going to be about EUR 1 billion for this year. Now where we are today, we think it's going to be EUR 2.8 billion. So we have about EUR 1.8 billion of more revenue recognition delays. And those delays, of course, translate into our 2022 sales number. So currently, we think sales will grow a bit about 10%, which if you do the math, would come around EUR 20.5 billion for 2022.
Now in summary, if you then look at what we said a quarter ago and where we are today, a quarter ago, we said sales going to grow with 20%, grow which brings you to EUR 22.3 billion, but with EUR 1 billion of deferred revenue recognition because of fast shipments.
Where we are now, we say, well, it's 10%, let's will bring you to EUR 20.5 billion with EUR 2.8 billion of deferred revenue because of fast shipments. So when you look at the business volume or the shipment value, it's effectively these quarters are basically the same. So our guidance from that point of view has not changed. What does it all mean for the different business segments for the year? Well, when you look at EUV, we're shipping 55 systems. We said that before. However, because of those fast shipments and the revenue recognition delay, the deferred revenue, we are now looking at -- which, by the way, are 15 EUV systems. We are now looking at a revenue, a booked revenue for EUV for 40 systems, so which is about EUR 6.4 billion in sales. 
Now on deep UV, we see a significant number of deep UV shipments, a significant increase as compared to last year. But also there, we are seeing the impact of these fast shipments. So we think we'll end up around EUR 8.6 billion in sales for deep UV, which is just over 15% increase as compared to last year, which, by the way, previous quarter, we thought it was going to be 20%.
And on Installed Base Management, 10% growth as compared to last year, EUR 5.5 billion in total. So add up to EUR 6.4 million for EUV, 8.6% for deep UV, 5.5 for Installed Base management, 20.5 billion for 2022, which is about a 10% increase. So we see an increase in delayed revenue. There are concerns around inflation. How does this all impact your gross margin for the year? Yes. We started the year with a gross margin expectation of about 53%, and we corrected that in Q1 to -- with 1 percentage point to about 52%, largely because of the unexpected increased inflationary effects. Where we are today, we see the following. Of course, most importantly, we are deferring EUR 1.8 billion more of revenue to 2023. It happens to be our higher-margin immersion and EUV systems.
Now next to that, we're starting our systems late because of the late delivery of parts, which means that we have fewer systems this year that can cover the fixed cost. So it's fixed cost coverage. And you have to remember the fixed costs are also going up because we are planning, and we will ship more systems next year as we see it today. So we need to invest.
And last but not least, we see inflationary effects. I mean, we've seen an acceleration of inflationary pressure on labor, on freight, specifically on parts. And all in all, if you then look at it, we expect that, the gross margin for 2022 will end up between 49% and 50%.
Now having said that, of course, we're in discussion today with our ecosystem partners, our suppliers and our customers to see how we can basically fairly share the burden of all these cost increases. And now looking at it, I think it's really when you look at 2022 and look at the lower guidance on gross margin, it's driven by these short-term effects. It's inflationary effects that we didn't plan for. It's the supply chain challenges that led to deferred revenue, is all shorter term.
And of course, we're in discussion with our customers to see how we can fairly share this. But I think longer term, there is no reason whatsoever we see currently to change our ambition for our gross margin targets around 2025, which is between 54% and 56%. Let's have a look at the market. What's your current view on the market, both in the near term and the longer term? Yes. A good question. I think near term, clearly, we see a very mixed messages coming out of the customer base. With respect to consumer-related products, we clearly see a slowdown, particularly in PCs and in smartphones. On the other hand, in the industrial space, when you talk about high-performance compute, you talk about automotive, the demand is still very, very strong.
And I think it's also evidenced by the utilization rates of our machines that are in the Installed Base, which are at a historical high. and it's still the case today. But we were also seeing across different semiconductor nodes inventories going up towards, let's say, pre-COVID-type levels. And that's pretty broad based. So all in all, yes, it's a bit of a mixed picture shorter term.
Longer term, I think there is no denying that the digital transition that's taking place will continue. We see it very clearly in automotive. Talking to customers and customers' customers, we see a quadrupling or quintupling of the semiconductor content.
Lately, our customers are talking about the energy transition. The renewable energy transition, which is very topical these days, will require semiconductors for wind and for solar and for the smart grid. On top of that, we see the Internet of Everything, everything that we've seeing in terms of sensors and actuators needing semiconductors, it's happening, will not go away.
On top of that, more energy-efficient, high-performance compute, need more transistors. So the die are getting larger. We're needing more extra wafers. The geopolitical situation, the technological sovereignty that countries are after is driving these big investment and subsidy programs. And we also think that if we look at the announcements, the competition in the foundry space will also go up. So all in all, longer term, very healthy and abated views, a good and very healthy growth. Shorter-term mixed signals. What does this all mean for the demand for your products this year and next year? Well, let me, first of all, say that when we look at 2022 and 2023, you look at the order intake, EUR 8.5 billion of order intake, which is a quarterly historical high, very engaged order discussions with our customers this quarter. We see a backlog of over EUR 33 billion. So I think that looks very healthy.
Now having said that, I think for 2022, we are, of course, not blind for anything that we hear with respect to inflationary pressures, probably recessionary concerns. So for 2022, I don't think it will have any real effect in terms of our shipments.
For 2023, you really have to ask the question, what kind of recession are you looking at? If it's a moderate recession, I think the impact will be very limited for a simple reason that we have such a big backlog that our customers are coming to us and saying, listen, if we see a slowdown, sure, well, one thing is certain, we want your machines. And it's logical. Those machines are very critical, long lead time.
And you have to remember that, of our backlog, 85% is for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, high-end immersion and EUV. And of the remaining 15%, mature technology also needed for advanced production. So I think all in all, pretty healthy.
And for 2023, if we see the supply chain constraints going away by the end of the year, which we're planning for or even if it's the first part of 2023, we will definitely need our capacity that we are planning, which is over 60 EUV systems and over 375 deep UV systems; with this potential risk of a moderate recession, we will need that capacity because our customers tell us. So it's going to be a good and healthy year. Yes. So anyhow, strong demand. Do you expect that strong demand to continue beyond 2023? Yes, absolutely. I think I talked about the big secular trends. These are the longer-term trends, and semiconductors are everywhere. And it's also obvious that big societal challenges need big solutions, and semiconductors go to the heart of those.
So as is yes, semiconductors will grow, semiconductor industry will grow, litho intensity will increase. And as a matter of fact, if we look at that, we just -- are going to just repeat what we said a quarter ago that we do need structurally more capacity.
And as we said, by 2025, we want to have a build capacity for EUV of 90 systems and deep UV of 600 systems. And beyond 2025, we want to build at least 20 High-NA systems. I think that is still very much intact, and we're working with our suppliers to get it done. Now clearly, we will go into some more detail on those capacity numbers and on the drivers for those capacity numbers during our Capital Markets Day, which is on November 11 of this year. Can you give us an update on your plans for the use of cash? Yes. I think the future is very bright. So our cash generation will be quite significant. But first of all, like we've always done, we will use the cash first to run our business. And secondly, then we will pay a dividend, which is going to be an increasing dividend.
And by the way, we've decided to move from a semiannual dividend to a quarterly dividend, where we're starting in Q3 an interim dividend for the first time this quarter. And any excess cash we will use for share buybacks, as we have done in the past. So no change to our policy. How would you all summarize this? Well, if you look at the big picture, you have to really make a distinction between the short term issues and the long-term issues. Short term, there's no denial that there are concerns. There are inflationary concerns, recessionary concerns. As at the [indiscernible] it is now, we have supply chain constraints that leads to fast shipments and deferral of revenue recognition, we'll deal with that.
But also short term, we look at an order backlog, which is very strong. We look at a customer demand for 2022 and 2023, that is unabated, which can withstand any moderate recession in our opinion. And then, of course, we have the longer-term trends.
I think the longer-term trends are, like I said earlier, unabated. I mean, it's obvious that the digital transformation will continue and will provide a very, very healthy growth profile for the company going forward with us and with our customers.
And of course, we'll go into more detail. We will go into more detail in November, November 11, I said it before, where we will definitely share with our stakeholders and with our investors our views as to the drivers and to the capacity needs for this industry and for ASML specifically. So we're looking forward to that.","second quarter ended EUR 5.4 billion in sales and about EUR 1.3 billion in Installed Base . gross margin came in at 49.1%, which is a bit of a lower end of the guidance . mainly because of supply chain challenges, supply chain constraints, parts not coming in on time, but we managed the quarter .",1.0
2022-10-19,19,10,2022,391.6550598144531,-0.19747096560533484,0.0,0.9996,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2022,"Mr. Dassen, can you give us a summary of the third quarter results? Absolutely. Net sales came in at EUR 5.8 billion, which was above guidance included in that EUR 5.8 billion number, EUR 1.5 billion of installed base revenue.
Why was it higher than guided? A number of reasons. First off, the installation time in the field is -- actually, it's faster than we anticipated, and that means that we get revenue faster as a result of that. So that was one big reason.
Secondly, we already mentioned the installed base business. So that was more than we anticipated because of some field upgrades.
And thirdly, we put -- also in the past quarters, we put options at factory -- a specific factory option on the machines. And that factory option led to delayed revenue because, first, the factory option needed to demonstrate its value to the customers. A number of key customers have now accepted that value, and as a result of that, the deferred revenue that we booked in previous quarters has now been released. So it's in that combination really that the revenue was higher than we guided.
Also from a gross margin perspective, higher than we anticipated, 51.8%, primarily driven by, I would say, the last 2 things that I've just mentioned. So the deferred revenue release of the factory option and also the fact that we were into -- able to pull in some installed base business. Also, the factory option was a pull-in, right, because that meant that the value was actually demonstrated earlier than we originally anticipated.
So those are the main reasons why both the revenue and gross margin are higher than guided last quarter.
The net income for the quarter came in at EUR 1.7 billion. And also very noteworthy, I think, is the net BOs -- net bookings came in at a record EUR 8.9 billion for this quarter. Included in there, EUR 3.8 billion for EUV, including a number of High-NA orders.
So all in all, I would say, a strong quarter both in terms of revenue, in terms of gross margin and also in terms of order intake. What's your guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year? For the fourth quarter, our guidance for sales is between EUR 6.1 billion and EUR 6.6 billion. Included in there, we expect EUR 1.6 billion for installed base revenue. In terms of gross margin, we expect approximately 49%. If you then translate that into the full year 2022, we would get around -- at the midpoint, we would get around EUR 21.1 billion revenue for the full year at a gross margin approaching 50%. Can you give us an update on the current supply chain situation and your confidence in resolving these issues? Yes, I think it's good in that context, just to look at the facts. And I think one factor is just to look at if you adjust the quarter revenue for the fast ship effect, I think that gives you -- if you normalize that, then I think you get a good proxy for what the -- how the output capacity for ASML and its supply chain really has developed itself. And if you take that perspective, so you normalize the revenue for the fast ship effect, and you would see that for Q1, we were at EUR 4.9 billion in normalized revenue. In Q2, we were at EUR 5.7 billion. In Q3, the quarter we just completed, at EUR 6 billion. And at the midpoint that we're now guiding for Q4, we would be around EUR 6.4 billion. So there you see a gradual uptick of the normalized revenue, again, as a good proxy of the output capability that ASML and its supply chain demonstrate.
And I think that's a good indication and a good evidence, I think, of the fact that we are getting a better handle on the supply chain situation. And the better handle means that we actually see the move rates in the supply chain go up and we also see the predictability of those move rates going up. So we put a lot of effort into this, working very closely with the supply chain and particularly with those suppliers that were struggling a little bit. But I think all in all, I think the situation is definitely progressing. I think the capacity that we now see, both for ourselves and also the supply chain, I think, position us very nicely for what we've communicated before as the output target and the shipment targets that we would have for next year, which is more than 60 EUV tools and more than 375 DUV. There's a lot of uncertainty around the supply of natural gas. Do you see any impact of that on your business? So we definitely looked into that. We looked into that for our own operations. We're a very mild consumer of natural gas. So for us, we've established that the risk profile is very low. We also looked at our Tier 1 suppliers -- our key Tier 1 suppliers. And also there, we have determined that either it's -- the risk is low or they are very well prepared to deal with the situation and have developed alternatives. We looked beyond that point, and we really looked into a number of subsuppliers and if there are subsuppliers that are confronted with a high-risk situation around this. In those instances, we're working very hard with them to look at -- to work on the alternatives and just make sure that everyone is very well prepared. So clearly something we're looking into, but I think we're making really good progress on making sure that the entire supply chain is well prepared for that -- for any eventualities in that regard. Are you seeing any change in demand from your customers with slowing consumer demand potential recession ahead? What does it mean for demand for your products in 2023? Yes, it's a very valid point. I mean it's very clear that the world is changing very rapidly, and this combination of inflation on the one hand and also consumer confidence taking ahead, it's -- these are serious developments and create a lot of uncertainty and uncertainty that is really at a very different level -- I would say, at the macro uncertainty, I think, is at a very different level than it was even a couple of months or quarters ago. So that's clearly the case.
And of course, in such a climate of uncertainty of consumers, inflation risks, recession risks clearly there, I think that obviously also has an impact on our customers. And you see some customers actually running our tools at a utilization level which is below the record levels that we've seen before. We also see a number of our customers reducing the CapEx that they are forecasting. And we also see now for the first time since quite a while that actually some customers are actually delaying the preferred time that they would like to get our tools. So we see those dynamics.
But I have to say the lion's share of our customers really keeps on pushing us in terms of getting the tools and getting them sooner rather than later. So there's a few customers that are indicating a preference for some delay, but the lion's share of the customers are really pushing, and they're raising their hand to say if there is a delay someplace else, then please get the tools to us even earlier.
And I think that's also evidenced by the strength of the order book. Again, we just mentioned record order intake of EUR 8.9 billion. That gets to an order book at the end of Q3 of over EUR 38 billion, which is a number that we've never seen before at ASML. And in there, 85% of that order book really is for EUV and for immersion, so really caters to the more advanced and strategic part of semiconductor manufacturing.
And I think that's really also what's going on. I think, clearly, the secular trends, as we always call them, are very much intact. I mean customers really want to make those technology transitions. They really are building capacity also beyond 2023. And also, there is still this element of tech sovereignty that we've been talking about, right, the fact that governments want to be more self-sufficient in their semiconductor manufacturing. So those secular trends are still very much intact. And I think that creates a situation that we're seeing, where the lion's share of the customers are really still pushing us to get the tools sooner rather than later.
So your question on '23, obviously, it's a bit early to be too granular and too specific. But we mentioned before the over 60 EUV tools, the more than 375 DUV tools. And I would say if indeed we're able to sustain the good momentum that we just talked about in the supply chain and provided we're not going to be confronted with some very unexpected developments on the demand side, I think that's still a good indication for what we're looking at in terms of shipment. So clearly, uncertainty at a very different level than what we've seen before. But I think we still have some very strong dynamics going in favor of us. And how do you prepare for these uncertainties? Well, the key word there, I think, is flexibility, right? And that's also something that we're working on as ASML, so to make sure that both on the supply chain as it relates to our own manufacturing capability and also in our workforce that we have sufficient flexibility available, both flexibility that in terms of an unanticipated sudden decline in demand that we're able to collectively respond to that in the right fashion but also making sure that we're also -- when things start to pick up again, that we're able to respond to that in a very flexible way as well.
So that's what we're doing. I think it's part and parcel of the capacity expansion that we're doing to do that and to execute that in a flexible way. Anything in that way, we do whatever it takes to be well prepared for any eventualities in that regard. Have you seen any further increases in inflationary effects? And how do you recover from the inflationary costs with regard to your gross margin next year? So I mean we talked about it last time. Obviously, the inflationary effects are there, both on labor cost, on freight, on parts. So that's clearly going on. We also mentioned we're having good discussions with our customers on that front to kind of share the burden within the ecosystem. And I think generally, there is a good depreciation of customers that they understand what we're being confronted with. And there's also a good appreciation that there needs to be a mechanism to indeed share that burden. So I would expect to get a benefit from that in the course of -- in 2023 and to start seeing that compensation.
In terms of the impact that it will have on 2023, so we should get some positive impact on the gross margin from that element. Also for '23, I would expect to recover, if you like, from the gross margin impact from the fast shipments. Of course, the gross margin of this year was impacted by the fact that we had these fast shipments. That impact should be significantly less in 2023 from a gross margin perspective. So those, I would say, would be benefits.
I mean the flip side of that is, clearly, inflation might continue. So there is still quite some uncertainty around the level of inflation. So it's also very hard to predict what exactly the inflation rate for next year is going to be. And also, we should bear in mind, we continue to ramp. We continue to build capacity. And obviously, that means that you're having costs ahead of really utilizing that capacity, and that will continue to have a burden on the gross margin for next year.
So if you add it all up, I think all in all, as I mentioned, we have the gross margin approaching 50% in this year. That's what we expect. You also know that we indicated -- for 2025, we articulated an expectation of a gross margin between 54% and 56%. And I think we should also, next year, see the gradual development from the gross margin of this year towards that objective of 54% to 56% that we articulated before. We should see that gradual progress actually happening. As said, there is strong demand for your products. Do you think that this strong demand will continue beyond 2023? And can you elaborate on your expansion plans? Yes. So as I just mentioned, I think the secular trends are there, right? So clearly, there is uncertainty in the short term, but the secular trends are there for all the good reasons that we just mentioned.
So from that vantage point, clearly, we believe expanding our capacity is the right thing to do. And we are in very close collaboration with our supply chain to get that done. We recently had a Supplier Day here at ASML to really talk with the suppliers about these expansion plans, about the progress that they're making, also making sure that people learn from one another. So there's a lot of positive dynamic around that theme and a lot of alignment within the supply chain to really get to those levels that we mentioned before, which is 90 EUV systems, 600 DUV systems around the '25 time frame and then, medium term, 20 High-NA systems. What's the impact of the latest export control restrictions announced by the U.S. government? Does this impact your business in China? So I would say the direct impact on ASML is fairly limited. I should say, of course, we're still in the process of evaluating it. It's a very extensive document, as you know. So we're still in the process of really digesting it and looking at it. But our initial appreciation is that the direct implication for us is fairly limited.
So why is that? Well, first off, as you know, we are a -- we're a European company, right? So there is not a lot of U.S. technology in our tools. So that's the first reason. Of course, we will always adhere to the rule of law, right? So also the U.S. export laws as they pertain to us, of course, we will do whatever it takes to follow those. There's no doubt about it. But the fact that we are a European company with limited U.S. technology in it, of course, it creates this situation where the direct impact on us is fairly limited. We can continue to ship non-EUV lithography tools out of Europe into China.
So the direct impact on us, I would say, is fairly limited. Of course, there could be indirect effects. And those indirect effects could be that the Chinese manufacturers, to the extent that they do not get other equipment that they need in their fabs, for instance, from the United States, of course, there could be an indirect effect on the demand for our tools. But there, I would say it's important to recognize that we're clearly still in a situation where the supply is below what the demand is. So to the extent that at a certain point in time, we would be in a position that we can no longer supply certain tools to certain customers in China. The demand outside of China is still such that we would get compensation for that in the current environment from other customers. To conclude, can you give us an update on your plans for the use of cash? Yes. So I would say, in principle, nothing changes, right? So as you all know, the primary utilization of cash is, within the business, to make sure that from an R&D perspective, CapEx perspective, the cash that is needed to pursue our road map is there. So that's still the primary purpose.
Then we've also said we're looking at a dividend that we want to grow over time. And the proposal for next quarter, so for Q4, we will have an interim dividend of EUR 1.37.
And you also know that what is available above that, so what is available in terms of cash over and above what we need for the business to pursue our road map and what is needed for this growing dividend will be returned to shareholders by means of a share buyback -- by share buybacks. The share buyback program -- the existing share buyback program, we just completed. So quite well ahead of time.
We will have -- as you know, we will have our Capital Markets Day on November 11. There, of course, we're going to talk about how we see the 2025 and the 2030 scenarios developing. So how do we see demand developing, the supply situation? So what's our expectation also financially for those years 2025 and 2030. We're also -- in that Capital Markets Day, we'll talk about our plans for a new share buyback program. So there, we will have a concrete program available and ready to discuss and present to the shareholders.
So I'm very much looking forward to that. It's going to be an interesting day, November 11, where -- amidst the uncertainty that we also talked about, to talk about the medium and the longer term and the really good prospects that we continue to see for ASML and its business. So very much looking forward to seeing all of you there, either in person or in video. We'll see you there.","net sales came in at EUR 5.8 billion, EUR 1.5 billion of installed base revenue . a number of reasons: the installation time in the field is faster than we anticipated . the factory option was a pull-in, because that meant the value was actually demonstrated earlier than we originally anticipated, he says .",1.0
2023-01-31,31,1,2023,640.277099609375,0.6347984880182749,0.0,0.998,Earnings Call Transcript Q4-2022,"Mr. Wennink, can you give us a summary of the fourth quarter and full year results 2022? Yes, let's start with the fourth quarter. Let's start with net sales. Net sales were -- came in about EUR 6.4 billion, which is at the midrange of our guidance. However, we were able to accelerate, what we call, fast shipments on deep UV also in Q4, which actually was quite a significant number because if you would add the fast shipments to the EUR 6.4 billion, then the normalized sales for Q4 would have been EUR 7.4 billion.
Now for the total year, EUR 21.2 billion in sales, of which about EUR 3.1 billion of fast shipments went into 2023. So the net effect of the fast shipments plus the revenue of EUR 21.2 billion would give you a normalized revenue, if you would have booked the fast shipments as revenue, of EUR 24 billion, which is quite a significant increase as compared to last year. So that's on the system -- that's on the total sales.
On Installed Base, about EUR 1.7 billion of Installed Base sales, which is higher than our guidance. That has to do with the fact that we had a pull-in of, what we call, field upgrades. And field upgrades from Q1 into Q4, which gave us an extra boost in sales in Installed Base.
Now on the gross margin. The gross margin -- a good gross margin number, 51.5% in Q4. That is also the result of the pull-in of these field upgrades because they're high margin. And we had a one-off, which basically we got an insurance settlement on the Berlin fire which happened last year. So that was a one-off. So for the total year, 50.5% gross margin, pretty good.
Net income, because that's a result of the gross margin and all the cost, EUR 1.8 billion in Q4 and EUR 5.6 billion for the year. On bookings, bookings were good in Q4. We booked over EUR 6 billion in terms of bookings, leading to a record backlog by the end of 2022 of over EUR 40 billion. We've never seen that before. So a record backlog.
So if you peel it off and you look at the year and you look at the quarter that actually was quite a good year, good performance under some challenging circumstances. Can you provide your initial outlook for this year 2023? Yes, like I said, some challenging circumstances that we're currently facing. I mean, clearly, there's a fear of a recession, that's driven by high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical confrontations, discussions about export controls. On top of that, we see a weaker demand for consumer-related products such as smartphones and PCs. We see some lower growth rates in the data center domain, but strong demand and still in the industrial space, for instance, automotive.
So all in all, if you look at the situation today, it's not a surprise that our customers are currently seeing inventories rise because we see a lower demand in some of these areas. So inventory for chips are going up. And also then the natural reaction, what customers are doing to actually swiftly turn that is to reduce the utilization of the machines in the installed base. This is what we're seeing. We're seeing that the utilization rates of our tools is going down. Our customers are swiftly adapting their output to reduce inventory.
And by doing that, they hope and they expect that the industry will then recover in the second half of the year. Now that's being helped, potentially helped also by the recovery of the Chinese economy coming out of the COVID crisis. This is an expectation that the industrial activity and thereby semiconductors will actually go up again in the second half of the year. So all in all, customers are expecting a better second half of 2023.
What does it mean to us? Basically, the situation for us is that the demand that we're currently seeing because of this is still much higher than what we can make. So why are we not affected then? Well, that's a very simple conclusion that the expectation of the duration of a potential recession in the minds of our customers is much shorter than the average lead time of our machines because they want to prepare, because of the strategic nature of our machines, for an upturn in the second half of the year and 2024. That means that the demand is still higher than what we can make. And that means that our plan is still to produce 60 EUV systems this year and 375 deep UV systems, about 25% immersion of that 375, which actually means that we will see a significant step up in the 2023 sales numbers.
And if you split it out in -- over the different business sectors, then you'll see that EUV business will probably grow about 40%, the non-EUV business about 30%. Installed Base business will see some lower growth rates, it's logical. The utilization rates in the factories in the first half of this year will be down. So not a lot of field upgrades. It's about 5%. Now if we add all up, we think that 2023 could give us an increase in sales of more than 25% over 2022, which is a significant step-up from where we are today, which is under the circumstances, a pretty good foresight. What's your guidance for this quarter, Q1? Well, on Q1 -- basically, Q1 is also a reflection of a very strong Q4. And what I mean with this is that we expect sales between EUR 6.1 billion to EUR 6.5 billion, about EUR 1.5 billion of Installed Base sales. But like I said earlier, there has been, you could say, an acceleration of deep UV shipments from -- in Q4 that come from Q1. The same is true for field upgrades, so from Q1 2023 into Q4. So that is why we see the sales number not significantly higher than the fourth quarter. However, because we do see more than 25% increase for the total year, you could expect a growing quarterly sales numbers throughout this year.
From a margin point of view in Q1, between 49% to 50%, that's basically the reflection of lower Installed Base business, basically because of the upgrades, which is high-margin business. What are your expectations for your gross margin for the full year '23? Yes. I mean, we saw 50.5% for the total year 2022. Now there's a couple of building blocks for the gross margin in 2023. The first one is the volume, the higher volume. We have higher volume from '23 as compared to '22, which means that in EUV and in deep UV, we'll have a positive impact on the gross margin because of higher volume.
On Installed Base, we see lower growth rates, as we explained. And we see then, I think, a lower level of field upgrades, which is high-margin business. So that could have a slightly negative effect on the gross margin for this year.
Inflation, that's on people's mind. Now we do believe this year, we -- there will be kind of a net-zero effect because, yes, we'll have higher inflation costs, but also we have inflation compensation from customers.
And then the last point, we do will see higher cost levels. It has to do with the build-out of the capacity that we need, not only for '23, but for '24 and '25. And that is the capacity build-out in EUV, in deep UV and in High-NA. That will lead to higher cost levels.
So the year will start Q1 with gross margin between 49% and 50%, but that will gradually increase throughout the year. I'd like to add to that, that is, in fact, on the trajectory towards our gross margin that we gave as a guidance for '25 at our Capital Markets Day, which we believe by that time, 2025, will be between 54% and 56% and between 56% and 60% by 2030. So we're well on track. You just touched on it. The discussion around export controls and the situation -- the geopolitical situation between China and the U.S. Can you give us an update? Yes. I think you said it's geopolitical. So we're business people. We're not politicians. So -- but I'd like to refer, I think there were some good comments made by our Dutch Prime Minister last week when he visited Washington and spoke to the U.S. President. Actually, a summary of his comments were, this is a multinational question that needs to be answered. It's an issue between several countries, not only the Dutch and the Americas, but several countries.
And also, multiple companies are involved with a complex supply chain, upstream and downstream. It's a complex industry. In fact, what he said, ""It's a complex issue. It's a sensitive issue. There's a lot at stake. There's high economic stakes. So we have to find a balanced solution."" And that's I think where the politicians are. But I think it's a fair reflection of where we are. And I think there were some good comments made.
Now of course, there have been media articles coming out that basically speculating and suggestions on what the potential outcome could be. But we just have to look at the facts. The facts are that nothing really changed since the October regulations that came out of the United States, which actually means that we can -- we will not ship EUV to China, for instance, but we can still ship deep UV and metrology and inspection tools.
And any further speculation of what might the outcome be, I think, doesn't help. I mean we just have to wait for the governments and the politicians to keep talking and come to a reasonable solution. That's where we are today. Can you update us on your capital allocation plans? Yes. Our capital allocation plans are actually quite consistent. We will generate a lot of cash because the company will grow quite substantially. And of course, we will first use our cash to build the business. And when we've done that, we'll use the cash to pay a growing dividend and any -- out of cash left, we will buy back shares.
Now on the dividend, we'll propose to the general meeting of shareholders, a closing dividend of EUR 1.69, which will bring the 2022 dividend to EUR 5.80. And for Q1, we're going to pay an interim dividend of EUR 1.37. Now that's for the dividend.
On share buybacks, we've announced at the Capital Markets Day, our EUR 12 billion program for the next 3 years. And like I said, any excess cash when we use it for our business and pay the dividend, we'll use for the share buybacks. What are your expectations regarding demand and your business beyond 2023? Well, I think the medium- to longer-term future of the company is very bright. I mean, it has to -- it is driven by the fact that semiconductor applications are growing at a significantly accelerated speed. Think about the big societal problems, whether it's electrification, the digital revolution, it's the energy transition, everything you touch is semiconductors.
And I think it's clear also the way that we look at the world, but also world analyst firms have looked into that this industry of our customers, the semiconductor industry, will grow to $1 trillion or $1 trillion-plus by 2030. It actually means that we need to be able to provide our customers with systems and with services that will help them to make that output.
And that's also why, as we said at the Capital Markets Day, we will and we are continuously with our supply chain, investing for a capacity of 90 EUV systems and 600 deep UV systems by the 2025-2026 time frame and 20 High-NA systems, next-generation EUV by 2027-2028. So if we take it all together, that -- and then depending on whether we're in a high market or low market by 2025, we could be anywhere between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion in sales. And also depending on whether we will be in a lower or a higher market by 2030, we think we'll be between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion sales by that time.
So no matter how you look at it, semiconductors are positioned extremely well when it comes to growth, and helping some of the large and big solutions for the big problems that we all face. And I think so we are looking forward to a very bright future. And perhaps, yes, of course, there will be short-term issues that we have to deal with, but mid- to long-term, very bright future and very strong growth.","net sales came in about EUR 6.4 billion, which is at the midrange of our guidance . but we were able to accelerate fast shipments on deep UV also in Q4 . we had a pull-in of field upgrades from Q1 into Q4, which gave us an extra boost in sales .",1.0
2023-04-19,19,4,2023,634.7965087890625,-0.008559717071961681,0.0,0.9972,Earnings Call Transcript Q1-2023,"Mr. Dassen, can you give us a summary of the first quarter results 2023? Sure. Net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 6.7 billion, higher than guided primarily as a result of higher EUV and deep UV revenue, both driven by faster insulation in the field of our systems and also driven by, in a number of cases, earlier acceptance of the tool by our customers. Included in the EUR 6.7 billion is EUR 1.4 billion of installed base revenue. That is lower than we guided and that is primarily as a result of lower upgrade demand from our customers.
Fast shipment, obviously, a topic that we have been talking about quite a bit in previous quarters. As you might recall, we had EUR 3 billion of delayed revenue from shipments coming out of Q4 into Q1. At the end of Q1, we have about EUR 1.5 billion of delayed revenue that is going to be recognized in subsequent quarters. Why lower? Why EUR 1.5 billion versus the EUR 3 billion? A couple of reasons. One reason is actually what I discussed earlier on, which is the earlier acceptance of the customer and the faster installation.
But also, as you might recall, we said that in Q4, we really prioritized shipment over system starts. And why was that?  A, because customers were asking for it. They wanted to have the tools earlier. And secondly, also for operational efficiency reasons. Gross margin for the quarter of 50.6%, again higher as a result of the things I just mentioned. So higher because of higher EUV revenue and higher immersion revenue. A little bit compensated by the fact that we had lower upgrade business. So that gets you to the 50.6%.
Net income for the quarter, EUR 2 billion and the order intake for the quarter at EUR 3.8 billion. That is lower than what you would have seen in previous quarters. But quite frankly, that was expected, a, given the current business environment and also given the fact that we're still looking at an order book at the end of this quarter of EUR 39 billion which is give and take 2x the system sales that we expect for this year. What's your guidance for Q2? The guidance for Q2 net sales, we expect to be between EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 7 billion. Installed base revenue as part of that, approximately EUR 1.3 billion and we expect the gross margin for the quarter between 50% and 51%. Have there been any changes in the business environment? We continue to see the macro trends that we talked about last time. So higher interest rates, inflation, fear of recession in some parts of the world and the geopolitical attention. So they continue to be there. If you then translate that to the semiconductor space, we do see in certain segments and certain end market segments and we do see that the industry is trying to manage the inventory levels down.
So how does that translate into litho demand is then the question? Well, I think what we noticed is that some major customers are indeed delaying the timing of their demand for certain tools. So that happens whilst we see other customers actually picking up that shift. So in that sense, for us, we still end up in a situation that supply is still the main constraint that we have. So demand is still higher than supply, albeit at a slightly lower cushion level, if you like, than we had last quarter, but it's clearly still there. So the #1 objective for us is still to make sure that we optimize the supply and that indeed we can deliver and that we can live up to the expectations that are out there.
If you then look specifically at a different segment. For both memory and logic customers, we do see customers making the strategic investments for technology transition. So that is clearly happening. For memory customers, we do see them limiting their CapEx, lowering their wafer output, which clearly is driving towards lowering the inventory level in the entire system. We see some of that behavior also in certain segments of logic. But quite frankly, we're also in logic, see that in certain segments, demand remains very, very strong, particularly, I would say, in the space of mature nodes and then particularly where that requires deep UV.
Specifically as it relates to China, as you would have seen, China accounted for about 8% of system sales in Q1. We also told you last time that China accounts -- domestic China accounts for more than 20% in our backlog, and that continues to be the case at the end of the -- for the backlog at the end of Q1. So I think it's reasonable to assume that we will see a commensurate allocation to Chinese customers for the entire year. So that means that you will see a significant pickup of the sales into domestic China for the quarters to come this year. How do all these developments translate into your outlook? I would say the outlook for 2023 essentially remains unchanged. So as we said before, we expect that we are going to ship around 60 EUV systems, around 375 deep UV systems, of which about 25% immersion. And that continues to be our expectation. And that translates into the growth numbers that we gave you last time, which is 40% growth in EUV, 30% growth in the non-EUV business and around a 5% increase in the installed base business. And that all translates into a growth expectation for the year in comparison to 2022 of more than 25%.
Underlying assumption there is that the fast shipment value that we received from 2022 and 2023 will be similar to what we see in getting out of the year -- out of '23 into '24, so about a EUR 3 billion number. That would be the underlying assumption for that expectation. With the recent communication from the Dutch government on export controls, can you provide an update on the expected impact to your deep UV business? We're still waiting for the final detailed guidance from the Dutch authorities. But as we said before, this is really geared towards advanced semiconductor manufacturing. That's what it's looking at. What this does for us is that we expect that we will require export control licenses or export licenses for advanced immersion tools. And our interpretation of advanced immersion tools would be for the NXT 2000 and subsequent versions.
What do we expect this will do well. If you look at some of the circumstances, so if we look at what the Dutch government published so far, our interpretation of the export license rules. If you look at the current climate but also if you look at the way we model our expectations on a go-forward basis, right? And that is really based on worldwide demand for litho. It's not based on geographic distribution. Then based on that, we would say that we believe the impact on our guidance for 2023 or on the scenarios that we model both for '25 and 2030, we do not expect that impact to be material on those expectations. Let's have a look at gross margin. Are there any changes to your expectations for gross margin this year? And that is what we said last quarter is the guidance that we would still provide, which is that we expect gross margin to end up slightly higher than what we had in 2022. Again, just as a reminder, the puts and takes to that. So on EUV, we expect a higher number of shipments. We mentioned the 60 -- about 60 shipments before. And we expect that to have a positive impact on gross margin.
On deep UV, same story there. We expect a higher number of deep UV revenue in this year, and that would be a positive. A slight negative would be the mix within deep UV. But nonetheless, for deep UV, we expect the gross margin on balance to be slightly up from last year.
Installed base business, there, we expect the gross margin to be going down a little bit, and that's because of, as we discussed earlier on that we expect the upgrade business to be a little less than last year.
We also talked quite a bit about inflation.  We are getting from quite a few customers, we are getting inflation compensation. So that's a good thing, but inflation continues to be there. So I still expect a small drag, if you like, on the gross margin number as a result of inflation. And then very importantly, as you know, we continue to build towards increasing capacity. So we have the 90 EUV capacity looking for by the 2025 time frame and the 600 deep UV capacity that we're aiming for, so we continue to prepare for that.
We also, as you know, are preparing for the introduction of High-NA. And all the preparatory work that is going on there, that continues to be a drag on the gross margin. So if you take all of those elements together, that leads to our expectation of a slight improvement of the gross margin in comparison to last year. And once again, I think that positions us very nicely for expectations that we guided earlier on in terms of gross margin by 2025, between 54% and 56% and between 56% and 60% by 2030. Can you update us on your capital allocation plans? I mean we continue to expect significant generation of cash in the years to come and the policy hasn't changed. And the policy, just as a reminder, whatever cash is being generated, first off, we will apply that to the business needs, so whatever CapEx or whatever we would need that will be funded from the free cash flow that is being generated by the business. Whatever remains will be available to the shareholders, and that will be available through a combination of growing dividends and then whatever is available, would be allocated to share buyback.
If you look at the current environment and the current environment in the semiconductor industry that we talked about earlier on, you do see that all the elements, all the players in the value chain, they're really managing their cash quite diligently. So I think it's fair to assume that, that will have some negative impact on our free cash flow generation in the year. And also, in the current environment, we believe it is prudent that we maintain a higher level of cash than you would typically see us do. So that's a combination, I think, that we're looking at.
As it relates to dividends, we paid an interim dividend in this -- in Q1 of EUR 1.37 per ordinary share. And that was -- as it relates to 2020 -- to the year 2022, that was the third interim dividend that we paid for the same amount, so 3x EUR 1.37. And that means that we're going to propose to the AGM to pay a final dividend of EUR 1.69 per ordinary share. What are your expectations on demand and your business beyond 2023? At the Investor Day last year, we very much talked about the megatrends. So what are the megatrends that are going on. And I think the implications that we were derived from that were a broadening application space of semiconductors. And those secular trends that we discussed there, they continue to fuel the demand for our systems. They continue to fuel demand for service. So we think all of that is very clearly intact.
That also means that we continue to drive the capacity expansions that we've talked about before, 90 EUV, 600 deep UV systems. So we continue to be on that track working very, very closely with our supply chain to get that done. And we believe that with that capacity expansion and with the very strong secular growth drivers, that we will be able to capture the opportunities and the growth opportunities that the market and the macro environment is going to present this on a go-forward basis.","net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 6.7 billion, higher than guided primarily as a result of higher EUV and deep UV revenue . included in the EUR 1.4 billion of installed base revenue is lower than guided and that is primarily due to lower upgrade demand from our customers .",0.0
2023-07-19,19,7,2023,749.1515502929688,0.18014440835859324,0.0,0.9993,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2023,"Mr. Wennink, can you give us a summary of the second quarter results, 2023? Yes. The second quarter was a solid quarter. I mean sales came in at EUR 6.9 billion, which is at the high end of our guidance range. Installed base business, EUR 1.3 billion. We had a good gross margin, 51.3%. That is the result of the fact that we sold more immersion systems than we anticipated. And on top of that, we started to revenue recognize the immersion fast shipments in Q2, which actually gave us some extra sales, which have some extra margin. So that was the reason for a good gross margin number in Q2. Net income, EUR 1.9 billion, EUR 4.5 billion on order intake, solid quarter. What's your guidance for the third quarter? Third quarter, we expect sales to come in anywhere between EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 7 billion, about EUR 1.4 billion of installed base business, 50% of gross margin. And actually, our guidance for Q3 is pretty similar as the guidance we gave 3 months ago for Q2. Let's have a look at the market. Have there been any recent changes in market dynamics? Yes, I think you can say so. I think it's all driven by macroeconomics. -- macroeconomics, we still see relatively high inflation rates, high interest rates. So fear of recession in Europe and the U.S. geopolitical environment is also difficult from time to time. So yes, I think the macroeconomic situation has not improved. Now on the end markets, we see some first reports coming in that some end market seems to be bottoming out, which is good. But it means that our customers are still dealing with relatively high inventories, high levels. And how do you deal with that basically by reducing the wafer output. And wafer output means that, of course, the utilization of our tools is also less. What does that mean? I mean on our EUV business, we see some shift in demand timing. That is largely driven, I would say, predominantly driven by fab readiness.
The fabs are not ready. And why is that? There are skills issues. We've said it before, I mean whether it's in Taiwan or whether it's in the U.S., no skills issues, people who actually have the capability to build these very advanced fabs. There's a little -- there's also some element in thereof, of course, the macroeconomic situation where people have some concerns about the duration of this down cycle. I think that's what we're seeing for EUV. On deep UV, the demands are higher than what we can make. Now of course, deep UV also has been impacted by what I said on EUV because we've seen some pushbacks, some pushouts in terms of the demand across different segments in the industry. However, we also need to realize that our Chinese customers had over the last 2 years a so-called demand fill rate. So how much of your demand can we ship of [ signify ] less than 50%.
So our Chinese customers say, yes, we're happy to take the machines that others don't want because their fabs are ready, they can take the tools. So when they become available, they will take the tools. So all in all, our deep UV business still looks pretty strong. And that has to do with the fact that what I just said that there is a significant demand, which is still higher than what we can make. With the recent communication from the Dutch government on export controls, can you provide an update on the expected impact to your deep UV business? Yes. It's specifically on deep UV. A few weeks ago, the Dutch government came out with the final ruling, which was more or less in line with what we communicated about a quarter ago. And I think that in itself was not a major surprise that will become effective for September 1, and it deals with our, what we call advanced deep UV immersion systems, which is our tool type NXT 2000 and subsequent numbers, so 2000, 2050, 2,100 and up. That's what it's all about. It's not about EUV. So -- but it's -- because EUV is already under export control. Now so we just have to wait to really get a final answer on your question. We also need to understand what the American government has done. The Japanese government has come out with their ruling end of May, the Dutch government a few weeks ago.
So we're waiting for the American rules to come out. There have been some media reports that the Americans are contemplating some additional measures. Now because that's speculative. We don't know what it is. But what we understand will not have a major impact on what we said before. So I think all in all, when you look at export control measures in total, we don't expect a significant impact on our 2023 year, but also not on the longer-term outlook that we gave during the Capital Markets Day last year. With regard to fast shipments, have you made any progress with your customers on revenue recognition when it comes to fast shipments? Yes, we did. As a matter of fact, particularly on deep UV immersion. As you know, we do -- we fast ship deep UV immersion. and EUV. But on deep UV immersion we came to an agreement with customers where we basically have a reduced test protocol, which they now accept as good enough to basically recognize revenue when we ship the machine out of our factory in the Netherlands instead of taking revenue when we do the installation at the customer site. Now having said that, what does it mean? It means we're going to recognize more revenue in 2023. And we expect at about EUR 700 million worth of revenue now being booked in 2023, which we originally said was going to be pushed to 2024.
So our revenue that we now defer to -- out of 2023 into 2024 is not the EUR 3 billion that we said last quarter, but this EUR 3 billion, less EUR 700 million is EUR 2.3 billion. And that's only EUV. So it actually means that deferred revenue because of fast shipments not only applies to EUV. Of course, there, we will book revenue when we get the final sign-off at the customer side for EUV systems. What does all this mean for your business outlook for this year? This year, business outlook, like we said earlier, there is an impact on the macroeconomic situation. But if you then break that down into deep UV, EUV and installed base, they all have a bit of a different character. On deep UV, we expect to ship a bit more systems than the 375 units that we mentioned before, which is good. But on top of that, we also have the -- actually revenue recognition at shipment instead of at installation at the customer side for deep UV immersion systems, which all in all, gives us a higher sales number for deep UV immersion this year, where we originally anticipated that deep UV will grow with 30%, but now it will grow at 50%. So the deep UV business looks a lot more healthier than we actually said before.
On EUV, we see some -- like we said before, some shifts in demand in terms of timing largely driven by fab readiness fabs are not ready yet, so we will ship the tools later. That means that the original quoted growth number of 40% for EUV revenue this year will go down to about 25%. And on installed base, there's a reflection of the macroeconomic situation and the cautiousness or the conservative way that customers look at doing upgrades. You don't need to do an upgrade when you're reducing the utilization of your installed base. So we now expect instead of a 5% growth in installed base that to stay flat for this year. But if you take it all together, higher deep UV or lower EUV, flat installed base then the total sales of the companies are now expected to grow towards 30% instead of the earlier 25% that we said last quarter. What does this all mean for your gross margin in 2023? Well, if you take everything together, you take higher deep UV sales, lower EUV but installed base being flat. We have a positive impact on gross margin because of higher deep UV immersion sales but lower installed base sales with good margins. So it all in all washes out a bit, and that means that, as we said before, our gross margin this year will slightly increase. Let's have a look at the longer-term outlook. What are your expectations for 2024? Well, if we look at 2024, it will be driven by the macroeconomic development. We said it before, macroeconomics show higher interest rates, the higher inflation numbers, some fear of recession here and there. And that actually means that what we all thought that we would see this year, it would be a recovery in the second half of 2023. I think that's going to be later. That's not a general view that that's going to be later. Now having said that, ASML has a very solid and strong and healthy backlog of about EUR 38 billion. On top of that, when we look at the firm demand that we -- that our customers put on us together with the good backlog for next year, I think we see a very clear opportunity for growth in 2024. However, given all the increased uncertainties, I think it's too early to give you a prediction of any forecast for 2024. It's quite normal when we are in these down cycles.
We have to take it quarter by quarter. We will look at it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll just keep our eyes out on the inflection points for recovery. And how about your outlook beyond 2024? Well, beyond 2024, it's really the solid belief we have in the mega trends that are not going to go away. You could even argue that some of these mega trends when you think about AI or even more important than we thought, let's say, at the end of last year. But it's not only AI, it's also the energy transition, it's the electrification of mobility. It's -- it's industrial IoT. It's everything that's driven by sensors and an actuator.
So effectively, we see very strong growth across the entire semiconductor space, whether it's mature or whether it's advanced. And that because of these mega trends, we have still has a very strong confidence in what we said at the end of last year. But by 2025, depending on what market scenario you are choosing higher or lower, we will have between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion of sales and gross margin by 2025 timeframe between 54% and 56%. And if you extend that then to 2030, we are still very confident that by that time, also dependent on a lower or higher market scenario. The sales will be anywhere between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion with gross margin between 56% and 60%.
So we have short-term cycles. This is what the industry is all about -- but we have a very strong confidence, even more -- even strong confidence in what the longer-term future is going to bring for this company.","sales came in at EUR 6.9 billion, which is at the high end of our guidance range . we expect sales to come in anywhere between EUR 6.5 billion and EUR 7 billion, about EUR 1.4 billion of installed base business, 50% of gross margin . but macroeconomics, we still see relatively high inflation rates, high interest rates .",0.0
2023-10-18,18,10,2023,603.63818359375,-0.19423755666301856,0.0,0.9993,Earnings Call Transcript Q3-2023,"Mr. Dassen... ...can you give us a summary of the third quarter results 2023? Revenue came in at EUR 6.7 billion, which was around the midpoint of the guidance. Included in there, EUR 1.4 billion of installed base revenue. Gross margin came in at 51.9%. That was actually higher than we guided. Two reasons. One reason is the product mix, which was more on the immersion side. And then secondly, we had a number of one-off cost benefits in there.
Net income for the quarter, EUR 1.9 billion and then order intake, EUR 2.6 billion, lower than what we had in previous quarters. But quite frankly, that was as was expected. Because in the current environment, we do see customers being very cautious with cash, being very cautious with CapEx and as a result of that, they're also very cautious with putting in orders. No High-NA orders in our POs for this quarter. And we're still looking at an order book of over EUR 35 billion. So quite a few orders still in the books and that's also reason why customers can actually manage to have quite low POs for this quarter. Can you comment on your sales to China, which increased? Yes, China percentage in our sales was quite high this quarter. Again, I think this is something that we communicated about before. I think a couple of things are important there. As we mentioned before, the shipments into China are really for mid-critical and mature nodes. I think it's also fair to recognize that most of the shipments that happened in this quarter are based on POs that we already had in '22 and even the year before. So it's really based on bookings that we had in '22 and before. And as we mentioned before, the order fill rate that we had for China in the past couple of years has been rather low. As a matter of fact, below 50%.
What's happening right now, we see a number of other customers, we see some shifts in the timing of demand and that really allows for a higher fill rate, order fill rate of our Chinese customers and that's exactly what's happening right now. And so higher volume in China, lower volume of other customers. So that's why you see quite a high percentage there. And of course, all the shipments that were there very much within the limits of export regulation. What's your guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2023? Revenue for the fourth quarter, our expectation there is between EUR 6.7 billion and EUR 7.1 billion, included in there, EUR 1.4 billion of installed business, which would be similar to what we had in Q3 and our guidance for the gross margin between 50% and 51%. If you then look at the full year, then as to revenue, we're looking at growth towards 30% in comparison to 2022 and the gross margin would end up around 51%. So if you look at that, it's a pretty decent performance, I would say, in a year where the industry is going through difficult times, still growing towards the 30%, I think, is a pretty decent performance for the company. Can you give us an update regarding changes in the market dynamics since last quarter? Yes. I mean there's quite a bit going on. First, if you look at the macro front, I think it's plain to see for everyone. It's a combination of a few things. There's still pockets of inflation. We still see interest rates at pretty elevated levels. We still see GDP growth in some economies that is not where people expected that to be. And then I think there are quite some geopolitical tensions. So all in all, on the macro front, it's quite dynamic and quite challenging. If you don't specifically look into the semiconductor -- in the semiconductor industry, I think it's plain to say that our customers are really going through the cycle trough.
And if you just look at the number of characteristics there, what are some of the things that we are really looking at, we're looking at inventory positions. And there, what you see is that downstream, so let's say, with the end customers, we do believe that the inventory situation is starting to become more normalized. So I think there, we actually see a positive development. I think upstream, I think the inventory situation still needs to further normalize. So it's a bit of a mixed bag on the inventory situation.
I think as far as utilization of our tools is concerned, I think the progress that we started to see also in the previous quarter on the utilization of logic, we do see that, that progress is there. So we do see that on logic utilization is starting to improve. I would say on memory, quite frankly, I think we still need to see our customers turn the corner on the utilization front. So what does it do with our customers? What does it do with their expectations? What do they express to us? I think they do expect an inflection point at the end of this year. That's with all the dynamics that is what they typically would be looking at. But then obviously, the question is, what's the shape, what's the slope of the recovery into 2024? And that's obviously a dynamic that they're watching and that we're watching as well.
What we do see them do though is really prepare for continued ramp. So we do see quite a few fabs that are in the progress of being built and we do expect quite some fab openings in the '24 and '25 time frame. And obviously, that will require quite some tools. With the recent communication from the U.S. government on export controls, can you comment on the expected impacts to your DUV business? Yes. So it just came in. The new regulations, so obviously still in the process of digesting it and making a full analysis of what the impact is. So I can share with you our preliminary assessment and our preliminary assessment would be that as it pertains to our business, we think it affects a limited number of fabs in China. We don't think it has a material impact on 2023. And we also believe that if you look longer term, so for instance, if you look at '25 or 2030, the scenarios that we've given there, we believe it might have an impact on the regional split but we do not believe that it has an impact on, let's say, the overall revenue numbers that we would be looking at in those scenarios for ASML.
Main reason being, as you know, that we make those assessments not on the basis of the bottom-up demand in a country but really based on the worldwide demand for wafers. So that's the situation on that front. Obviously, we will fully comply with all the laws and regulations. So we'll diligently go through it but that is at least our preliminary assessment. What does all this mean for your outlook for 2024 and beyond? We really think 2024 is going to be a transition year. And if you look at the 2 topics that we were just discussing, so we -- that we discussed, the macro environment, we talked about the situation within the industry. We talked about the industry and our customers navigating through the cycle trough on the one hand. On the other hand, the situation we just discussed on the export goals, our current view is that we're taking a more conservative approach.
And what does that mean more conservative approach is that we're really looking at 2024 in 2 regards. On the one hand, we think revenue-wise, it's going to be similar, we believe, to 2023. And on the other hand, we believe 2024 is going to be a pivotal year in preparing us for what we think will be very significant growth in 2025. And there are a few building blocks why we truly believe that 2025 is going to be a significant growth year. First up, obviously, the secular trends, right? Everyone talks about the impact of electrification, of the energy transition, AI, et cetera. So those drivers are clearly there. The secular trends are very, very strong.
Secondly, we do see our current perspective that 2025, we will find ourselves on the uptick, if you like, in the cycle. So that should be a positive. We're also looking at continued strong litho intensity in our business. And as I mentioned before, if we look at the fab openings that our customers have scheduled for '24 and '25, it's pretty significant and that should all come together and essentially make for a strong 2025.
So that's why, if you take it all together, all the dynamics that we just talked about, we remain very, very confident in our expectations for the growth trajectory for ASML. And as also clarified in the expectations that we articulated on 2025 and 2030 in the Capital Markets Day of November of last year.","revenue came in at EUR 6.7 billion, which was around the midpoint of the guidance . net income for the quarter, EUR 1.9 billion and then order intake, EUR2.6 billion, lower than what we had in previous quarters . but in the current environment, customers are very cautious with cash .",0.0
2024-01-24,24,1,2024,773.9834594726562,0.2821976483739952,0.0,0.9998,Earnings Call Transcript Q4-2023,"Mr. Dassen, can you give us a summary of the fourth quarter 2023? Revenue for the quarter came in at EUR 7.2 billion, which was higher than guided, primarily driven by the fact that the installed base business at EUR 1.6 billion was higher than we expected. And that was both as a result of higher service revenue and higher revenue from upgrades.
That fact, so the higher installed base business, also drove up the gross margin. So gross margin came in at 51.4%, also higher than the guidance as a result of, as I mentioned, the higher installed base business.
Net income for the quarter came in at EUR 2 billion. And after a few soft quarters, the order intake for the quarter was very, very strong. Actually, a record order intake at EUR 9.2 billion. If you look at the composition of that, it was about 50-50 for Memory versus Logic. And around EUR 5.6 billion out of the EUR 9.2 billion was related to EV, both Low-NA and High-NA. And what about ASML's results for the full year '23? So for the full year, revenue came in at EUR 27.6 billion, with a gross margin of 51.3%. And we ended the year with a total net income of EUR 7.8 billion and also an order book -- a total order book of EUR 39 billion. Can you give us an update on the impact of fast shipments on 2023 and 2024? My favorite topic. So it comes to fast shipments, as you know, in the course of 2023, we changed the testing protocol for immersion tools on fast shipment, and we agreed those with customers. And as a result of that, we could recognize revenue again upon shipment. So that's for immersion.
When it comes to EUV, earlier on, we said that we expected around EUR 2.3 billion of value of fast shipments at the end of this year for EUV shipped but not yet recognized in revenue. That turned out to be quite a bit lower, EUR 700 million, and there's a few reasons for that.
First off, we had a couple of tools that were originally scheduled for shipment in, let's say, the last couple of weeks of '23. That actually slipped into the first couple of weeks of '24. And then secondly, we had some shifts in demand from customers that also led to a few tools slipping into '24. So as a result of that, the value came in at EUR 700 million rather than at EUR 2.3 billion.
That said, for 2024, we expect, at the end of 2024, that we will not do fast shipments for EUV. Main reason being that we assume that we'll not capacity constraint for EUV in 2024 because of the additions of -- additional capacity that we've been talking about. And that means that in our guidance when we talk about our expectation, '24 revenue being similar to '23 revenue, the revenue from these fast shipments, so the EUR 700 million, but also these tools that slip from 2023 into 2024, that's included in that expectation. Further to 2024, can you provide an initial outlook for the full year? So yes, I mean, as we said last quarter, clearly, there is still uncertainty. There are uncertainties at the macro front. And also, I think it's clear to see that our customers are navigating through the downside of the order cycle. So they're really making that move right now. And as a result of that, I think the question really remains, as it was -- as we expressed it last quarter as well, what's the shape of the recovery?
Yes, recovery is there, but what's the shape of the recovery? And how fast is that recovery going to be? And I think that's still unclear. That said, I do believe there are a few positive signs. And I think it is important to recognize those as well. So one positive sign is that we clearly see that the inventory levels in the end markets are getting to -- are improving and are definitely at a better level than we were a couple of quarters ago. So there is a clear improvement on the inventory situation in the end market. So that's one positive development.
Secondly, if we look at the utilization of our tools, we clearly see that they are improving. They're not yet at what I would call normal levels, but they're clearly improving. And all the indications that we're getting is that we believe that, that improvement will continue to occur in the course of this year. So good development there.
And thirdly, clearly, the EUR 9.2 billion order intake that we talked about earlier on, I think, is also a clear positive indication. So few good data points, a few positive data points. But still, we believe it's too early to revise our guidance. So we would keep our guidance as we articulated it last quarter, which is that we believe that 2024 will be similar in revenue as 2023.
That said, we also set 2024 very much a transition year and a year in which we're really building up capacity. We're making good investments into our capacity because we believe 2025 is going to be a year of strong growth, and that's what we're preparing for in this year as well.
If we look at different elements in the composition of our revenue, I would say if we look at the end markets, I would say that we believe, on the Memory side, we believe there will be -- that memory will be bigger than 2023, in 2024. And that's primarily because we see no transitions there. And these no-transitions primarily support the increased demand for advanced DRAM. And then you should think about DDR5, you should think about high bandwidth -- high-bandwidth memory.
On the logic side, I would argue that we're looking at a small decline in comparison to 2023, primarily because of all the capacity additions that we've seen in 2023. I think it's fair to assume our customers will digest those capacity additions. So as a result of that, we believe that there, the growth will be a little bit smaller.
If we then look at the different technologies. On EUV, we believe that we're looking at an increase. From a revenue unit number perspective, we believe will have approximately the same number of units of EUV in revenue, and that includes the things that we talked about earlier on, the fast shipment and units, et cetera, are included in that estimate. But we will benefit in EUV from higher ASP because we'll have a bunch of 3800s in our revenue with a higher ASP. And also we'll benefit from 1 or 2 EXEs or High NA tools that we'll have in revenue. So I think for EUV, we expect an increase.
As it comes to non-EUV system sales, as a result of the flat guidance, we believe that we'll see a small decrease there, and that will be primarily related to immersion. So we expect to have less immersion sales in 2024 in comparison to '23.
And as it comes to installed base business. On the installed base, we believe that will be flat in comparison to last year. And then finally, in terms of the composition over the quarters, we believe that the momentum will build during the year 2024. And as a result of that, we expect the sales level, the revenue level in the second half will be higher than in the first half of 2024. What are your expectations for gross margin this year? Yes. So in 2023, we ended at 51.3% gross margin. We expect that this year, we'll be slightly below that number. A number of puts and takes there again. I think if you look at EUV, we talked about the introduction of the 3800. So that would have a positive impact on the gross margin. And also, we expect that the service gross margin for EUV will improve. So that's positive.
But as I also mentioned, we'll have less immersion, and that will have a negative impact on the gross margin. And also, as we also mentioned in previous quarters, this really is an investment year as well. We're investing for the capacity expansion that we'll take benefits from in 2025, so significant investments there. And also we're very much investing in our capability, both in the factory and in the field as it relates to High NA. So those are drags, if you like, on the gross margin. And if you add that all up, we think that the gross margin of '24 will be slightly below the gross margin for '23. And what about your gross margin for 2025? As you know, for 2025, we gave an expectation at the Capital Markets Day of a gross margin range between 54% and 56%. And we still believe that, that is the right window to look at. I recognize that's a jump from the gross margin that I just -- expectation that I just gave for 2024. We have good reasons for that.
First off, of course, in 2025, if you look at the EUV mix, there will be substantially more high ASP tools in there than lower ASP tools in there. So I think that's an important element in there. Secondly, we'll have many more High NA tools in revenue in '25 than in '24, and they will be able to absorb the costs -- better absorb the total cost that we have for high NA. And even more importantly, as I mentioned, we are building capacity for '25. And of course, that should lead to, as we expect higher sales levels for '25.
So many more outputs for EUV and DPV. And that means that we should, in '25, will get the benefit of the investments that we make in '24. And if we combine all of those dynamics, then indeed, we believe that the 54% to 56% window for gross margin in '25 is the right number to look at. We just started the year. What's your guidance for the first quarter of 2024? So for Q1, we expect EUR 5 billion to EUR 5.5 billion of sales in that quarter with a gross margin expected to be somewhere between 48% and 49%. We expect installed base revenue of approximately EUR 1.3 billion. That's a bit of a soft start for the year. But that, I think, is very much in sync with what I told you earlier on that we really believe that the momentum is building up throughout this year. And we expect that the second half of the year will be better than the first half. Sales to China were very strong in 2023. How do you see this developing in 2024? And can you give us an update on the most recent export control regulations and how it's impacting your business moving forward? So you're fully right. The business in '23 with China was very, very strong. I should remind everyone that, that was also driven by the fact that we already had many orders for systems into China. And the majority of the sales that we have with China was actually executing on orders that were already there by the end of 2022.
I think we explained it last time, the order fill rate typically for China was fairly low in the past couple of years. It actually was below 50%. So with the shifts in demand that we had with other customers, that meant that we were able to execute on the demand that was clearly there in China, and that's why the China sales went up significantly in this year.
I should also say that those sales are really to mid critical and mature -- for mid-critical to mature manufacturing. I mean that's where the systems are going to. And that demand is very, very solid. It was solid last year. We expect it to be solid this year and also on a go-forward basis because of all the dynamics that are going on in China, we believe that, that will remain solid.
In terms of export controls, you're right. I mean, last year, we had Dutch rules kicking in and we had additional U.S. rules kicking in. We actually sought clarification with the authorities on the interpretation of those rules, and that really confirmed the expectation and the interpretation that we gave in our update on Q3.
In that sense, what it means that we should now expect that for 2024, we will not get export licenses for shipment into China for, let's say, advanced immersion, so 2000 and up tools. And we should also expect -- for a handful of fabs, we should expect not to get export licenses for China for 1970 and 1980 immersion tools. So that is the interpretation that we had in Q3, and we had that confirmed in follow-up conversations with the authorities.
In terms of what that does, as you recall, we said on -- in Q3, we said that we believe that between 10% to 15% of the China sales in 2023 would be affected by this rule. So if you look at the impact that these export regulations that were articulated in '23, the impact that, that will have on the '24 sales, we confirm that we believe that will be somewhere between 10% to 15% of the China system sales in 2023. Can you update us on your capital allocation plans? Yes. So we had a few soft quarters, but this was a strong quarter in terms of cash generation. So I think that was clear. And that, to a large extent, I think that was also related to the fact that we had a significant order intake, and as a result of that, we had an uptick in down payments.
The strategy -- capital allocation strategy and policy, by itself, hasn't changed, right? So we still -- whatever cash we need in order to make the investments into the business for capacity, for technology, et cetera, et cetera, that's the first deployment of the cash.
Secondly, we have a policy of growing dividends. And as it comes -- and growing dividends, which are paid out on a quarterly basis, and as it comes to this year, we will pay an interim dividend in Q1 of EUR 1.45 per share. And we will recommend to the AGM to declare a final dividend of EUR 1.75 per share in the AGM. And that would bring the total dividend for 2023 up to a level of EUR 6.10 per share, which would be a 5.2% increase over last year's dividend. And then whatever is left will be paid back to shareholders by way of share buybacks. Regarding your longer-term outlook, what are your expectations on demand and your business beyond 2024? So essentially unchanged, I would say, in comparison to what we said last quarter. So we -- if we start looking at 2025, as I mentioned before, we are looking at a year of significant growth. And that is for a couple of reasons. First off, we think the secular trends in our industry are still very much intact, right? If you look at the developments around AI, if you look at the developments around electrification, around energy transition, et cetera, they will need many, many semiconductors. So we believe the secular trends in the industry are still very, very strong.
Secondly, I think we clearly, by 2025, we should see our customers go through the up cycle, I mean the upward trend in the cycle. So that should be a positive. And thirdly, as we also mentioned last time, it's clear that many fab openings are scheduled that will require the intake of quite some tools in the 2025 time frame.
So we view 2025 as a strong year of growth. Now we are making the investments, as I also mentioned before, in 2024 in order to be able to create the capacity that will be needed in '25, but also will be needed to cater to the demand that we talked about in the Capital Markets Day earlier on in 2030. So we see strong growth, and we believe we need to prepare for that growth.
And talking about Capital Markets, you can put it into your calendar. We expect our next Capital Markets Day to be on November 14 of this year. I really look forward to seeing you there, and discussing with you the good growth opportunities that ASML has for the foreseeable future.",revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 came in at EUR 7.2 billion . that was primarily driven by higher service revenue and higher revenue from upgrades . the higher installed base business also drove up the gross margin . a record order intake of EUR 9.2 billion was related to EV and high-NA .,1.0
2024-04-17,17,4,2024,973.089599609375,0.2572485725630069,0.0,0.9998,Earnings Call Transcript Q1-2024,"Mr. Dassen, can you give us a summary of the first quarter? Net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 5.3 billion, included in there EUR 1.3 billion for Installed Base business. That EUR 5.3 billion was smack in the middle of the guidance that we provided last quarter.
As to gross margin, that came in at 51%, 51% was better than what we guided. A couple of reasons. First, there were some mixed effects. There was a bit more immersion and EUV in there in comparison to the dry business. There were also some one-off effects in there that drove up the gross margin to 51%. Net income for the quarter at EUR 1.2 billion.
In terms of order intake, the order intake came in at EUR 3.6 billion, included in there EUR 656 million for EUV. There's been quite some speculation, I have to say around the order intake for ASML. So it's maybe good to make a few comments on the order intake and also how people might want to look at that on a go-forward basis.
So first off, I think it's important to recognize that the order intake over the past 6 months. So if you take the Q4 and the Q1 order intake together, you're looking at nearly EUR 13 billion, which I think is a pretty significant number.
I think people have recognized by now that the order intake process is typically quite lumpy. But I think it's good to also look a little bit at what do we need in order to get to the different scenarios that have been articulated for 2025.
So maybe bring back to people's mind in the Investor Day for 2022. We were looking at different scenarios for revenue for 2025. And there was a bandwidth between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion for the 2025 net sales. And then if you try to look at it from that vantage point, if you try to look at the backlog that we have today, the question then is if you want to get, let's say, to the midpoint of that bandwidth that we provided, so the EUR 35 billion, what do you still need?
So if you look at, what's in the backlog today for '24, for '25, beyond '25, then in the next 3 quarters, we would need a little bit over EUR 4 billion for the 3 quarters to come in order to, at the beginning of 2025, be fully booked for that midpoint. And what's your guidance for the second quarter? For the second quarter, we guide a net sales level of EUR 5.7 billion to EUR 6.2 billion, included in there would be EUR 1.4 billion of Installed Base business. And we're looking at a gross margin of between 50% and 51%. Have there been any changes to your outlook for the full year, 2024? Essentially, the way we look at 2024 has not changed. So as we said last time, we look at 2024 very much as a transition year. In terms of revenue, that means that we would be looking at revenue for '24, which is similar to the revenue that we had for 2023.
But we're really looking at that as a transition year in which the momentum is building up during the year. So that means a stronger second half than the first half and also really gearing up towards what we think is going to be a strong year of 2025.
And that is really backed up, I think, by some of the industry trends as we see them today. So we do see the utilization of our tools, both for Memory customers and for Logic customers, further improving. We do see that the inventory, particularly downstream inventory, is being navigated quite nicely and is being driven down to what we would see as normal levels.
So all of that, I think, is very much in sync with our expectation that we will see recovery for the industry in 2024. And that, as I mentioned, we are building up for a stronger year in 2025. And that means for us building a capacity and preparing for that ramp. And are there any changes to your view on margins for the year? Yes. I think for '24, I would say, margin, we set a little bit lower than the gross margin that we had in 2023. I would still be looking at that. I would still look at that similarly. We gave the different puts and takes to the gross margin for this year on the last quarter.
I would still look at that in a similar vein. I think important to recognize still that the gross margin for 2025, which would mean a pretty significant step up from the gross margin this year, that we still think about that the way we've mentioned that during the Capital Markets Day in 2022, which is somewhere between 54% and 56%. So a big step up. Why is that? Just reiterating the key points there. First off, the lion's share of our EUV tools, Low-NA EUV tools by 2025 will be 3800s, and that will come with a better ASP and also a better gross margin.
Also on the Installed Base business, we believe 2025 is going to be a stronger year. First off, because we continue to improve the gross margin that we have on service for EUV, but also because we believe that, with the recovery in the market as we see it, we believe that the update -- the upgrade business in 2025 will be better than what we've seen so far.
High-NA, we'll be looking at higher volumes for High-NA, so that will give us better fixed cost coverage for High-NA. We'll also look at the introduction in terms of revenue for the 5200, which also will come with a better gross margin profile.
And very importantly, as you know, we're very much investing this year in the ramp, right? The ramp for the second half, but definitely also for the ramp in 2025, and that means that we're already hiring people, training people in the factory, in the field.
The revenue of that and the benefit of that we will yield, particularly in 2025. So in 2025, really -- we will really utilize the higher capacity that we've been building over the past couple of quarters. And all of those factors combined will lead to this step up in gross margin to the 54% to 56% that we've been indicating in 2022. Let's have a look at EUV. Can you update us on the progress you make with your EUV technology? Yes. So I would say, pretty exciting both for Low-NA and for High-NA. If we look at Low-NA first off, in Q1, we shipped the first 3800 Low-NA machine to a customer for qualification purposes. As we mentioned before, it's a tool that comes with significant improvements in its specification.
So most notably, I would say, on the throughput side that we will see an increase in throughput from 160 wafers per hour to 220 wafers per hour in final configuration. So that's a 37.5% increase in productivity. So that's a big deal. But it also comes with better overlay. It comes with better imaging. So all in all, clearly a tool that will drive value for the customer in a big way.
So it will drive down the cost of ownership for the customers. And that also means that there is quite some customer interest in the tools. So you will also gradually see there that the second half of this year. But also as I mentioned in next year that the 3800 will become a more and more significant part of the EUV sales.
So -- and with the value that obviously, this tool is driving for the customer, also comes a better ASP for us and also a better gross margin for us. So that's the story, I would say, on Low-NA.
On High-NA, big moment obviously, that we could report in Q4 because that's when we started shipping the first modules of the High-NA tool to its initial customer. So that system, we're now in the process of installing.
We actually just very recently also started shipping the second tool -- the second High-NA tool to a customer. So I think really good progress on that front. At the SPIE conference in February, we could actually report first light, which was a big moment for everyone engaged that we were able to report that. And we also see the first images coming from the High-NA tool.
So all in all, I think very much on track and good progress. The industry is really excited around High-NA and for very good reasons because if you look at the specifications of the High-NA tool, it will provide a transistor density that actually is 3x of the transistor density that you will have with low-NA tool.
So it's a really big step up. And if you combine that as we do with similar productivity on the High-NA tool, as you have it for a Low-NA tool, it's very clear the value that it brings to customers. So for customers, there's a lot of interest in High-NA.
As you probably know, we have this joint ASML-Imec lab here in Veldhoven -- High-NA lab here in Veldhoven, where customers are working with the tool. Next couple of weeks, we hope to really see the first wafers being exposed with that tool, and that's again a big moment for us because that means that our customers can really experience the tool, can understand how they are going to insert that tool into their road map.
So big interest from customers in working with this tool in the lab. And obviously, something that is further going to drive up the adoption of High-NA in the production road map for our customers. Then your capital allocation plans, can you update us on that chapter? Absolutely. So policy hasn't changed and start sounding like a broken record here, but we first use the cash that is generated to support the business and then whatever is left will be distributed back to shareholders.
And when you talk about what is needed in the business, in the current circumstances that we're looking at for customers, you really see customers working their way back to profitability, working their way back to higher cash levels.
In that circumstance, we still support customers just as we did last year. So that is still going on. And on the other hand, as I mentioned, we're looking at momentum really being increased over the quarters to come, leading up to what we think is going to be a very strong 2025.
And that momentum being built up, obviously also means that we're currently taking in quite a bit of inventory, quite a bit of material in order to be able to accommodate that, that ramp going forward. So that obviously puts pressure on the free cash flow. It has clearly put pressure on the free cash flow in the first quarter. Pretty sure that, that will yield and that investment will yield in the period to come.
On the dividend side, we paid EUR 1.45 per share in interim dividend in the last quarter. So we have proposed a final dividend of EUR 1.75 to the AGM. And if you add it all up, so 3x EUR 1.45 plus the EUR 1.75 final, means a total dividend for 2023 of EUR 6.10 per ordinary share. And finally, in terms of share buyback, we've executed share buybacks in the past quarter of around EUR 400 million. To close off, what are your expectations on demand and your business beyond 2024? So yes, I mean, there are still some uncertainties, I would say, primarily macro uncertainties. That's still clearly there. But as I mentioned before, if you look at the trends in the industry, if you look at and I'm kind of talking about the cyclicality trends in the industry.
So like the utilization going up, inventory downstream being managed to more normal levels. I think it's pretty clear that the industry is in its upturn and therefore, we do believe that by 2024, we're going to see recovery, clearly, a recovery of the industry.
So if I then fast forward to 2025, then what do we find ourselves in? Well, first off, I think we will find ourselves in 2025 in the midst of the upturn. So that's a positive.
Second we've talked about that many, many times, but the secular trends are really strong. I mean, if you look at AI, if you look at electrification, if you look at the energy transition, it's all very strong, very positive momentum behind it. So the secular trends are very, very strong. And that is also something that I think will yield in 2025.
And then finally, if you just look at all the fab openings that have been indicated by our customers. The recent news on positive outcomes of CHIPS Act money allocation. I mean all of that is very strong, very supportive, I think, for new fab openings across the globe.
And I think by 2025, you will see all 3 of those coming together; new fab openings, strong secular trends and the industry in the midst of its upturn. So that's why we're doing what we're doing, which is really preparing that ramp for that momentum that we see being built up.
And that's also the reason why also, not just for 2025, but also beyond that, we are having all these building plans. We are expanding our capacity to the 90 EUV tools of Low-NA, to the 600 DPV tools and to the midterm, 20 High-NA tools. So we're building that capacity because we believe it's needed, and we believe it's needed for what we think is going to be a very bright future for this industry altogether and for ASML in particular.
And just comparing notes on that is something that I very much look forward to that. As you know, we have a Capital Markets Day planned by November of 2024, the 14th of November. So we look forward to sharing our view on how the market is going to develop there, and really look forward to seeing all of you there.","net sales for the quarter came in at EUR 5.3 billion, included in there EUR 1.3 billion for Installed Base business . a couple of reasons: first, there were some mixed effects . there was a bit more immersion and EUV in there in comparison to the dry business, and then some one-off effects in there .",0.0
2024-07-17,17,7,2024,1066.2144775390625,0.09570020886778607,0.0,0.997,Earnings Call Transcript Q2-2024,"Hello, everyone. We published our Q2 results today, and I would like to take the opportunity to discuss this with you in more detail.
Q2 2024 was a good quarter. Our second quarter sales are just over EUR 6.2 billion. That's at the high end of our guidance, primarily driven by more immersion system sales. Our Installed Base Management came in at EUR 1.48 billion. This is slightly higher than guided, driven by increased service revenue. Our gross margin for Q2 is 51.5%, above our guidance. This is primarily driven by the product mix, more immersion systems. Net income for the quarter was EUR 1.6 billion. Our net bookings came in at EUR 5.6 billion, of which EUR 2.5 billion in EUV system. At the end of Q2, ASML had a backlog of around EUR 39 billion.
Now I will talk about the outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and I will give you our guidance for Q3. In Q3, we expect total net sales to be between EUR 6.7 billion and EUR 7.3 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 1.4 billion. For the third quarter, we expect a gross margin between 50% and 51%.
Our outlook for the full year 2024 has not changed. We expect revenue similar to last year. As indicated before, and based on our current guidance, the second half of the year is expected to be significantly higher than the first half. This is in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn.
Our guidance on market segment is similar to what we have stated in previous quarters. We expect Logic revenue to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to 2023, as customers digest the capacity added in 2023. For Memory, we currently see revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023. This is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transition in support of advanced Memory such as DDR5 and High Bandwidth Memory.
Our Installed Base business is expected to be flat relative to 2023. As we have said before, 2024 is a transition year. We continue to make investments both in capacity ramp and technology to be ready for the expected strong demand in 2025. Based on the different levers discussed in the past 2 quarters and the net impact on margin, we still expect a slightly lower gross margin in 2024 compared to 2023.
Now I also want to share with you some important update about our EUV technology. First of all, 0.33 NA systems. We have shipped additional NXE:3800E system this quarter, and we are continuing to ramp as planned. As customers transition to the 3800E this year, we expect the majority of shipments in the second half of the year to be 3800E.
Regarding High NA or our 0.55 NA system, we have shipped the second system this quarter and our first system is running qualification wafer at a customer. The second system is also now under installation, and this is progressing well.
Our customer interest for High NA is high. They are using already our system in the joint ASML-imec High NA in Veldhoven for initial wafer exposures and developments. We have now achieved images with a resolution of 8-nanometer, which is a new world record. We are, with High NA, enabling an almost 3x increase in transistor density relative to 0.33 NA system. Our system in Veldhoven has exposed the first wafers for multiple Logic and Memory customers.
So all in all, good momentum on High NA, high interest, and we are progressing well against our customer expectations.
Let's switch now to our longer-term outlook. When it comes to demand and our business beyond 2024, we expect, as we discussed in previous quarters that the overall semiconductor inventory levels, we continue to improve. We also see today further improvement in litho tool utilization levels at both Logic and Memory customers. While there are still uncertainties in the market, primarily driven by the macro environment, we expect a continued industry recovery in the second half of 2024.
We currently see strong development in artificial intelligence driving most of the industry recovery and growth ahead of other market segments. Based on discussion with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors, as mentioned last quarter. The secular growth driver in the semiconductor end market are still very much intact. The energy transition, electrification and artificial intelligence will continue to drive demand. We also see an expanding application space along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes. This will also drive demand for both advanced and mature nodes.
The industry expects to be in a cyclical upturn in 2025. As a result, we need to prepare for a number of new fabs that are being built today across the globe. Those fabs will be spread geographically and are strategic for all our customers. They all scheduled to take our system. It's essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth. We have discussed this long-term growth in our Investor Day in November '22. There, our annual revenue forecast for 2025 was between EUR 30 billion and EUR 40 billion. Our opportunity for 2030 annual revenue was between EUR 44 billion and EUR 60 billion. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024.
In summary, although there are still near-term uncertainties, primarily driven by the macro environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity.
Thank you very much for joining me today.","Q2 2024 was a good quarter. Our second quarter sales are just over EUR 6.2 billion . this is slightly higher than guided, driven by increased service revenue . our gross margin for Q2 is 51.5%, above our guidance .",0.0
