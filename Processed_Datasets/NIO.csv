With that, I will now turn this call over to our CFO, Mr. Louis Hsieh. Louis, please go ahead. Thank you, Jade. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining our inaugural earnings conference call today. On behalf of William and the entire NIO team, we are excited to report our first quarter as a public company following the listing on the New York Stock Exchange on September the 12th. We would like to thank our employees, investors and particularly our users whose support has allowed us to continue our journey to fulfill our mission and to execute on our strategies.
We are pleased to report a solid set of financial results for the quarter. The smooth ramp of our JAC NIO manufacturing facility led to the production of over 4200 ES8s and the brand new direct delivery system procedures that we’ve created successfully delivered 3258vehicles in the third quarter. That generated revenues of over RMB1.4 billion, up substantially from the second quarter.
Deliveries of the ES8 in October reached 1573, slightly below its September number due to the anticipated slower deliveries in early October, when vehicle registration offices were closed for the seven day Golden Week national holidays in China. We utilized the time during the slower holiday period to modify our production line in our JAC NIO plant to prepare for the future launch of our ES6.
We remain confident that our Q4 deliveries will be on the range of 6700 to 7000 vehicles, which leads to our reaffirmed guidance for the number of ES8s deliveries will reach 10,000 in the second half of 2018.
We expect to finish production of all founders addition ES8s within the next few weeks and plan to deliver the vast majority of them by the end of the year as vehicle registration procedures allow. We plan to start to deliver a small number of base edition ES8s in the production order pool in early December. In the future, as our production continues to ramp, our target is to deliver ES8s to our users within two to three months after production order deposits are received.
The ES8s have been delivered to over 170 cities in China with over 5,000 vehicles in operation. We have received valuable feedback from our users. Users have lauded the powerful solid acceleration while also providing reliable braking and other safety features. Users have also noted that the spacious and comfortable interiors with a well thought out design for families.
Users that compare the driving performance of the ES8 to well-known established premium brands such as Mercedes, BMW, and Audi or to test the Model S and Model X, the only premium SUV brand in China and find that ES8 very competitive or even better in a variety of performance specifications while providing a much more luxurious and spacious interior and comfortable ride with customized entertainment system and applications for an enjoyable driving experience.
NOMI, the first voice-enabled deep learning AI digital system installed in the Chinese premium cars has won the hearts of ES8 users. Users tell us NOMI access an intelligent and human life companion that makes driving much more fun.
Starting from this month, we are rolling out an upgrade to the ES8 software Version 1.1.0, the first over-the-air software upgrade in our history. Version 1.1 turns on a 360 degree camera view around the vehicle to assist in parking and provides a positive safety assistance or active safety assistance such as forward collision warning, FCW, and lane departure warning, LDW, as well as improving many other functions to make driving safer, and more pleasant.
Thinking beyond the delivery of our vehicles, we continue to expand our service network and enhance our service capabilities. As of today, we have twelve NIO Houses open in ten cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shenzen, Suzhou, and Chengdu, and Hefei,.
We also have another nine pop-up NIO Houses open in large cities where we see increasing demand for the ES8 and brand recognition of NIO. We currently have 38 service centers across 20 cities, mainly in authorized service centers. Our worry free services are highly praised by our users with over 90% of the ES8 users purchasing the worry free service packages.
Service teams are working diligently to make – sorry to make great service a hallmark of NIO’s brand and users’ experience. The third quarter was also a critical to monitor our users utilize our full range of power solutions including NIO home chargers, NIO Apps, power maps, power trucks, power swaps and one click power services.
More than 70% of the ES8 owners thus far have installed home chargers in their own parking spaces which gives them the most convenient and cost-effective charging solution. We have 295 power trucks covering 21 cities and swaps stations within 16 cities at the end of September. That is in addition to a growing infrastructure of public chargers across the country and the NIO App has the location information for more than 130 public charging piles.
All of these resources are accessible to the NIO apps which provides users with one click service to these charging solutions. The total number of one click services just exceeded 10,000 last week demonstrating that the charging capabilities are well supported by flexible infrastructure investment, data-driven optimization and solid execution.
Speaking of growing user community, we engage with the growing user community through offline and online platforms. Our NIO app has over 626,000 active users in total and more than 170 active daily users by the end of September – by the end of October. We are pleased with the way our brand and our vision of a joyful lifestyle have been received by our users and we are excited to continue to grow the NIO community.
We have built a strong team to support our future growth. Our focus remains deliver vehicles at the highest quality, to further improve the user experience and to prepare a successful launch of our ES6.
I would now turn the call over to our Vice President of Finance, Mr. Nick Wang to provide the financial details for the quarter. Nick, please? Thank you, Louis. Speaking as one member of the NIO family, I echo Louis’ sentiments and I am very excited about our prospects for the future. Our solid third quarter results get us off to a strong start following the first full quarter of production and deliveries. I will now go over some of our financial results for the third quarter of 2018.
To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB1.47 billion or US$214 million representing an increase of 3,095.3% from the second quarter of 2018.
Our total revenues are made up of two parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales were RMB1.43 billion or US$207.8 million representing an increase of 3,113.8% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase over the second quarter of 2018 was attributed to an accelerated delivery of the ES8 in the third quarter. Remember, that we only started making deliveries of the ES8 in the last three days of June. So, our second quarter sales figures reflects sales from June 28, through June 30.
Other sales were RMB42.7 million or $6.2 million representing an increase of 2,581.8% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase over the second quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to increased revenues recognized from the home chargers installed in the third quarter. Cost of sales was RMB1.6 billion or US$230.9 million representing an increase of 696.2% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase over the second quarter of 2018 was mainly driven by the delivery volume of the ES8.
Our gross margin was negative at 7.9%, compared with the negative of 333.1% in the second quarter of 2018, mainly driven by the larger scale of production and delivery of the ES8. We expect gross margin to turn positive in the quarters ahead and as production and deliveries increase.
Research and development expenses were RMB1.02 billion or US$149 million representing an increase of 37% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 33.7% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily attributed to the three items, number one, increased share-based compensation expenses recognized related to stock option granted to the company’s employees.
Number two, an increased number of personnel related to product and software development teams; and number three, increased development expenses of the ES6, the five seater premium electric SUV which is expected to be launched in the end of 2018.
If we exclude share-based compensation expenses, R&D expenses were RMB947.3 million or US$137.9 million. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.7 billion or US$243.2 million representing an increase of 208.9% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 74.6% from the second quarter of 2018.
The increase in SG&A expenses of the second quarter of 2018 was also primarily attributed to three items, number one, increased share-based compensation expenses, number two, an increased number of personnel related to user development and service-related teams and number three increased selling expenses for test drives and other promotional events.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses non-GAAP, SG&A expenses were RMB1.3 billion or US$192.5 million.
Loss from operations was RMB2.8 billion or US$409.1 million, representing an increase of 118.2% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 49.9% from the second quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP, adjusted loss from operations was RMB2.3 billion or US$346.2 million.
Operating margin was negative 191.2%, compared with a negative of 4,076.8% in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP, adjusted operating margin was negative 161.8%, compared with negative 3,938.9% in the second quarter of 2018.
Share-based compensation expenses were RMB432.2 million or US$62.9 million, representing
an increase of 2,380.6% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 581.2% from the second quarter of 2018. The increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily attributed to increased share-based compensation expenses recognized because of the successful completion of our IPO. We recognize the SBC expenses related to the stock options granted to the company’s non-US employees whose grants included a condition of an IPO which was a significant one-time, non-cash charge and won’t recur in the future at a similar level.
Net loss was RMB2.8 billion or US$409.2 million, representing an increase of 116.1% from the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 56.6% from the second quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses non-GAAP and adjusted net loss was RMB2.4 billion or US$346.3 million in the third quarter of 2018.
Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders was RMB9.8 billion or US$1.4 billion. Accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value were RMB6.9 billion or US$1billion and RMB31.4 million or US$4.6 million respectively in the third quarter of 2018. Accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value was a non-cash event and will no longer recur after the company’s IPO.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders non-GAAP was RMB2.37 billion or US$345.1 million.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB42.59 or US$6.20. Excluding share-based compensation expenses non-GAAP, accretion on convertible redeemable preferred shares to redemption value and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB10.35 or US$1.51.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB9.2 billion
Or US$1.3 billion as of September 30, 2018.
And now, for our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company expects: Deliveries of the ES8 to be in the range of 6,700 and 7,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 105% to
114% from the third quarter of 2018. And our total revenue to be between RMB2.87 billion to RMB2.99 billion or from US$418.5 million to US$436 million an increase of approximately 95.6% to 103.8% from the third quarter of 2018.
This business outlook reflects the Company’s current and preliminary view on a current business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Dan Galves of Wolfe Research. Please ask your question. Hello, and thank you for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about how order flow has progressed over the last couple of months? Also, how do you think things are going in terms of awareness of the product, brand recognition and what are you doing to actively grow awareness? Okay, thank you, Dan. Good morning. Great question. I think, for order flow, it has remained relatively stable. So, we – right now, as far as – I know your question relates to backlog. Right now, we’ve delivered over 5300 vehicles and we expect to deliver about 2500 each of the next two months. So, November and December each to reach our 10,000 goal. The – every day, we are receiving between 50 and 80,sine at the 100 new orders from the RMB5,000 deposit. And our RMB45,000 production order deposit is healthy with a backlog right now over 5,000. So, order and demand remains solid. We are not doing that much as far as any kind of direct marketing, but we have opened up more NIO Houses. Most of the ones we mentioned earlier of the 12 were opened in the last couple months. So, they are beginning to get a lot more visitors. Our App currently now has 626,000 active users. So, we are getting awareness throughout the country, plus we have 5,000 cars on the road. So, people are beginning to talk about NIO. And William, do you want to? Yes, hi, Dan. I will speak in Chinese and you help me to translate. [Foreign Language - Chinese]
[Interpreted]
Just like Louis mentioned, our community is growing rapidly and gradually. By the end of October, we have around 626,000 users and the DSU is around 170,000. As you can see, the brand awareness is increasing in the market and our delivery strategies are also growing quite smooth. We are now doing the users referral and scenario-based test drives. All these helped us to get more new users and we think this is well received among other users.
We think the user referral is a very good approach because the one user in Wenzhou actually gives the recommendation to around ten users and we are quite confident with the word of mouth of reputation building in the market. That’s great information. Thank you very much. One more question. You said that, that you plan to have positive gross margin in the quarters ahead. Can you talk about some of the most important items and the plan to improve the gross margin from where it was in Q3? Like, what are the levers? What are the mechanisms to improve gross margin? Go ahead, Nick. Yes, there are two major components in the gross margin. One is the building material and material cost, the other one is the fixed cost. We anticipate improvement on these two areas in Q4, because of a better economy scale and better leverage we have with our supply chain. Okay, thank you very much. We expect the gross margin to improve and we expect the vehicle margin with – if we hit our delivery to 7,000 this quarter, to turn the vehicle margins will definitely turn positive if we hit the 7,000. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nick Lai of J.P. Morgan. Please ask the question. Yes, thank you, William and Louis and Nick. I am Nick Lai from J.P. Morgan. Yes, two very quick questions. First, building of margin, can you share with us our view that you probably are looking to in 2019? And after taking into account of two major factors, one is potential subsidy and another one is cost drop on battery side I mean, expecting battery cost to come down? And secondly, can you share with us the number of shipments and production in the third quarter, production was 4200 and shipment was 3200 is there any bottleneck that should be aware? Thanks. The bottleneck is really – is not bottleneck other than just getting our logistics system set up correctly. This is new to us and then, also there is – as you know in China, most of the registration systems have a waiting list. So it takes time to get through the registration of the license plates. The factory is running relatively smoothly. We did – during the golden week holiday, as we did close – we didn’t close it, but basically, didn’t produced cars, but used it to revamp our line. So they can produce both ES8s and ES6s and also custom made just specific orders for customers.
What was your earlier question, Nick? I am sorry. I forgot the first one. Gross margin. The gross margin is something we don’t know that will be set at the end of this year. Okay, so. [Foreign Language - Chinese]
[Interpreted] Of course, the subsiding in the next year will decrease. The government is asking for opinions and we think this is not going to affect our gross margin that much because the pricing includes the subsidy and this will not affect us that much, but this will affect the money paid from the users. And your earlier question about cost down, as I think, we expect some reduction in the cost of the battery and also in the - as we get the volume order. So, we – Nick and team are working very hard to get part of the 10% reduction on the cost of the vehicle production side. Okay? Okay, thank you. Also the – on the fixed cost side, because we are going to have the bigger volume next year, apparently, the fixed cost amortization piece as part of the GM going to become improved as well. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Hi, Louis, Nick, well, congrats on the results. You mentioned that you have modified production line to accommodate ES6 to be launched at year-end. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about the roadmap for launching the new model? Do you also try to build the backlog as well, and also what will be the key marketing strategy? And then I have a follow-up question. Thanks. [Foreign Language - Chinese]
[Interpreted] The ES6 has already gone offline this May in the powered production line in our Nanjing advanced manufacturing center and our plan right now is to do the official launch of ES6 at the middle of December. So, the whole company is now preparing for this launch event. The model of ES6 will also be make to order and our plan is we will start the delivery of ES6 next year probably around June and July. That’s great. Thanks, William and if possible, it will be very helpful to give us a sense of how you would expect gross margin to progress over time for ES6? For example, what’s the breakeven volume for gross margin for this smaller model is similar to ES8 or it will be easier for you to turn profitable at the gross margin level? I think the quick answer for that is pretty similar to ES8, I think on a per unit basis, because of the – a little bit lower attractive lower price point. On a per unit basis the margin, the contribution margins are little bit lower. But this can be well offset much larger volume provided by ES6, which basically means that fixed cost amortization is going to be less. We anticipate a similar level of that of ES8. [Foreign Language - Chinese]
[Interpreted] I would like to mention another point that as we get ES8 and ES6 share the components at a large extent and we also use many supply chain partners for the ES6 and ES8 at the same time. So it means that ES8 and ES6 volumes will significantly improve the gross margin of both of the models. That’s great. Thanks, very much. Thank you. Thank you, Fei. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Ha of Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Hi, good evening, William, Louis and Nick. Congratulations on t he decent set of results for the first quarter after listing. I have two questions and let me ask the first question first. Earlier Louis mentioned that we currently have 12 NIO House and also 46 service centers already on the ground. Now just want to get quick highlight – quick summary or target of what – or how many new houses or service centers and other kinds of network that we plan to achieve by the end of this year and probably by the end of next year? And what would that be implying to the operating expense trend, would you see the SG&A trend going forward? That’s my first question. [Foreign Language - Chinese] [Interpreted] This year we will have one additional NIO House. This will open around December in Dongguan and next year, we will gradually open more NIO Houses. According to the sales plan, we think currently it will be around 20 to 30 NIO Houses, but we will adjust this plan according to the sales status and the order of the ES6 we will have a detailed plan for the first quarter of the next year. In terms of the service network, just now we mentioned that we have already delivered our ES8 in over 170 cities. We think there is going to be more for the ES6 and we have the authorized service centers we think we will evaluate the existing market and adopt the most effective way to deploy our service network. We are quite confident with this efficiency. Vincent, to answer the last part of your question, the NIO Houses will cost about 1.5 million to set up, because these aren’t going to be in Beijing and Shanghai. It will be in a little bit smaller cities 1.5 million to 2 million. So that’s the cost – the operating cost will be about little bit less than that per city. Okay, all understood. Now the quick second question is, could you also update us on the percentage of customer who is opting for the battering leasing option and also the battery swapping covered service? Because, some key question that I’ve been keep getting from some investors that concern that if the battery swapping option is getting really, really popular, we may run into a risk of like having a big stock of replacement batteries and that could cover like - put some pressure on our cash usage. Could you give us an update on that? Thanks. To answer, I answer it at the easy part. The facts figures on a percentage of user to take battery leasing is 73% by the end of Q3 and I don’t have the percentage number for battery swapping. But our estimate is around a 6%, okay. [Foreign Language - Chinese] [Interpreted]
Just like Louis mentioned, we have already got over 10,000 one click power services and most of the power services is delivered by the power truck. And in terms of the situation we are quite unexpected in terms of the home charger installation because we have a 76% of users who can install the home chargers. And this suggest that average income and the status of the home charging facilities is much better than we expected. This cannot help us to reduce the infrastructure investment.
This is a holistic solution because, we noticed that in some cities users do not need to use their car by their way when the car is out of power. So it means that we can use the power trunk or the faster charging facilities to solve the users’ issues. But, for other highways, we noticed that users would like to have a fast access and they would like to get the cars back very soon. It’s quite different from those cities. So it means, that this will affect power swap’s deployment strategy. In urban area we do not need to deploy a lot of power swap stations, but we would like to deploy more power swap stations in the highways. For example, in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl Delta, we would like to deploy more power swap stations, but this can also help us to control the cost because in those highways we just need to rent three parking spaces due to the power swap stations and we do not need to do any kind of civil constructions. So, we think this can help us to control the cost and we just need to evaluate the growth of our users and the scope of our users to come up with – a plan in terms of the power swaps deployment. Vincent, we monitor this very closely. So, as William said, it depends on the demand. As of September 30, we are in 16 cities with power swaps are delivered over 30 swap stations. But it depends on current need. We are pleasantly surprised that over 70% of the people are installing home chargers, which is the best solution, right. And also, the power trucks are quite heavily used. So if that meets their needs, then that’s fine. So, we basically, when we deliver the best service by monitoring consumer and our user demand and feedback. So, we won’t overbuild, but we want to make sure we meet their charging needs. Yes, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Next question is from Paul Gong of UBS. Please ask your question. Hi, good evening management. I have two questions. The first one is, still regarding the orders. Did I recall it right that at this moment, you have about 5,000 active backlog, after 5,000 of the 300 – 5,300 of delivery? Does that means some earlier orders who has paid the 5,000 and we have actually cancelled the order? Is that’s a right on spending? And also given, right now, the order intake rate is roughly 50 to 80 per day, does that mean the intake and the deliveries in the next two months is roughly on battery charger is that’s a right on spending? Yes, I mean, it depends on obviously how many people do cancel. So, you are right, Paul, that some of the people – the original people who put in the RMB5,000 deposit have canceled, because they didn’t want to wait – as you recall, our ES8 was delayed by several months. And so, some of these orders date back to last December, or early January. So they were – we do have a number of cancellations. But as far as the order backlog, we delivered over 5,300 cars and the 45,000 production order deposit rate is over 5500. So, we are pretty comfortable that we will be able to deliver between 10,000 and 11,000 cars in the next couple of months. Our facility is producing very well. So, that’s the issue and then, every day we are receiving between 50 and 80 or so new orders for the 5,000 refundable deposit. But that one is subject to cancellation obviously. So, if I place an order today, I expect to receive the car within the next two months, is that’s the right expectation? Not currently, because the Founder’s edition need to be delivered first, the first 10,000. So, you can probably get it in three months – within three months. Three or four months, at most. Okay, but once we clear the Founder’s Edition, the first 8,000 or 9,000 cars then, we will begin to speed it up and that’s why we put in the new equipment. So, it can produce cars as a order-by-order basis in the Jose plant. It’s a major order base. Yes, sure. My second question is, regarding the Founder’s Edition and also the relatively cheaper ones, do you expect the fair margin derived from these edition and subsequent models or do you expect similar profit contribution per units? How do we think about this different margins and the intellectual… I think the newer cars, the orders after the Founder’s Edition should have slightly higher margin, because the Founder’s Editions were given a special. Right, there for RMB448,000, you know that really equivalent to 548,000 with full options. So the other ones who made the order, the ones who pick the options will have slightly higher gross margins. I think, one thing I want to add is that, the margin for the base model plus option versus the fully loaded Founder’s version, their margins is quite similar. But obviously, it’s a function of the option take rate. Maybe for the base model plus option, they are going to be more users who take our high-end option like Novi, maybe that’s going to contribute a lot of the margins to our product for sure. But, I think, we will obviously work the incoming orders from both the new user to order base model plus options coming in, we are going to see the beta, that’s going to become more clear to us. So, at this moment, if we expect similar margins for the base plus options at a blended average versus the Founder’s Edition, that is above the similar margin, that’s right? Similar. I think it maybe slightly lower, but again, we need to see the incoming order and then we can perform an proper analysis and we will be in a better position to tell. Sure. Thank you so much. That’s quite helpful. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions now, I would like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.

With that, I will now turn this call over to our CFO, Mr. Louis Hsieh. Louis, please go ahead. Thank you, Jade. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report our fourth quarter and first full year results as a public company. Our results reflect broad based accomplishments across our organization and provide us with a strong base for moving forward in 2019.
I'll begin with some highlights. In Q4 2018 production continue to ramp for our NIO JAC manufacturing sites and we delivered 7,980 ES8, during the quarter to bring our total deliveries to 11,348 units for 2018, which helped strengthen the ES8 brand and solidified our leadership position among premium electric 7-seater SUVs.
Revenues increased 134% sequentially from the third quarter and total revenue reached RMB 4.95 billion for the first year following our initial deliveries in June 2018. In December 2018 we launched the ES6, our 5-seater high performance premium electric SUV as well as the 6-seater ES8 version, with 7 passenger SUV in the past now we have a 6-seater version. These launches exemplify our focus on continued market penetration to enhance products and services.
We remain confident in our growth prospects in the coming year. We expect a greater than anticipated sequential decrease in deliveries in the first quarter of 2019, partially due to accelerate deliveries made in the end of last year in anticipation of EV subsidy reductions in China in 2019.
Number two, seasonal slowdown surrounding the January 1, and Chinese New Year holidays. Number three, soft macroeconomic conditions in China, particularly in the auto sector. As a result, we expect ES8 deliveries in the first quarter to total between 3,500 and 3,800 units. And we have completed 1,805 and 811 deliveries in January and February respectively.
In 2019 - by the end of February 2019, we had over 4,200 orders for ES8 with RMB 5,000 deposits and RMB 45,000 production order payments. Going forward, we will no longer report the pre order number for ES8 as deliveries of ES8 enters a short and more normal stage of delivery times. Furthermore, going forward, we will report delivery numbers each quarter rather than giving monthly updates.
We expect deliveries in the second quarter 2019 to reflect continue weakness as we await the result of the 2019 EV subsidy policy in China and improvements in the macroeconomic conditions. We continue to monitor policy changes in support of the EV industry and the subsidies offered to buyers of electric vehicles. Yesterday on March 5, in China the Chinese Central Government announced a reduction in the VAT tax from 16% to 13% for manufacturing industries as part of the overall tax reduction and information plan to boost the macro economy.
We believe these measures will benefit the overall economy and consumption markets in the long term, including the auto industry.
On another positive note in mid-December, we were excited to officially launch our ES6 with a pre-subsidy price starting from RMB 358,000. We are confident that the competitive features and prices of ES6 will lead a significant interest in the mass market. ES6 5-seater SUV possesses exceptional performance with acceleration from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in fastest 4.7 seconds; exceptional range of 510 kilometers NEDC [ph] and a fully featured luxurious interior. As at the end of February, we had already received over RMB 7,300, RMB 5,000 pre-orders.
We plan to generate additional interest in ES6 through participation in the high profile Shanghai Auto Show in April. We expect this order backlog to increase as ES6 show cars are delivered to our NIO houses in May. As potential buyers can actually see, touch and test drive and experience ES6's driving performance and comfort. As of the end of February, we have made good progress in preparing the production for ES6 we are on track to achieve our goal to begin deliveries in June of 2019.
The geographic reach of NIO's users continues to expand. Through the end of February 2019, our ES8 model has been delivered to 270 cities connecting users across the country. With over 14,000 ES8s now on the road, we continue to receive valuable feedback from users. Positive feedback remains brisk in key areas including driving function, interior quality, no mediator interactions, superior service and user engagement.
During the first winter, we heard from users about drive range challenges with the ES8 for long distance trips. Although our cloud data indicates that 95% of ES8 usage is in the city driving and only 5% is related to long distance travel. We accelerated our efforts to expand our highway power swap station network covering both the G2 and G4 expressways as well as the majority of the G15 expressway.
Now, new users can travel between Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen without stopping for hours with recharge simply by using NIO battery swap centers, which provide a fully swap battery within five minutes. NIO is the only company with battery swap technology to enable seamless long distance driving in China, China's main highways at ES8 akin to ICE cars and refueling convenience.
Reflecting our drive for continuous improvement, we continue to update and offer software to improve our user experience. Utilizing our over the air technology in December we upgraded our ES8 software to version 1.2.0. Over 200 functions have now been added to optimize to provide enhanced safety, driver convenience and improve the overall driving experience, since our first software version launch in June. Key among these include as ADAS functions such as automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and lane departure warning, we target additional major ADAS functions in the first half of 2019.
Our service network continues to grow. As of the end of February 2019, we opened 13 NIO houses and 16 pop up NIO houses in 27 cities across China. In addition by year end, our number of service centers increased to 166 cities, mainly composed of authorized service centers. We are pleased to report our worry free service package continues to receive rave reviews and are continue to see about 90% of our users purchase the worry free service packages.
We continue to monitor how users are utilizing available power solutions. As of the end of February 2019, approximately 78% of users have installed the home chargers, which are the most efficient and convenient charging solution for the daily usage. We also completed over 38,00 one click power service touch touching 64% of users.
Our power swap stations were also utilized actively in cities and on highways by 32% of our users. Add to this the more than 170,000 public chargers identified through our NIO approximately were utilized by 59% of our users. And it is clear our users are well served by flexible and growing charging infrastructure. We'll continue to monitor usage trends and evaluate our feedback as we continue to improve and enhance available power solutions.
In China, the Chinese New Year is the busiest travel season of the year. This year between January 28 to February 18 the heart of the holiday travel period we provide over 16,000 one click power services to our users, which earned a satisfaction rating exceeding 4.9 out of 5 in the post service surveys. We are proud of our NIO Power and NIO Service teams for their hard work to provide seamless exceptional support to NIO ES8 users on the road across the country.
Delivering a holistic user experience exceeds expectations is a key competitive differentiation and one that create significant barriers to potential competitive entrance. Because of this we continue to think beyond the delivery of our vehicles to ensure that NIO Service and NIO Power provide the highest quality service to the NIO community.
Our NIO community continues to expand beyond our users who purchase ES8. Our online NIO community is growing fast with a new app recording over 800,000 active users and 190,000 daily active users on peak days.
A highlight of 2018 for NIO community was our Annual NIO Day. In December, we hosted the Flagship NIO Day event in Shanghai and welcomed over 10,000 members of the NIO community to share insights into our vision for the future, as well as officially launching the ES6. This event has now been viewed online over 1.5 billion times. Through a variety of offline activities in 2018, we've gained valuable experience and data and with continued rolling out more offline activities to attract target users in 2019.
On a separate note, we would like to give you an update on our plan for building the manufacturing facilities in Jiading, Shanghai. In 2017, we signed a framework agreement and memorandums with the government and related entities in Jiading, Shanghai to build a manufacturing plant for NIO. Recently, we have agreed in principle that these contractual counterparties - with our contractual counterparties that terminate the plan at this manufacturing plant.
These decisions are made based on two reasons. First, in 2018, a new policy was issued by the government authorities, which allows and encourage the entities that operate its vehicle research, development and design to work with vehicle manufacturing companies to manufacture vehicles cooperatively. This joint manufacturing model between NIO and JAC, endorsed and perceived as an innovative manufacturing model in China.
Secondly, through an efficiency perspective, we can leverage the existing capacity of NIO JAC plant and enjoy the flexibility to expand the capacity to support NIO's market penetration and growth plans for the next two or three years.
In the long run, we will still focus on joint manufacturing model and continue improving the effectiveness of capital investments in manufacturing. 2019 is an important year for NIO. As we have a full year of production of the ES8 and begin deliveries of the ES6.
While soft economic conditions may temporary demand for some segments of the auto industry, in China the EV segment is expected to continue to grow. Our goals in 2019 center around increasing market penetration, but effectively improving our production and operation efficiency. Longer term we're committed to investing in the research and development to insure our products and experiences remain in the forefront of the EV industry and exceed our users' expectations.
As we complete our first six months as a public company, I would like to thank the growing NIO user community for their ongoing trust the diligent NIO teams for the commitment to our vision and the investor community for your interest and support of this journey with NIO.
Thank you again and I will now turn the call over to our Vice President of Finance, Nick Wang to provide the financial details for the quarter. Nick, please. Thank you, Louis. As Louis mentioned, we concluded 2018 on a strong note. I will now go over some of our financial results for the fourth quarter. And to be mindful of the length of this call I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for our full years and other additional details.
Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB 3.44 billion or $499.7 million, representing an increase of 133.8% from the third quarter of 2018. Our total revenues are made of two parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB 3.38 billion or $491.8 million, representing an increase of 137% from the third quarter of 2018 and accounted for 98% of total revenues in quarter. The increase in fourth quarter vehicle sales over the third quarter of 2018 was attributed to accelerate deliveries of ES8 in quarter.
Other sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB 54.4 million, or $7.9 million, representing an increase of 27.5% from the third quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter other sales over the third quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to increase the revenue recognized from the home chargers installed and service provided in the quarter.
Cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 was RMB 3.42 billion or $497.7 million, representing an increase of 115.8% from the third quarter of 2018. The increase in cost of sales over the third quarter of 2018 was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume of ES8s in the quarter.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2018 was positive 0.4% compared with negative 7.9% in the third quarter of 2018, mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the quarter. Vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was positive 3.7% compared with negative 4.3% in the third quarter of 2018. The increase of vehicle margin was mainly driven by the increase of production and the delivery volume of the ES8 in the quarter.
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB 1.52 billion or $220.4 million, representing an increase of 83.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 48% from the third quarter of 2018. The increase in research and development expenses over the third quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to the n increased number of personnel and the increase in design and professional expenses related to research and development activities of the ES6, a 5-seater high performance premium electric SUV launched in December 2018.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, fourth quarter research and development expenses were RMB 1.49 billion or $217.4 million, representing an increase of 83.1% from the fourth quarter of 2017, and the increase of 57.8% from the third quarter of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were RMB1.95 billion or $282.9 million, representing an increase of one with 130% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 16.5% from the third quarter of 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of the third quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to increased marketing and the promotional activities, increased expenditure on rental and other expenses related to the sales network expansion and an increase the number of selling, general and administrative employees.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure selling, general administrative expenses were RMB 1.83 billion or $265.5 million, representing an increase of 123.5% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 38.1% from a third quarter of 2018.

The increase in share-based compensation expenses over the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily attributed to increase option granted to employees in 2018. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the third quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to the higher accumulative share based compensation expenses recognized in the third quarter, which was related to the satisfaction of stock options granted pre-IPO to certain employees with the performance condition of an IPO.
Net loss was RMB 3.5 billion or $509.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, representing an increase of 106.1% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 24.6% from the third quarter of 2018.

And now for our business outlook, for the first quarter of 2019, the company anticipates a sequential slowdown in vehicle deliveries compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Due to accelerated delivery made at the end of last year in anticipation of EV subsidy reduction in China in 2019, the seasonal slowdown surrounding the January 1st and Chinese New Year holidays as well as the current moderate macroeconomic conditions in China.
For the first quarter of 2019, the company expects deliveries of the ES8 to be between 3,500 and 3,800 vehicles, representing a decrease of approximately 56.1% to 52.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The total revenues to be between RMB 1,390.9 million and RMB 1,515.7 million or between $202.3 million and $220.5 million, a decrease of approximately 59.5% to 55.9% from the fourth quarter of 2018.
This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator, to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Dan Galves from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about your expectations for the government EV subsidy policy. In 2019 when do you expect this to be announced? What are some of the positives and negatives? Will your the bigger 84 kilowatt hour battery help offset some of the reduction? And finally, do you expect more cities in China in 2019 to put restrictions or quotas on internal combustion vehicles? Thank you, Dan. William, do you want to answer this question? Yes, I can. So thanks for your question. I will speak in Chinese and Ruohe will help me to translate.
Right now we haven't received any official announcement from the government regarding the subsidy policies in 2019. And we expect that it will be announced officially recently. For the overall direction, we - although we haven't received any official announcement we believe that compared with last year the subsidy policy in 2019 will be decreasing significantly.
But if we look at the positive side as mentioned by the Chinese Government yesterday they will be keeping supporting NEV's development especially the support in terms of the taxations for the NEV especially for the pure electric vehicles there is no need to pay the purchasing tax for the buyers. And we believe that this support in the taxation will be continued. And we also believe that the advantages of the consumption tax on the electric vehicle will also continue.
And for NIO our product positioning taps into the premium segments, compared with other entry level brands and models. We will receive very limited effect from the decreasing subsidy, and on the other hand we do receive a lot of advantages with the taxations. So in the long run we will be in the advantageous position.
And another advantage of decreasing subsidy is that before we will deduct - before we have to deduct the subsidy for our users and we need to wait for the subsidy from the government. And it takes a very long time to wait for the subsidy from the government. And we need to pay some advancement payments and after the subsidy decreases actually we will receive - since we’ll receive more advantages with the taxations actually it will help us to release the pressure of the cash flow.
And in the long run, I believe that the Chinese policies will be supporting the EV's development. And I have this thought from two perspectives. The first is that there will be a lot of the benefits in terms of the use of electric vehicles. For example, the EV can drive freely in Beijing and in Shanghai we have advantages with the license plate applications of EV. And I believe that more cities will be enacting this kind of EV friendly policies in the future.
And secondly, we do receive a lot of benefits with the taxes. And for NIO as we are a premium brand, I believe this will help us to expand our market, especially we can take up the market shares of users who used to be the ICE car users.
So all sum up in the short-term, especially in the second quarter this year we will be facing some pressures, but the pressures on ourselves is much lesser than the pressure on other electric vehicle companies. And in the long run, we believe that we will keep receiving the benefits and advantages from the policies and this will help us to expand our market. Thank you, William. Dan also as far as your other question, Hainan Island has no inactive restrictive license plate restrictions. So Sanya and Haikou are also joining that list. So we expect many more cities in the next in the coming years to restrict the ICE license plates in those cities to prevent pollution and to move toward electric car future. Thank you. Next question? Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I would like to explore a bit more the implications of not building the wholly owned assembly plant in Shanghai. Presumably this could have a very positive implication for return on invested capital. Could you talk to about the potential impact on earnings relative to pursuing a wholly owned - relative not pursuing a wholly owned approach?
And then is there anything to think about, about the potential timing of expected future models? Does this development have the potential to either delay or perhaps even accelerate the timing of one additional model might launch beyond the ES8 and ES6? Okay. Thank you Ryan. This one I think I'll let William answer this. He's the most familiar with the plant situation. William you want to go? Okay. Thanks for the question. As we all know last November the MIP has enacted a very important file called No. 15 file and in this file it stated that the Chinese Government endorsed the cooperation between the car R&D companies like NIO, with the existing manufacturing companies or manufacturing plants that means that the cooperative mode between NIO and JAC is endorsed by the Chinese Government.
Of course a lot of details regarding this document still need to be finalized and we expect that on the 1st of June, the details and this document will be finalized officially and it will be opening for the applications and approval procedures.
And the advantages for NIO is that first of all we don't need to apply for the subsidies or the carbon emission credit, via JAC we can directly apply this from the government. And secondly for NIO as an independent car companies, we can manage our products very well and this will be helping us with our long-term strategic planning.
And we receive a lot of benefits from this and with this we can review and replan our investment in the manufacturing and we can also improve the management efficiency of manufacturing. So in the long run we will be upholding this manufacturing cooperative mode. At the moment JAC is our only manufacturing partner and in the future in the long run, we may embrace other partners in this regard and this will also be important part of our long-term strategy.
And currently because last year, during the second half of last year we have modified our production lines for both ES8 and ES6 production and now the annual capacity of NIO JAC manufacturing site is about 100,000 units per year. And recently we'll be having some discussions with JAC and we decided that our third model will also be manufactured in this new JAC manufacturing site. Of course to be compatible with the third model we need to make some investment and modifications in our production lines and we will undertake part of this investments.
And in this regard, our cooperative mode with JAC will continue and after the upgrade, the annual capacity of this manufacturing side will be about 150,000 units per year and this can be compatible with three models in the next two to three years.
And for the follow-up manufacturing plan, we may be working with other manufacturing partners with other manufacturing sites. But we will keep this cooperative mode in the long run, so that we can meet our satisfying capacity. And based on our working experience and cooperative experience with JAC, it takes about 20 months from planning to ramping up to the ideal capacity. And in the future, we will also uphold this so that we can meet our capacity demand. And we don't think this will be a bottleneck for the company's development and also it helped us to reduce the capital expenses.
As for the optimization of the 2019 capital expenses, because of this termination of Shanghai plant, maybe Louis or Nick, you can share some figures. Okay. I think based on this change of the strategy, I think it's definitely going to be some short-term and mid-term saving on CapEx sending for sure. And over long run, we believe that this can translate into a long-term higher return on asset as well. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Ryan. Next question? The next question comes from the line of Nick Lai from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning, William and Nick and Louis. Thank you for taking my question. Just one very simple question regarding the pricing strategy, can we talk about our long-term pricing, our medium term pricing strategy considering two moving parts or two moving factors, one is subsidy cut and second is potential localization of model three in first quarter? Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Nick. William, do you want to talk about our pricing strategy? Okay. And we'll be committed to adopting a more reasonable pricing strategy instead of just to reduce the price to take up the market share. And for ES8 and ES6 we have battery leasing package or policy, which means that user can get RMB 100,000 reduction if they chose this battery leasing service. And they only need to pay the monthly fee. And from the number perspective over 70% of our ES8 users have chosen this battery leasing service.
So in this regard, for ES6 users, they only need to pay about RMB 258,000 before subsidy and they don't need to pay the purchasing tax. And from the pricing perspective, our product can be very competitive in the markets. And we understand that our competitors had several rounds of price reductions recently. They may be facing some competitive pressures so they need to reduce this price. But I believe or I think this price reduction can damage the brand image and the loyalty of their existing users and consumers.
And in the long run, NIO will not tap into - NIO will not try to take up a bigger market share by simply reducing the price. Instead we want to innovate our service mode to improve our user satisfaction and user loyalties and then we can improve our sales and market share.
So I believe with our pricing strategy and battery leasing service, as well as the innovations with our service mode, we can keep our competitive edge in this market. And for this year to improve our brand awareness and market penetration, we will be hosting some test drive events or user experience events so that we can touch upon more users. Thank you, William. And Nick, I think in my view, the Tesla price reductions it is my opinion I think is impart directly because NIO is already - our ES8 are selling Tesla's top brands S and the X which is why price reduction was so significant, 15% to 20% is huge. And on Model 3 I think Model 3 is the base version which doesn't even compare close to our ES6 in performance or range is over RMB 400,000. As William just said ours just 258,000 if you take the battery lease options to start with. So I don't think it solves the competitive problem for Tesla in China. Yes, thank you William and Louis. I was actually - if we plan to release MSRP but thank you for the answers. Thank you. So ours is 358 theirs is about 410 the cheapest version. But the Model 3 is the small car it's not even the same class, it's a smaller sedan. It's like comparing 318i BMW, ours is more like an X5 the ES6. Our range is 510. Their range is about 300 kilometers. Our acceleration is a second faster than theirs, got to 60 in 4.7, theirs like 5.7 or 5.8. Theirs have a single motor, ours is dual motor. So it's not comparable. Indeed. Thank you, Louis. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Ha from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks management for taking my questions. I have questions on two areas. Number one is on the longer term counts of sales outlook. We noticed that the company is giving a more conservative guidance for first and second quarter. But does it really change our longer term expectation of around like 40,000 to 45,000 deliveries for the full year 2019? And what would be the split between ES6 and ES8?
And then a little bit follow up on the sales outlook. We recently saw a really positive documentary coming off from the 60 minutes of CVS. And I think that really helps to raise the awareness of the brand inside China. I wonder whether the company is trying to leveraging on these publicity to help on the sales and help the traffic in the NIO houses.
My second question is for the fundraising. Now congratulations on the successful like convertible notes raising last month. And my question on this one is that, can we have a rough idea of what is the cost for the options for the insurance? And then the second question, is that going forward is this likely to be the major way of further fundraisings in future? So those are the two questions. Thank you. Thank you, Vincent. This one I'll take the numbers question. The understanding is our forecast has not changed for 2019. As we said the slower than expected start in Q1 and Q2 will partly be due because the subsidy is normally announced in January in China this year it's already March. It hasn't been announced. So that uncertainty and we said the macro. The other thing is don't forget in February is only half a month because Chinese New Year took up the first 10 days of holiday.
We had some delivery delays in February due to the - getting license registration offices open in China. So the 811 is exceptionally low. So we expect a pickup in March of this year. And as I said, we have over 4,200 orders for ES8 that are in the bag 5,000 and 45,000. 1,300 of them are for the 6-seater version of the ES8. The 6-seater version won't be available until Q2. So it's not the slowdown as it is pronounced as it looks from the numbers. So I appreciate that question, Vincent.
On the 60 minutes article it's great publicity in the U.S. and outside, unfortunately 60 minutes isn't shown in China, but is a very positive view of Williams strategy and vision for the company.
On fundraising, the convertible bonds had - premium is a little bit higher than we like this coupon is 4.5% is a five year CB with three year put. I don't think CB will be the primary source of fundraising for us in the future we have many other sources of fundraising. We have enough cash to launch ES8 and ES6, but as you know because of a car company's nature we will need to tap the capital markets at some point in the future.
We also have credit lines available to us, we have a lot of strategic interest in investing in NIO through partnerships and others and also we have the ability do credit financing on the battery lease receivables we get in others to generate a significant amount of cash by - from our battery leasing and other revenues. You want to talk about fundraising more? Yes, actually there is two points I just want to add on top of what Louis just mentioned, essentially you're asking about the structure of the CB. In this transactions I think there are two elements of the derivative financial structure and derivative nature one is a capital upper straight that's basically shows the management the company's confident over the long run, especially the high appreciation of stock price that's basically - in that the elements that basically increased our straight price from 27.5% to 100%.
The other element that as we call it a zero straightforward shares essentially allow the company to purchase back some shares and make this shares lendable to the potential that CB investor in the marketplace. There's a typical practice in the market, in the CB market. Okay. Thank you. Does that answer your question, Vincent. Basically our forecast remains unchanged there may be slightly more ES8 orders since we already have 7,300 three or four months before launch. So we think that's a very strong number. And then ES8 I think will - Q2 should be better than Q1. But I think our ES8 is already the number one selling premium EV in the market already. So it's already out selling the Model X by a wide, wide margin. So it’s basically already the market leading position.
Next question. Your next question comes from the line of Fie Fang from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. It is very impressive to see the ramp up of ES8 volume and your brand. Can management talk about the operational lessons that you have learned from branding ES8? What have worked, what have not and would you plan to do differently for ES6 and the third model? And also for ES6, how do you think about the cannibalization risk with ES8? Thank you, Fie. William do you talk about lessons you've learned from branding ES8 and any cannibalization against ES6, with the ES6 cannibalizing ES8. Yes. Thanks for the question. ES8 is our first product and from manufacturing to delivery in terms of the readiness of supply chain, quality and software we need to improve a lot. And for the past six months, we've experienced a lot of challenges. And some days we need to manufacture at least 100 or 200 cars and we need to deliver that many cars every day. And this is a huge pressure for us. And I got to say we have overcome that period of time, and I will appreciate our team for this great contribution.
And as of today, we've delivered cars to 270 cities in China. And the geographical distribution of our users is quite wide. We even have users in the Northeast China, which is one of the coldest areas in China. And which means that we also face some pressures with our service. I cannot say this is a lesson learned, but for the last quarter - for the first quarter last year we do paid a lot of attentions with the user experience. For example, to guarantee a smooth car usage and experience in the winter we spent a lot of time with the user services in these areas.
And also because we didn't want to keep our users waiting for such a long time, we have some intensive user deliveries. And for these - for what we got from past quarter we think we can further improve our efficiencies with the services and service operations. And I believe this will be a long-term target and this will help us to further improve our user satisfactions.
And starting from this year, we believe that NIO has entered into the second phase of a competition we call it the qualifying round. And the priority of this round is that we need to improve our operation efficiency without compromising on the user satisfaction. This is one of the most important tasks at the moment. Thank you, William. Also I think in my view ES6 will - obviously will have cannibalization effect on ES8, but I think that's normal. They're both SUVs one is 5-seater, one is 7-seater. But I want to remind you that the 5-seater version, 5-seater SUV market is many times bigger than the 7-seater SUV market, which is very limited in China. So I think as the potential for ES6 is much larger in orders and is reflected in our half year forecast than ES8. So I think it's inevitable. Actually Louis has mentioned one important information, the market size of the premium 5-seater SUV is 10 times bigger than that of premium 7-seater SUV, which means that the total volume of the 5-seater SUV above the price of RMB 300,000 is over 1 million units. But that's also ES - that of 7-seater SUV is only about 100,000 units. And we care a lot about our overall market share instead of just for ES8 or ES6.
And for ES6, our target this year is to let more people to know this brand, to know this car and to try this car. That's why this year we are planning for a wide range of test drives around China so that more users or more potential users can have a try.
And for our existing users who tried or drove ES8 for a while actually the feedback is quite positive, because we understand the demand and the needs of the Chinese users and we are confident about the product we provide to them. And actually NIO has one of the highest user satisfactions and we also keep - want to keep improving this user satisfactions.
If you read some self-generated content on the social media they have some attractive titles criticizing about NIO's services, competitiveness or our product. But if you look at the real user feedback, you will find that the feedbacks from our users are quite positive. And in the long-term, I believe this is a foundation to our future competitiveness. Thank you, William. Next question? Your next question comes from the line of Paul Gong from UBS. Please go ahead. Yes, sure. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding your strategy. After this subsidies declined. Say, how much percentage you could pass this shortfall to your customers or you plan to pass? If the subsidy declined by $100, how many dollars do you expect the customers might pay as an extra to make up this short fall? William, you want to talk about the subsidy effect on our pricing, the forms of subsidy or if you want me to do it? There are two types of - do we need translation, sorry. There are two types of subsidy, one is national subsidy, one is local subsidy. Actually it is not very easy for some users in some cities to get local subsidy already. And as for the subsidy declined or reduction, if the subsidy decline by RMB 1 actually user need to pay for that RMB 1. So there is no plan to adjust our price because of this subsidy reduction, which means that if the national subsidy decreases by RMB 10,000 this year, the users need to pay RMB 10,000 more. And before we receive the official announcement of the subsidy policy this year, actually even if the subsidy policy of this year is released, there is no plan to reduce our price to cover the short fall. To add to that, I think our prices is already for the price and value performance ours is really the best in the market with ES6 and ES8. And that's why I think in my view, that's why Tesla has been aggressively lowering their price, because of their market share losses to NIO. And so, I think there is no reason for us to take down our price. The subsidy will keep our margins in place. And also with the 3% reduction in VAT tax, that should help our gross margin significantly. So I think the government policies are actually quite positive for us. Okay, thank you. Yes, my second question is regarding the ES6 orders. I heard it was 7,300. How does this compare to the ES8 orders at the same stage? Say, at the same time last year, what was the cumulative ES8 orders, can you share with us? Yes. I think ES8 at that point was a little bit better, because it was the first time NIO had all this hype for the whole year and it was a big event. So NIO ES8 orders were about 10,000 at this time. But don't forget ES6 we haven't start - I mean we haven't started the marketing campaign, yet. This is mostly the referrals, word of mouth. So you'll see us in April when the Shanghai Auto Show takes off, as William had mentioned having a lot more marketing on ES6.
In addition, part of the reasons our cost are high for Q4 than Q1 is we are building a lot of ES6s to be available in May for test price. That's one thing we learned about ES8 is that we didn't have enough cars for people to test drive, it is very hard to test drive a car. And now we have NIO houses in 27 cities. So we're going to build - so there will be a cost in Q1 to absorb the cost building a lot of ES6s a lot of test drives.
When people drive our ES8, the majority of them will buy that car, vast majority of them. We did ES6s even better because the lighter sportier version of the ES8 it drives phenomenally. So we believe that once we start allowing test drives the order number will go up quite fast in the May June timeframe. Actually ES6 and ES8 focused on different market and user groups. For ES8, it's tapped into the premium 7-seater SUV segment and in that segment we don't have many competitors. And also ES8 represents the first official debut and product launch of NIO and a lot of users who are not potential 7-seater SUV users bought our cars because they love NIO brand, that's why we receive more orders than ES6 at the early stage of ES8 product launch.
And for ES6 the market situation is different it taps into a bigger market, but at the same time the competition is fiercer. For example we have Q5, GLC, X3 in this market segment and their sales volume every month is over 10,000 units. But we are also very confident with our ES6 performance, user experience, the advantages with the taxes and the innovative services and we believe we can keep this competitive edge in this market segment.
We already expected that the early stage of ES6 order is not as good as ES8. That's why as Louis mentioned, we will be holding large scale test drive campaigns and the marketing campaigns starting from May, and we believe that in this bigger and more competitive market segment ES6 will be very competitive compared with traditional ICE cars. Thank you, William. Next question? Your next question comes from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. I actually have three operation questions. The number one is about the NIO House number I noticed that right now is 27, so we have been guiding is about 70, but end up this year. So I want to know whether you have any change about the plan for NIO House number. That's number one question.
Number two is about the Tesla actually. Now we have localized the Model Y next year. Can I assume the ES6 compete with Model Y, because Model Y has been set at 10% bigger than the Model 3. Since that will compete with Model Y so I want to know whether it will compete with Model Y meanwhile because the Model 3 have a such a big success in the U.S. do we have any plan to introduce a similar model than the Model 3 for NIO in the future say 2021?
And the third question is about the software, one of the key things is about the, so far our ADAS have still not fully been utilized because of the software, you have been guiding software maybe ready in the May year. So can we have update about the software when will it be fully ready to have a much better user experience. And lastly I also have a question about battery, since the ES6 have better battery, can we know when is the battery can be used I mean the same 811 battery can be used to ES8 and when will be used, if at use will the price offer ES8 will be increase or not? Thank you. Thank you, Wang Bin. I'll take one at a time. On NIO Houses, we currently have 13 in 11 cities and 16 pop-up NIO Houses. We wanted a large footprint as we launch ES6 and because of the dispersion of the ES8 orders across the cities. We won't - you won't see us go to 70 cities this year. So, we realized that the expenses are high.
So we are controlling the expenses, so you'll see high expenses in Q1 and then we should see a gradual decline, significant decline and expenses in Q2, Q3, and Q4, as we march toward profitability. So it's number one, we think we have pretty good coverage in the 27 cities we may add a few more, but it won't be a large-scale expansion into 70 cities this year.
Second, Model Y, Model Y was supposed to be some kind of announcement next week. I don't worry about it, because it won't be here for a year or so in China, if even then. It should be 10% bigger than the Model X as what they say, it's closer to ES8. But is a Model X - Model 3, so the Model 3 is 400, the cheapest version RMB 420,000, is 10% more that means the Model Y will be over RMB 500,000 when it comes to China in a year or two. And that will still not be as price competitive with our ES6, which is RMB 358,000.
And that depends on whether you get one motor or two motors in the Model Y. So I think is our ES6 will compete very well, it should be a slightly bigger, it'll be X5 versus X3, which is what I think the Model Y will be comparable to. So I think our car is more than ready to meet the challenges of Model Y, when it comes to China. As far as Model 3 is concerned, we are in discussions about MP2 platform, NIO platform 2. But we haven't decided on what the format of that will be.
So we don't know, if we will - but there's no immediate plans in the next year to have a car that will compete with Model 3 of that size. We think ES6 already competes more than favorably with Model 3. Chinese prefers SUVs to sedan and ours is an SUV, Tesla's is a small sedan. Sedans are not preferred choice.
Second is the model the ES6 is cheaper than the Model 3 and much higher price performance statistics faster, longer range, much more luxurious. Remember the Model 3 is a slim down no - nothing fancy in the interior with not the same service level as ES6. So I think they are different classes and I think the ES6 should be a much more appealing car to Chinese users.
Your question on ADAS software, we - the current timing is for highway pilot or NIO highway pilot to be available sometime in Q2. Don't forget the NIO ES8 are already equipped with the ADAS hardware. So for us once that's available - once we order that package, we will get a high revenue a high gross margin number.
So we'll turn it on, on the software side it will make over RMB 35,000 to RMB 40,000 by doing that. So we expect NIO pilot, the current timetable is next quarter it will be released in available for ES8 and ES6 owners.
On the battery, 84 kilowatt battery is going to be available for both ES8 and ES6. So ES6 for a cheaper version can use the 70 kilowatt battery as well. And then for ES8 owners who have 70 kilowatts, William and NIO is offering a onetime trade-in value where you can get 60% off for an 84 kilowatt battery if you want to buy that. So we are offering it available, it's the same battery pack. So it's swappable.
So for the 70 kilowatt batteries they're from ES8 that are changed. We will use them in our swap network. So they won't go to waste. And so we expect that battery to have - for the ES6 it takes the range to 510 on the 84 kilowatt, for the ES8 it takes the range from 355 to 420. So that will solve the range issues for that many - the biggest complaint from ES8 owners was range. So we expect to have a solution for them by June, July of this year.
Does that answer your questions, Wang Bin? Okay, great. I think it does.
Next question, please. There are no questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to the company to closing remarks. Thank you. Okay. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today.

2019-05-29,29,5,2019,4.0,-0.5006242339947617,0.0,1.0,Earnings Call Transcript Q1-2019,"Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by for NIO Incorporated's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Today's conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jade Wei, Senior Director of Investor Relations of the Company. Please go ahead, Jade. Thank you, Annie. Good evening, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NIO's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The company's financial and operating results were published in the press release earlier today and are posted on the company's IR Web site.
On today's call, we have Mr. William Li, Founder, Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Louis Hsieh, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Nick Wang, our Vice President of FINANCE. Louis is joining us by telephone from the United States.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Hsieh. Louis, please go ahead. Thank you, Jade. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
In the first quarter 2019, NIO delivered 3,989 ES8s, our high-performance premium electric SUV, exceeding the company's prior delivery targets between 3,500 to 3,800. This was followed by 1,124 ES8 deliveries in April, bringing total aggregate deliveries to 16,461 vehicles as of April 30, 2019.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, we experienced softer demand in the first quarter due to accelerated deliveries made at the end of last year in anticipation of electric vehicle subsidy reductions, as well as seasonal factors surrounding the Chinese New Year holidays. Further, we have seen the slowdown in ES8 orders, which became noticeable after Chinese New Year, and has worsened into the current quarter. We anticipate a sequential decrease in deliveries when second quarter closes, primarily due to (1) macro-economic concerns over the lingering US-China trade war, (2) overall continued sluggishness in the Chinese auto market which saw year-to-date wholesale vehicle sales drop 15% year-over-year, and retail vehicle sales drop 12% year-over year, and (3) larger-than-anticipated electric vehicle subsidy cuts, which lower ES8 subsidies by 40% to RMB 40,500 from RMB 67,500 in 2018.
Subsidies will further be reduced to RMB 11,520 beginning June 26, 2019. Additionally, we believe there is some cannibalization of ES8 orders in the current quarter caused by ES6, which became available in NIO Houses this quarter. ES6 is a sportier, less expensive SUV by approximately RMB 90,000. We anticipate this more challenging and uncertain sales environment to dampen sequential demand and reflect continued weakness in ES8 sales in the current quarter.
In light of these challenging sales backdrop and macro-economic environment, the Company has already begun taking steps to control costs and optimize operational efficiencies. Nick will elaborate more later on the call, but some early results of our cost control efforts are already reflected in first quarter numbers.
A quarter-over-quarter 28.8% sequential decrease in R&D spend and a quarter-over-quarter 32.2% sequential decrease in SG&A spend. These initial efforts provide us the runway required to optimize the business sustainably for the long-term. We expect to see more efficiency gains to pick up in the coming quarters. Also, as part of the larger restructuring initiative to optimize operational efficiencies, we made the hard and necessary decision to pare down headcount by 4.5% to 9,390 global employees as of April 30, 2019, from 9,834 at the end of 2018.
And now I'd like to give you an update on our sales expectations for the ES8 and ES6. With 1,124 ES8s delivered in the month of April, total ES8 deliveries for the year 2019 four months, stood at 5,113. Moving to our ES6, our second production model, a five-seater high-performance premium electric SUV, we are excited that as of today, the first ES6 ready to be delivered to our external user is rolled off the production line. In June, as scheduled, more ES6s will be produced and the first deliveries will reach NIO users. The ES6 has received broad-based positive feedback from the media and potential customers ever since the recent Shanghai Auto Show. And the early reviews from our ES6 test drive campaign launched in May bode well for continued positive momentum.
We currently have more than 12,000 ES6 pre-orders as a growing pipeline, among which over 5,000 were added during the past five-and-a-half weeks since the Shanghai Auto Show. When our users had the access to touch and feel the ES6 for the first time, we are confident that as more and more new potential users start to experience the ES6 firsthand, from behind the wheel and on the road, that the vehicle's competitive features and price will translate to increased market demand.
Now, through the lens of optimizing efficiencies, controlling costs and managing cash flow, I would like to provide more specifics on how we are approaching certain business decisions as they relate to our service networks. Starting with our NIO Houses, NIO Houses and NIO Pop-up Houses are important to our direct sales model. We currently have 15 NIO Houses in 12 cities across China. These are complemented by 17 NIO Pop-up Houses in an additional 17 cities.
Going forward, we will shift our focus to smaller NIO Pop-up Houses or similar kinds. NIO Pop-up Houses require less capital and provide greater flexibility on the cost side. We believe that the combined number of NIO Houses and NIO Pop-up Houses across China provide the necessary support and coverage for our sales and market penetration plans and a limited number of new facilities will be added in the near future.
For NIO Service Centers, as of April 2019, we have 14 covering major cities across the country. We had additional 100 Authorized Service Centers nationwide, forming a comprehensive network coverage. Authorized Service Centers, or ASCs, represent cooperation with existing Tier 1 4S dealership partners. We have a dedicated team that selects, trains, and certifies ASCs to be part of our network. To support our sales goals in 2019, we will focus on the asset-light ASCs to extend our service coverage.
Turning to NIO Power, we presently have 125 NIO battery swap stations throughout the country, which we believe will provide sufficient coverage for our users at this stage. By continually analyzing user location data, we can flexibly deploy these resources and adjust locations to more fully optimize the efficiency of this power solution network. With NIO Power Mobile, we currently have around 500 on the road which can easily support both our current users as well as our anticipated future users in 2019.
Currently, around 80% of NIO users have installed home chargers, which remain as the most efficient and cost-effective power solution for both our users and the company. We launched our Fast Charger power station recently at the Shanghai Auto Show and the number of the fast charger is still small. We will only install future fast chargers based on surged demand of our vehicles and service needs.
In April, we opened our one-click power solution network to other electric vehicle brand users in China. With this program, third-party EV owners in China are able to use our NIO Power one-click valet charging services. This will allow for growth of this service, improve the operating efficiency, and expand NIO's brand awareness among the electric vehicle general public.
On a separate note, I would like to give you a brief update on a few of our ongoing initiatives. At the Shanghai Auto Show, the company showcased a preview version of ET7, a high-performance premium electric sedan. Recently, the company made the decision to design and develop ET series with the future NIO platform 2.0 or NP2, a new generation product platform of NIO with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities. We will provide an update on the launch timeline of the ET series in the future. Meanwhile, the company plans to leverage the platform technologies from the ES8 and ES6 to create a new model design more efficiently and expect to launch the third vehicle model in 2020.
We will continue to invest in research and development for our products and technologies, in particularly, NP2. As we do so, we will look to build strategic research alliances with partners in the automotive and technology sectors. We expect such collaborations can continually advance the technologies of our vehicles and platforms through leveraged strength and resources.
Recent developments, firstly, we are very pleased to announce that NIO has entered into a framework agreement with Beijing E-Town International Investment and Development Company, E-Town Capital, an investment corporation headquartered in Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, so-called BDA. Pursuant to this agreement, the company will establish an entity as NIO China in BDA and contribute certain businesses and assets into this Entity. E-Town Capital will initially invest up to RMB 10 billion through its affiliated entities or jointly with third parties in NIO China in exchange for a minority equity stake. Furthermore, it is expected that E-Town Capital will help NIO to build or to find third-party partners to build a new manufacturing facility for our next-generation vehicles of NIO. We will continue working together toward signing a binding definitive agreement for this investment.
Secondly, in April 2018, the Company established a joint venture company, GAC-NIO, together with NIO Capital, Guangqi New Energy Automobile and GAC, to mainly engage in electric vehicle and parts development, sales and services. William Li, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NIO, is serving as the chairman of GAC-NIO. About a week ago, GAC-NIO released its new brand, Hycan He Chuang, and plans to launch the first vehicle model this year. We expect to work strategically with GAC-NIO and leverage each other's strength in technologies, supply chains and service networks.
Third, ES6 manufacturing agreement, in April 2019, we entered into a manufacturing cooperation agreement with JAC for the ES6, which is basically a supplement to our existing manufacturing agreement of the ES8. We will continue paying JAC manufacturing fees on a per-vehicle basis and compensate JAC for its audited operating losses. Please refer to our earnings press release published on our IR website a few hours ago for more details.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our Vice President of Finance, Mr. Nick Wang, to provide the financial details for the quarter. Nick, please go ahead. Thank you, Louis. I will now go over some of our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 1.6 billion, or US$243.1 million, representing a decrease of 52.5% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Our total revenues are made of two parts; vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 1.5 billion, or US$228.8 million, representing a decrease of 54.6% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in vehicle sales over the fourth quarter of 2018 was attributed to accelerated deliveries of the ES8 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in anticipation of EV subsidy reductions in China in 2019, as well as the seasonal slowdowns surrounding the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter of 2019.
Other sales in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 96.0 million, or USD14.3 million, representing an increase of 76.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in other sales over the fourth quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to increased revenues derived from NIO life merchandise and services provided in the first quarter of 2019.
Cost of sales in the first quarter of 2019 was RMB 1.9 billion, or USD275.7 million, representing a decrease of 45.9% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in cost of sales over the fourth quarter of 2018 was mainly driven by the decrease of delivery volume of the ES8 in the quarter.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 was negative 13.4%, compared with positive 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018, mainly driven by the decrease of vehicle margin in the quarter. More specifically, vehicle margin in the first quarter of 2019 was negative 7.2%, compared with positive 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in vehicle margin was mainly driven by the decrease of delivery volume of the ES8 in the quarter.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 1.1 billion, or USD 160.7 million, representing an increase of 55.4% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 28.8% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding non-GAAP share-based compensation expenses, research and development expenses were RMB 1.0 billion, or USD155.9 million, representing an increase of 52.7% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 30.0% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses over the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to the higher design and professional expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 to support the frequent test research and development stage of the ES6, our 5-seater high-performance premium electric SUV launched in December 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 1.3 billion, or USD196.7 million, representing an increase of 71.5% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 32.2% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding non-GAAP share-based compensation expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB 1.2 billion, or USD183.9 million, representing an increase of 67.6% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 32.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses over the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to decreased marketing and promotional activities and decreased expenditures on outsourcing professional services.
Loss from operations in the first quarter of 2019 was RMB 2.6 billion, or USD 390.0 million, representing an increase of 78.8% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 24.1% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP adjusted loss from operations was RMB 2.5 billion, or USD 372.2 million, representing an increase of 75.7% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 24.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018.
Share-based compensation expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were RMB 119.6 million, or USD17.8 million, representing an increase of 184.0% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 15.6% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily attributed to the decrease of share-based compensation expenses related to certain directors and executive officers.
Our net loss was RMB 2.6 billion, or USD390.9 million, in the first quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 71.4% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 25.1% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted non-GAAP net loss was RMB 2.5 billion, or USD 373.1 million, in the first quarter of 2019, representing an increase of 68.2% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 25.5% from the fourth quarter of 2018.
Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the first quarter of 2019 was RMB 2.6 billion, or USD 395.2 million, representing a decrease of 32.8% from the first quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 24.6% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders on a non-GAAP basis was RMB 2.5 billion, or USD 372.7 million.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the first quarter of 2019 were both RMB 2.56, or 38 cents. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB 2.42, or 36 cents. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 7.5 billion, or USD1.1 billion, as of March 31, 2019.
On 1st January 2019, the company adopted ""ASC 842 Leases"" and used the additional transition method to initially apply this new lease standard at the adoption date. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized on the company's consolidated financial statements.
And now for our Business Outlook, for the second quarter of 2019, the Company expects deliveries to be between 2,800 and 3,200 vehicles, representing a decrease of approximately 19.8% to 29.8% from the first quarter of 2019. This outlook incorporates the planned deliveries of several hundred ES6s in June 2019. The company also expects second quarter total revenues to be between RMB 1.1 billion and RMB 1.3 billion, or between US$169 million and US$193 million. This would represent a decrease of approximately 20.7% to 30.5% from the first quarter of 2019.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have three ones. The first one is about ES6 order. Actually you said that in the past 5.5 weeks ago around 5,000 orders. What we call in the conference call in the year 2018 result, you mentioned already have 7,000 orders by around March -- early March, so around 12 months in between, it seems that [indiscernible] not much order received, can you explain why in that [indiscernible] not much order for ES6? That's number one question.
Number two question is about your recent announcement about your NIO China. Can I know what's the specific arrangement assuming under less call will be another joint venture between NIO Inc. and E-Town, and what will be the asset ingestion into this NIO China asset detail, please?
And number three, can you confirm whether your full-year volume guidance changed or not, and remember your full-year year bottom guidance is 40,000 units is more than 20,000 ES6, can you remind us your full-year overall guidance? Thank you. Hey. Wang Bin, this is Louis. I'll take one and three, and I'll let William and Nick answer two. For one, we had about -- we had 7,000 something orders, pre-orders for ES6, but don't forget those orders are refundable. So, during May -- margin, I mean during that month before the Shanghai Auto Show, there wasn't a thousand or so plus, I can't remember the exact number, who also got a refund on their order. So what we're talking about is new orders from April, I guess, 17th or 18th when the Shanghai Auto Show started until yesterday. So, those five weeks, but don't forget there's also cancellations in orders. So it's a moving target. But it's very encouraging to see 5,000 new pre-orders in only 5.5 weeks since ES6 was launched. It has gotten obviously very good accolades and very good reviews from the press and from driving magazines.
On question three, regarding the guidance, we had targeted for the year -- you know I've been telling people recently about 35,000 to 40,000 as of in March or so a few months ago. The slowdown has hit us with the subsidy reduction. Remember, ES8 subsidies went from 67,000 down to under 40,000 and going to 11,000 ES8 soon. And then with the trade war and the softening environment, I think at this time we are not prepared to give any kind of target number for the full-year, what I'd like to do is wait until ES6 is launched and see how that ramps up. So, we'll be in a better position to give full-year sort of targeted numbers -- it's unofficial, but targeted numbers in a couple of months once ES6 is launched. And then William and Nick, you want to take the E-Town question? [Foreign Language] Wang Bin, thank you for your question. So, regarding our recent announcement about our framework agreement with the E-Town International Investment and Development Company, which is E-Town Capital, actually E-Town Capital while being helping us through a third-party partners and also its affiliated entities to inject about RMB 10 billion in exchange for the minority equity stake for the NIO, and at the same time, NIO will be establishing NIO China in the BDA E-Town. So we will be relocating part of our major business to this NIO China, but still our NIO, Inc. will be holding most of its control over the NIO China and also NIO China will be part of our consolidated statements.
So, NIO China will be important channel and a tool for our RMB fundraising, because it's through our public in the NYSE we have a very diverse fundraising channel for the U.S. owners. With the NIO China, we can diversify our fundraising channel for the RMB. With both fundraising channels, I think it will help us to sustain our future development for the second generation platform, and the team is now working with E-Town on the details of these definitive agreements, and there will be a lot of details that need to be refined, and we will keep you guys updated on this news. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lei Wang of CICC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is also about NIO China. So if E-Town becomes a minority shareholder of NIO China decides the term bid in fresh capital, what can NIO expect from E-Town and will NIO still have manufacturing facility in Beijing? So would you prefer they also think or turn to the in-house manufacturing in the future? That's a first question.
The second question is about how to stimulate the sales, if the demand continues to remain weak, do you have any other plans to stimulate the sales is the second question? And the second question is about NIO, [indiscernible] JV in the future generate any cash flow to NIO and what is the synergy between NIO and the JAC NIO? Thank you. Okay. William, you want to take these three questions, after Eve translates? Okay. [Foreign Language]
So, regarding your first question, the framework agreement that we entered with the E-Town Capital is mainly -- has many mentioned that the E-Town Capital will be helping or will be helping us to find the third-party partners to build a manufacturing facilities for the next-generation platform product. But for the near-term, we will be upholding the joint manufacturer model as we are having right now with the JAC, because this manufacturing co-operation has a very high efficiency in terms of the management and investment. Of course, we will not exclude any opportunities that we may be establishing our own manufacturing facilities, but for this RMB 10 billion fundraising or asset raising, it is more of a development research and also the user network requirements.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding your second question about the sales volume of ES6, actually we've kicked of the global media test drive and also the nationwide user test drive and we've getting a lot of feedback, a positive feedback and a review from these people and participants. So for the next following months, we will be taking active market campaigns both online and online, so that more people can appreciate and understand our product. We will organize more test drives for our potential users and we will also seek to expand our sales channels, of course direct selling will still be one of our top priorities, but at the same time, we will try to find opportunities, so that we can present our products from our partner sites and more people will get to know our brand. And for ES6, we believe it is a very powerful and strong product compared with the Q5 from Audi, GLC from Mercedes Benz and X3 from BMW actually ES6 on par with these.
If you look at the sales volume of ES8 for the first four months of 2019, you will find a sales volume ranked the first place among all the seven-seater premium SUV, actually the sales volume of ES8 has surpassed the volume of XC90 for the first four months of this year, and the sales volume of ES8 is a true side the sales of the Model X from Tesla. And for ES6 it will be tapping into a wider market, the 5-seater SUV and in this competition, we believe that the ES6 will be outperforming other products even including the gasoline cars.
[Foreign Language]
As for your third question about the joint venture between GAC and NIO, we just announced the GAC news latest brand that is HYCAN in Hangzhou and they will be launching their product next year. This is a very important long-term strategic partnership for both sides. So we can leverage each other strength in terms of the R&D, supply chain and service network and we can also utilize the synergies and we have confidence with this sustainable and long-term partnership. We may not see an immediate -- we may not see some immediate payback or returns at the short-term, but we believe for the long-term this will be a very good partnership for both sides.
[Foreign Language]
And also for this high com actually the price range of high com will be a bit lower than the price range of new product. So, with this platform or with this joint venture, it doesn't mean that NIO will be selling our product directly with this platform. In fact, we want to leverage its cost efficiency on this highly competitive platform, so that we'll spread it into the wider market. This is another approach for NIO to expand our market presence. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is related to the competitive dynamic for ES8. What is expected with the subsidy ready to come down even further in June that you might have a pre-buy of this product? Maybe if you could just talk about what vehicles the ES8 is competing with, and how it's doing competitively and in terms of market share. The second question is just about if you could help us to understand the cash burn in Q1 if you could give us any detail on what the CapEx was working capital and more importantly what is the outlook for the cash burn in future quarters once the ES6 launches, should we be expecting a significant lower cash burn in the future? Thank you. William, do you want to take the ES8 competitive landscape question; and Nick, you can take the cash burn question for -- in R&D and CapEx spent. William? Okay. [Foreign Language]
Regarding the question about the competitiveness of ES6 -- sorry -- ES8 actually ES6, sorry ES8 not only targets at the premium electric SUV. It also aims at the segments of all the premium six and seven-seater SUV including EV and also the gasoline cars. So our competitors in this segment include [indiscernible] from Volvo and Model X from Tesla. So for the short-term the subsidy reduction may affect our competitiveness a little bit, but we do have other advantages including our high performance, our use of friction, our user network and our users they get to enjoy 10% purchasing tax discount for buying an EV. And they also enjoy the preferential policies for the license plate application and usage in cities like Beijing or Shanghai. So in with other advantages will help us to offset the impact of the subsidy reduction. And we believe that ES8 will strong -- will still be a very strong and powerful product in this segment. Thank you. I think to answer your questions about the cash burn. I think in Q1 we, I won't call it burn, we actually have a cash outflow of over RMB 4 billion, but the special note will be paid because in December we delivered more than 7,000 units but in Q1 when we delivered like roughly a half of it. So there is a huge working capital gap. A lot of the payment occurs in the months of January and February as well. So working capital will take a significant portion of it. And also, if you look at our expenses item like R&D as well as C&A that actually take us some large portion as well. So overall in moving forward we think that this cash burn rate is going to go down quarter by quarter for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's actually with the launch ES6 we're going to bring more volume into the picture. Accordingly and the as a result working capital is going to help our cash flow.
Number two with the launch of our LOP or Lean Operation Program, essentially you can call it internal organizational optimization program. We're going to cut down our cost, cut down unnecessary spending in both strategic spending of RMB by rebalancing our product portfolio and also balancing our self-network spending versus seek some, strategic alliance in the channels, so we can cut down significantly. And also in terms of people's and the daily operation we issued a new policy and put the stringent mindset into people's minds. So and that makes the - makes the lean operation concept not only reflected in the numbers but also reflect in every minds of our employees. Hey Dan, it's Louis. We expect Q2 cash burn to be a little bit high. But then Q3 and Q4 once ES6 starts delivery and we expect the cash burn to come down relatively quickly. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi, William, Louis, Nick, Jade. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on the content and specs of the ES6, are we still on track to install 811 NCM batteries and also will level 2.5 be ready upon the launch and also in light of the current environment, do you see opportunities to reduce component prices from suppliers. And if so where do you see most of that, whether it's a battery motor, inverter or others? Thank you. Thank you, Fei. William, do you want to talk about ES6 specs and current reduction in price possibilities? Yes. [Foreign Language]
About the 811 NCM battery pack, actually it is proceeding as our schedule. So it will be available to our users in July and actually in our validation and it passed, the 811 NCM battery pack showed strong performance. So we're quite confident about it. As for our corporation and partnership with CATL, our battery solid supplier, actually we have a long-term cost reduction framework with CATL. So we will be witnessing significant cost reduction in terms of the battery pack from the third and the fourth quarter of this year. Based on our volume assumption, in this framework, you will witness this cost reduction by this one. Thank you. Thank you. That's very helpful. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line… Dan, it's Louis. Sorry. It's Louis Hsieh. Some of the specs just for your -- what you asked about the ES6 is very competitive with the likes of Mercedes EQC I-Pace Model 3 and Model X and Model S from Tesla. So it's very fast zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds. It has a longer range 500 plus kilometers with an 84 kilowatt battery. And so its performance, its communication, it's service everything should be very competitive if not better and its price below all those models including the Model 3. So we think it's a very price competitive car. It looks sporty, it's sharp and it is full of amenities. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Yen Min [ph] of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hi, [indiscernible]. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two quick questions here. My first question is on the future new products. As Louis has just mentioned, it seems like we will be launching another model in 2020 before the ET series. Just could you please share with us your source behind this decision and also would this be another SUV model and what sort of market seminar are we targeting at. And my second question is as mentioned just now that the demand was negatively impacted by the annually subsidy cuts. So wondering if there's any chance of -- if there's any chance that you would be adding lower price streams for the ES6 and ES8 models to drive the demand? Thank you. William, you want to answer these two? Okay. [Foreign Language]
So about the ET7 and also our new product, we launched our ET preview during Shanghai Auto Show this year and we have received a lot of positive feedback and review about this ET preview, but actually earlier this year, we decided that we would like to launch our ET7, our second generation platform NP2 because the -- recently, we decided to launch this ET7 on our second generation platform, NP2 because the next several years will be very important for the transformation of ADUS, AD and the smartness technologies. So you will be seeing the transformation for the sensors, for the computing unit and also for the E architecture of the vehicle and we want to see this ongoing transformation that's why we decided to put the ET7 on the second generation platform.
So, in terms of the launching time of ET7, it is postponed a little bit. I think this is also the best decision - it is postponed for the next generation. I believe this is a positive decision for the company, for our investors as well as our users, but at the same time, we understand that the market is expecting a new product or a new model from NIO. So earlier this year, we decided that we - on top of the current generation platform, we would like to leverage our existing technologies to launch a new model next year and right - at the moment, we may not share sufficient information with you, but you understand that NIO can be quite efficient and agile in terms of our [indiscernible] development. So you can expect the launch of this new model next year.
[Foreign Language]
As for the demand after the subsidy cuts, actually for our ES6 and ES8, we target at the premium SUV segment for both electric cars and also the combustion car. For ES6 and ES8 their competitors including a lot of premium SUVs from luxury brands, and even with this competition we still believe that we have a strong competitiveness. We have the tax discount with purchasing tax, consumption tax and also duty. We also have a strong performance. We have good user services. We also have the preferential policies for the licensed plate, application and usage. So we believe that maybe in the short-term, the subsidy cost may affect us a little bit, but in the long run we do have the strong market performance in this segment. And as more and more people starting appreciate - start appreciating and adopting EVs, we believe in the long run ES6 and ES8 will be very powerful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Gong of UBS. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you. I have two questions. The first one is regarding this deal subsidiary, NIO China, since E-Town, wherein E-Town has committed RMB 10 billion just for minority interest in this NIO entity. Does that mean, NIO Incorporation is also committed for more than RMB 10 billion investment into this NIO China entity? If so, is this a NIO investment into the NIO China in the form of cash or in the form of technology or whatever, or maybe I think, can you give us a little bit color on this? This is my first question. My second question is, I noticed on the balance sheet, there is some item within the equity got additional paid in capital that has declined from RMB 41.9 billion to RMB 40 billion, declined by RMB 1.9 billion during this quarter. Can you please give us a little bit color, what was the reason for that? Thank you. William, you want to talk about E-Town, NIO China? Okay. [Foreign Language]
Regarding this NIO China with E-Town, actually it doesn't mean that we will be investing more than RMB 10 billion into this NIO China in exchange for more equity stocks. Is that easier to cut our NIO Inc. current business, actually most of our business including our employee, including ours sales network are based in China. Over 90% of our employees are based in China. So for this asset, for this existing asset we already have a high end goods evaluation. So this is how we work with this NIO China, we'll be leveraging this existing asset and the business for the equity fundraising. Thank you. So, could you factor them more briefly to understanding it in the way you give some minority shares at your Beijing E-Town and they paid in RMB 10 billion as an investment into this entity, so it's kind of in the form of portfolio finance through equity? Yes. That's correct. That's actually from E-Town and it's affiliated. Yes. Okay. I'm going to address your second question, Paul. Essentially this reduction on the equity portion RMB 1.9 billion reflected and it was strictly related to the convertible bond that we issued back in around the end of January, early February. So in this bond I can explain a little bit more detail. There is a two derivative product; one is called a prepaid -- prepaid forward. The other one is called additional call option. If you understand the fundamental structure, initial structure of a convertible bond, it's actually a face value plus 30%, 30% the price over the stock price at the time of issuance. So, on top of it, we actually put additional call option which raised the stock price to call, the strike price from 30% to 100%, because that's take roughly $80 million. The other one is the prepaid forward capital. Essentially, we use the part of the proceeds from this debt issuance to buy back some of the stock and to sweeten the deal essentially. So make this transaction completely completed. So overall, this has actually resulted in the reduction in our equity positions of RMB 1.9 billion as you compare in our balance sheet. Thank you, Paul. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. As there are no further questions, now I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Thank you, and see you next quarter. Thank you everyone. Thank you. This concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Hsieh, for opening remarks. Louis, please. Thank you, Jade. And good morning, and good evening everyone. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to explain our decision to cancel the original call scheduled on September 24th and why we are having this call now.
We have made significant positive progress in NIO's China funding projects with certain parties. As you can imagine, we are in a very sensitive period during which we are not at liberty to disclose the confidential information related to those projects, which led us to initial decision to cancel the original call on September 24th.
Further, we believed the Q2 earnings release distributed yesterday provided a good update on the company’s operations and financial performance. This is a very fast moving and fluid situation with many advisors helping to navigate this period of time and it has not been easy to find a path that is best for everyone. However, after receiving numerous investors' inquiries since the original call cancellation, we ultimately decided that resuming our original plan to hold the call provides more transparency and serves the interest of our investing community better.
As it relates to the call, please understand that we will not be able to disclose any specific information or answer any questions regarding the NIO China funding projects today. We will disclose further information when the projects reach a stage that would subject us to a disclosure obligation.
With this, I will turn the call over to William Li for our business highlights. William? Thank you, Louis. Thanks to everyone for joining our call today. I will speak mainly in Chinese and Ms. Eve Tang will interpret for me.

In the second quarter of 2019, NIO delivered 3,553 vehicles, including 3,140 ES8s[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 11:38:00 2019
], our 6 and 7-seaters high-performance electric flagship SUV and 413 ES6s, our 5-seater high-performance premium smart electric SUV, which commenced user deliveries in late June.
In the third quarter, we expected[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 11:41:00 2019
] to deliver between 4,200 and 4,400 vehicles and bring our cumulative deliveries of ES8 and ES6 to over 23,000 by the end of September to users in over 270 cities throughout China. As of today, our ES8 and ES6 users have driven more than 250 million kilometers. And to support our users on the road, NIO Power has completed more than 200,000 charges through our one-click-for-power services.
[Foreign Language]
We achieved our second quarter delivery results against to the backdrop of four factors; first, continued overall weakness in the Chinese auto market, which saw a 14.3% drop in passenger vehicle wholesale sales from a year earlier; second, fierce competitive discounting among premium auto brands, with data showing that average selling price in this segment has dropped to 20% to 25% compared to its peak levels; third, electric vehicle subsidy reductions starting from late March, and again in late June, which affected demand for electric vehicles; and lastly, slowing consumer discretionary spending as a result of macro-economic uncertainties surrounding U.S.-China trade tension.
[Foreign Language]
Despite the overall environment, for the first eight months of 2019, sales of our ES8 ranked first in China’s premium electric SUV market. ES8 was the only electric vehicle among the [Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 11:47:00 2019

We started deliveries of our ES6 in late June. Since then, we have received broad-based, positive reviews on the ES6 from both media and our users, particularly for its outstanding driving experience, extended driving range and competitive design features. We have seen growth of our order backlog accelerating in the last four weeks as we started to roll out a more expanded sales network, a[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 11:48:00 2019

In addition, starting in October, we will begin delivering the ES6 and ES8 with an 84-kilowatts per hour battery pack, extending their NEDC driving range to 510 kilometers and 430 kilometers, respectively. Going forward, we will continue to enhance product competitiveness and strengthen sales by further advancing our software and autonomous driving technology.

In response to these challenging market conditions, we are aggressively expanding our sales efforts to accelerate orders, taking comprehensive measures to reduce our costs across the organization and improve overall operational efficiency of the Company. Louis will share more details on these initiatives later in the call.
Louis, please go ahead. Thank you, William. Facing the challenges in China’s auto industry, we are focusing our sales initiatives in three areas: creating retail points of sales, called NIO Spaces, strengthening regionally driven promotions and implementing commercial leasing options for corporate users and fleet operators.
First, NIO Space. We are expanding our sales network through NIO-branded sales zones, called NIO Spaces. NIO Spaces, which are normally less than 200 square meters, will allow us to quickly, cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sale points in the market. They will be primarily located in shopping centers and malls, communities with high traffic-flow. The majority of the NIO Spaces will be invested by our selected partners.
By the end of 2019, we aim to have established around 200 NIO Spaces in over 100 cities across China. These will vastly expand our sales footprint throughout China where more potential users can see, touch, feel and drive, and truly enjoy the exhilarating ES6 and ES8 driving experiences.
Second, we are significantly strengthening our sales approaches by encouraging more regionally driven promotions. In September, we introduced the free battery swapping policy and it is attracting a large group of potential users to the cities with existing swapping stations. In Beijing, ICE vehicle users have opportunities to buy an ES8 or ES6 with extra incentives. In addition, we offer more than eight different auto financing programs with seven banks to our users, which significantly diversifies the solutions available to meet different users’ cash needs.
With these actions being implemented, we have seen order growth accelerating significantly since September -- beginning in September. We are also driving sales through selling cars to corporate users and fleet operators. Moreover, we've also introduced the membership subscription program, in which users have opportunities to rent and drive our products for one month or more, to fully experience the product and services.
In addition to these sales initiatives, we are implementing comprehensive cost control measures across the organization. These measures primarily focus on increasing efficiencies and streamlining operations within our sales and service network and our R&D functions, as well as reducing our headcount,[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 12:58:00 2019

]f[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 12:58:00 2019
]irst, our sales and service networks. As mentioned previously we are expanding our offices' sales network by adding NIO Spaces. NIO Spaces are a cost-effective way to implement significantly enlarge our footprint in the market and much less capital intensive compared to our flagship NIO Houses.
Turning to R&D. We remain committed to advanced driving technologies and the development of our second generation platform, NP 2. In the future, our R&D investments will focus on mass-production applications, and we will actively seek strategic partnership opportunities in advanced technology development as a means to prudently manage our spending in this category. We will also be reducing costs by further optimizing the size of the workforce. After extensive internal reviews, we have determined that our headcount can be further reduced. We target to reduce our headcount to around 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from over 9,900 in January 2019 and we expect further headcount reductions by the end of this year, through both restructuring and spinning-off some business units.
With this, I will now turn the call over to our Vice President of Finance, Nick Wang, to provide the financial details for this quarter. Nick, please go ahead. Thank you, Louis. I will now go over some of our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB1.5 billion, or $219.7 million, representing a decrease of 7.5% from the first quarter of 2019. Our total revenues are made of two parts; vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB1.4 billion, or $206.1 million, representing a decrease of 7.9% [[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 13:03:00 2019
]from][Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 13:03:00 2019
] first quarter of 2019, mainly due to the decrease in sales volume caused by the electric vehicle subsidy reduction announced in late March, and the slowdown of macro-economics in China, which has been exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war.
Other sales in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB94 million, or $13.7 million, representing a decrease of 2% from the first quarter of 2019, mainly attributed to the sales decline in charging piles, which was in line with decline in vehicle sales. Cost of sales in the second quarter of 2019 was RMB2 billion, or $293.2 million, representing an increase of 8.8% from the first quarter of 2019, mainly caused by accrued recall costs in relation to the company’s voluntary recall of 4,803 vehicles announced on June 27, 2019.
Total recall costs accrued in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB339.1 million, or $49.4 million, including RMB283.3 million, or $41.3 million recorded in cost of vehicle sales and RMB55.8 million, or $8.1 million, recorded in cost of other sales, respectively. Excluding the accrued recall costs, cost of sales in the second quarter was RMB1.7 billion, or $243.8 million, representing a decrease of 9.6% from the first quarter of 2019.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2019 was negative 33.4%,[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 13:17:00 2019
] compared with negative 13.4% in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding accrued recall costs, gross margin in the second quarter was negative 10.9%. More specifically, vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2019 was negative 24.1%, decreased from negative 7.2% in the first quarter of 2019, mainly driven by the accrued recall costs. Excluding accrued recall costs, vehicle margin in the second quarter was negative 4%.
Research and development expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB1.3 billion, or $189.4 million, increasing 20.6% sequentially, primarily attributed to an increase in rigorous testing activities of the ES6 before its mass production in second quarter of 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were RMB1.4 billion, or $207 million, increasing 7.7% sequentially, primarily driven by the company's marketing expenditures on the Shanghai Auto Show and ES6 test drive campaign in the second quarter.
Loss from operations in the second quarter of 2019 was RMB3.2 billion, or $469.9 million, increasing 23.2% sequentially. Excluding accrued recall costs and expenses, loss from operations in the second quarter was RMB2.9 billion, or $418 million.
Our net loss was RMB3.3 billion, or $478.6 million, in the second quarter of 2019, increasing 25.2% from the first quarter of 2019. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the second quarter, were both RMB3.23, or $0.47. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB3.5 billion, or $503.4 million, as of June 30, 2019.
And now for our business outlook,[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 13:20:00 2019
];[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 13:20:00 2019
] for the third quarter of 2019, the company expects deliveries of vehicles to be between 4,200 and 4,400 units, representing an increase of approximately 18.2% to 23.8% from the second quarter of 2019; total revenues to be between RMB1,593 million or $232 million and RMB1.663 billion or $242.2 million, representing an increase of approximately 5.6% to 10.3% from the second quarter of 2019.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Please. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Feng Wei from CICC. Please go ahead.

] of ES8 and ES6. We have observed very strong momentum of ES6, but ES8 sales declined after recall. Would you please share your thoughts about the sales outlook of ES8 and ES6? Thanks. Thank you, Feng. I think on the first question, we’re not going to take that question for now, because it relates to the China financing projects. You do know that from the release that we do at $200 million convertible bond deal, so that one is the one that has already been disclosed. Regarding to the ES8, ES6 orders, William, do you want to address that question please? Okay. [Foreign Language]
Thanks for your questions. The sales of ES8 in July and August is quite challenging. That's the fact and previously the same challenge faced by other EV companies, because with the subsidy reduction starting from the 20th of June, we can see the surge up in retail has perhaps declined and this is a challenge for the whole industry.
[Foreign Language]
As you can see in July and August, we didn't take any initiative to provide rebates or[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 14:55:00 2019

But just now, I had mentioned that the price of those premium EVs in the market, the premium cars in the market actually has reduce so this means it will affect the sales of our cars in the July and August time.
[Foreign Language]
We are quite confident about the competitiveness of the ES8 product and the service. As you can see in September, the rates and the sales of ES8 are picking up in the market and in October, we're going to deliver the 84 kilowatt hour battery version ES8. We believe this can actually help us to extend the drive range of ES8, which has been an [Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:00:00 2019

[Foreign Language]
From January to August, the sales of our ES8 ranked as the top three for the 7-seater and 6-seater SUV market segment. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]

]bureau. But you need to understand, our relationship with the battery supply chain partner is a long-term one. We have agreed on how we are going to cover the cost of the battery recall. But the battery recall is a very significant cost, because it will cover the new battery pack production, logistics and execution. We believe the share of the responsibility is actually quite reasonable and the cost segmentation is also quite reasonable. But the responsibility is quite clear regarding the battery recall issues. This is Nick. I'm happy to answer the second, the question about margins. I'm going to speak only in English for the sake of audience. Actually in Q2, you're right Wang Bin[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:54:00 2019

]. We accrued our portion, our portion of the battery recall related costs at a roughly RMB283 million in the cost of vehicle sales. If you exclude accrued battery recall costs, the company's overall gross margin was around negative 11% in Q2. But out of that the [Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:56:00 2019
]actually[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:55:00 2019
] vehicle margin, vehicle sales margin is negative 4%, so better, okay? Those margins were better than Q1 margins essentially.
But we also expect we're going to deliver more vehicles in the second half of 2019, which I believe will certainly help the gross margin from the scale [Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:57:00 2019
][[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:56:00 2019
]indiscernible] [Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 15:55:00 2019
]economy, especially production related. However, we also expect some mix margin trend coming from the model mix and options. That's the -- you can call it the controllable element but market driven. With that, the gross margin will highly depend on the volume of the deliveries and unit price, including the options of each vehicle we sell. So with our best estimation so far, the gross margin will still be negative for the rest of the year, I think, conservatively speaking. So that's my answer for this margin related part. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. The first one relates to gross margin in the context of a softer volume environment. So backing out the higher warranty costs in 2Q, with the underlying margin of negative 4% or so, have been roughly in-line with your expectations. And how should investors expect vehicle gross margin to trend going forward given this backdrop of lower industry and NIO volumes? Nick, you want to take that? I think, yes. You're absolutely right, Q2, the vehicle gross margins, negative 4%. Again, like I said, the second half, we're probably still going to see a pretty tough market. But we also see potential uptake in our volumes, I think. So overall, the current estimation range for the vehicle margin in Q3 is going to be around, I will say, vehicle margin -- I mean around negative 6%. And Q4 is between negative 6% to negative 10%, conservatively speaking. Okay, great. Thank you. And my second question just relates… We're going to start delivering the base model of the ES6 at the end of this month, so probably next week. So the ES6 based model will have a lower margin if it doesn't have all the options. It'll be counter-weighted somewhat by the 84 kilowatt battery versions that will start shipping next month for Q4, which will have a higher gross margin. And then as Nick said earlier, it depends on the uptake of the volume -- of the options, the options are very high margins. But volume will also -- would definitely help the vehicle gross margins. That's very helpful, thank you. Just my last question is on the distribution strategy. If deliveries remain fewer than anticipated for longer, could that cause you to consider potential adjustments to distribution strategy, particularly with regards to the presumably largely fixed cost NIO houses? Can you talk about the relative cost and capabilities of the NIO Space compared to a NIO House? Well, the NIO Space sometimes are pre[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:02:00 2019
]paid by partners and also the cost will be less than RMB1 million if we had to do it all ourselves on average. So it's very economical. It's also in high traffic area. So that's the direction we're going. The larger NIO Houses, we're done initially to help the company build a brand and to get users into the NIO brand and NIO user experience. But those have three to five year lease terms. So they will -- going forward, you'll see our strategy would be to build more smaller NIO Spaces type operations. And if we do renew NIO Houses, they won't be as big and as luxurious as the ones that are in the original ones in Beijing and Shanghai and other large cities. [Foreign Language]

]effective way for us to increase our reach throughout China’s large cities. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Dan Galves from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I think as a result of the market conditions and kind of the things -- the way things have played out this year, it seems like you have a lot of plans of changes to the business. I was wondering and probably thinking about the business at lower volumes longer term. I was wondering if there was any way, you could roughly talk to us about, given kind of changes to cost structure that you’re planning, and changes to distribution strategy. Is there a volume level that you believe that you can breakeven at in the future, and how much capital do you think that you need to kind of [Technical Difficulty] have a reasonable balance sheet? Yes, I mean that’s a great question. I think, we don’t have enough data. We just started rolling out the NIO Spaces. And as you know, on the volume side, at the beginning of this year when we did forecast for this year, we didn’t expect the -- China's auto market never shrunk as far as I know, and then it shrunk 14 months in a row. So we want to see how -- and you also know we just released a new car ES6. So we would like to see how the momentum and the market sales pick up.
We will do our budgeting at the end of this year. By then, we’ll have three or four months with a dozens of NIO Spaces, to see how the economics work versus the additional model. And I think is that you’re going to see us cut costs significantly Dan[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:18:00 2019
]there[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:18:00 2019
]. So you will see a much leaner operation from NIO. And so I think is the volumes won’t be the 120,000,[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:19:00 2019
] to[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:19:00 2019
] 150,000 that we had talked about actually with these big NIO houses.
And the other thing is we are -- we have R&D initiatives in place to reduce our battery pack cost significantly, which will come out next year as well. So those will all be calculated together as we do budgets and as we get more tracker[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:21:00 2019
]tion[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:21:00 2019
]. It's a little bit too early. I'm not trying to avoid your question. But we don't have the strategic budget for next year yet, given all these -- the turmoil and all the changes in the markets this year. So give us about -- give us until the end of the year. Thanks Louis. That's fair. And just the[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:23:00 2019

] follow up, if I could is, the cash burn. I was wondering if you could talk to us about kind of the level of pre-launch cost for ES6 in terms of marketing and engineering that may go away in Q3. But on the other side it seems like most of the cash costs for the recall happens in Q3. So I mean maybe just talk to us about, is there a potential to meaningfully reduce the cash burn that you saw in Q2, in Q3 and Q4? The answer is yes. If we cannot[Author ID1: at Thu Sep 26 16:25:00 2019

Thank you for standing by for NIO Incorporated’s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Today’s conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jade Wei, Associate Vice President of Investor Relations of the company. Please go ahead, Jade. Thank you, Edison. Good evening and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NIO’s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The company’s financial and operating results were published in the press release earlier today and are posted on the company’s IR website.
On today’s call, we have Mr. William Li, founder, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer; Mr. Steven Feng, Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Stanley Qu, VP of Finance.
Before we continue, please kindly be reminded that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. As such, the company’s actual results may be materially different from the views expressed today.
Further information regarding risks and uncertainties is included in certain filings of the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required under applicable law.
Please also note that NIO’s earnings press release and this conference call include discussions of unaudited GAAP financial information, as well as unaudited non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to NIO’s press release, which contains a reconciliation of the unaudited non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, William. William, please go ahead. [Foreign Language] [Interpreted] Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In the third quarter 2019, we delivered a total of 4,799 ES8 and ES6 vehicles, increasing 35% from the second quarter and exceeding the top-end of our guidance range by 9%. We delivered 5,054 vehicles in October and November. We estimate that the total delivery of Q4 will reach over 8,000.
The auto industry is still experiencing substantial softness and the EV sector, particularly dropped over 35% year-on-year in sales in the second-half of 2019 after the EV subsidies were reduced significantly.
Nevertheless, our order backlog growth has accelerated since September and this strength in order flow continued in the fourth quarter. The growth has been underpinned by three key factors: strong competitiveness of our ES6, in its quality, performance and pricing; strong support from our user community; and our sales network expansion through the efficient NIO Spaces. I will discuss these three factors separately next.
In August, NIO ranked the highest in new vehicle quality among all brands in JD Power’s 2019 New Energy Vehicle Experience Index Study. In December, our ES6 was selected by the most respected industry experts in the Chinese automotive industry to receive the Xuanyuan Award as Car of the Year for its achievements in innovation, mobility and industry contribution, which demonstrates the strong recognition of our brand, quality and performance by users and industry.
We would not have achieved our strong sales results without the support from our passionate user community. Our vision has always been to shape a joyful lifestyle by offering premium smart electric vehicles with the best user experience. Since inception, we have been working diligently to build a vibrant user enterprise.
NIO’s user community is thriving and growing. We now have users in 296 cities across China and 45% of new orders in 2019 were referred by existing users. It has become one – more than just a part of our unique brand identification, but is emerging as an instrumental part of NIO’s development.
Actually, the vibrancy and support of our user enterprise has been remarkable and reaches far beyond word-of-mouth referrals. As an example, in the recent months, acting on their own accord, our users have launched promotional campaigns around China in support of NIO.
In 2019, more than 1,300 user volunteers have dedicated their time voluntarily in NIO House, NIO Space, auto show and event, to sharing their firsthand experience to make more people understand NIO.
In terms of sales network expansion, by the end of this year, we will open 48 NIO Spaces and 22 NIO Houses in 52 cities. Through NIO Spaces, we are able to cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sales point in the market, which in turn helps drive new orders. This important initiative allows more potential users to see, touch, and feel our vehicles, and truly enjoy the superior driving experience our ES8 and ES6 offer.
Most importantly, potential users can compare firsthand the performance and smart features of our vehicles with those of NIO’s competitive models. The favorable comparison result often leads to a NIO purchase, and this has been a contributing force to the sales gains in recent months. We will continue strengthening our sales network through adding more NIO Spaces to expand our coverage and improving the efficiency of NIO Spaces with more data and experience gained through our operations.
On December 28, we held the third NIO Day under the theme Believe in Better in Shenzhen. Over 7,300 NIO users and guests attended. Also, tens of millions of people participated through 55 parallel sessions or online broadcast. NIO users were deeply involved in the planning, directing and execution of NIO Day 2019, showing passion and rally power that echoed with NIO’s vision to be a user enterprise.
During the NIO Day, we also announced 100 kilowatt hour battery pack and 20 kilowatt DC Power Home. All NIO models can upgrade to 100 kilowatt hour battery pack, which will significantly increase the range performance of our product line. Since the launch of the 70 kilowatt hour battery pack in 2018 of the same size, our battery capacity has increased by 40%.
NIO makes continuous investment on power swap technology and owns more than 1,200 patents on the vehicle, battery pack, power swap and cloud. The power swap technology enables users to continuously upgrade the battery and empowers NIO to truly offer Battery as a Service. As the time goes on, more and more people will recognize the advantages of NIO’s unique and competitive power swap system.
Additionally, we unveiled NIO’s third production model, the EC6, a smart premium electric coupe SUV, which has a very sporty look and feel for young and trendy SUV fans. It goes from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in just 4.7 seconds and enjoys an NEDC range of up to 615 kilometers. We have also launched the all-new ES8. It boasts up to 188 improvements, 4.9 seconds 0 to 100 kilometer per hour acceleration, and significantly improved the NEDC range to up to 580 kilometers. We believe the all-new ES8 will have much stronger competitiveness in the market.
NIO Pilot, NIO’s advanced driver-assistance system becomes full-fledged. More than 20 features are now available on NIO Pilot, including traffic jam pilot and highway pilot. It offers a more relaxing and safer driving experience. To date, about half of our users have activated NIO Pilot.
On November 4, we announced our strategic cooperation with Mobileye to develop level 4 autonomous driving vehicles. Teams from both sides have already started working together to explore the best pathways to leverage our respective strengths to develop the future products together.
I would like to now give you an update on our cost control measures. During the third quarter, we continued to implement comprehensive cost control measures across the organization to improve operational efficiency. At the end of December, our global headcount will be less than 7,500.
As a result of our cost reduction measures, our third quarter SG&A decreased 18.1% compared with the second quarter, even as our sales team is now driving and realizing higher levels of sales. Additionally, our R&D expenses decreased 21.3%. Lean operations will continue to be our focus.
Finally, I’d like to warmly welcome Mr. Steven Feng as our new Chief Financial Officer, effective November 18, 2019. We look forward to working with Steven and anticipate that his strong financial and operational experience, impressive track record in equity research and rich automotive background will create greater value for the company and our shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over some of our financial results for Q3 2019. To be mindful of the length of this call, I will address financial highlights here and encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in Q3 2019 were RMB1.8 billion, representing an increase of 21.8% from Q2 2019. Our total revenues are made of two parts; vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in this quarter were RMB1.7 billion, representing an increase of 22.5% from Q2 2019. The increase in vehicle sales over last quarter was mainly due to the increase in ES6 sales volume, resulting from the expansion of our sales network, as we continued adding NIO Spaces and the increased referral rate by our existing users.
Other sales in this quarter were RMB103.4 million, representing an increase of 9.9% from last quarter. The increase in other sales was mainly attributed to the sales increase in charging piles, which was in line with improvement of vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in this quarter was RMB2.1 billion, representing an increase of 2.3% from last quarter. The increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the increase of sales and offset by the inclusion in Q2 accrued recall costs in relation to the company’s voluntary recall of 4,803 new vehicles announced on June 27, 2019.
Gross margin in this quarter was negative 12.1%, compared with negative 33.4% in last quarter. More specifically, vehicle margin in this quarter was negative 6.8%, compared with negative 24.1% in last quarter. The improved vehicle margin was mainly due to the recall costs in last quarter as mentioned.
R&D expenses in this quarter were RMB1.0 billion, representing a decrease of 21.3% from last quarter and relatively unchanged compared with Q3 2018. Excluding non-GAAP share-based compensation expenses, R&D expenses were RMB1.0 billion, representing a decrease of 21.7% from Q2 2019 and an increase of 5.9% from Q3 2018. The decrease in R&D expenses over last quarter was primarily attributed to less testing expenses incurred in the third quarter after ES6’s initial launch in June.
SG&A expenses in this quarter were RMB1.2 billion, representing a decrease of 18.1% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 30.3% from Q3 2018. Excluding non-GAAP share-based compensation expenses, SG&A expenses were RMB1.1 billion, representing a decrease of 17.4% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 15.6% from Q3 2018. The decrease in SG&A expenses over last quarter was primarily driven by the company’s overall cost-saving measures in marketing and other supporting functions.
Loss from operations in this quarter was RMB2.4 billion, representing a decrease of 25.3% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 14.3% from Q3 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP adjusted loss from operations was RMB2.3 billion, representing a decrease of 25.4% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 1.6% from Q3 2018.
Share-based compensation expenses in this quarter were RMB70.4 million, representing a decrease of 23.6% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 83.7% from Q3 2018. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over last quarter was primarily due to the part of the share-based compensation expenses that are recognized using the accelerated method.
Our net loss was RMB2.5 billion in Q3 2019, representing a decrease of 23.3% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 10.3% from Q3 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, adjusted non-GAAP net loss was RMB2.5 billion in Q3 2019, representing a decrease of 23.2% from Q2 2019 and an increase of 3.1% from Q3 2018.
Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders in Q3 2019 was RMB2.6 billion, representing a decrease of 22.9% from Q2 2019 and a decrease of 73.8% from Q3 2018. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, adjusted net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders on a non-GAAP basis was RMB2.5 billion.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in Q3 2019 were both RMB2.48, or $0.35. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB2.38, or $0.33.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB2.0 billion as of September 30, 2019.
And now for our business outlook. As William mentioned, for the fourth quarter of 2019, the company expects deliveries to be over 8,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 67% from Q3 2019. The company also expects fourth quarter total revenues to be approximately RMB2.80 billion. This would represent an increase of approximately 53% from Q3 2019.
Before we start the Q&A session, we would like to give you an update of our financing projects. We have made significant positive progress in these financing projects. However, the projects are still ongoing and we are not at liberty to disclose any confidential information at this point.
Therefore, during today’s call, please understand that we will not be able to disclose any specific information or answer any questions regarding the financing projects. We will disclose further information when the projects reach a stage that would subject us to a disclosure obligation.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. For the benefit of all participants on today’s call, please limit yourself to two questions, and if you have additional questions, please reenter the queue. Your first question is from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] The first question is about CB issuing? What’s the progress about CB? And do net many go through the number three quarter results, or it’s not? Just go to the number four quarter if it has been completely finished?
[Foreign Language] My second question is about sustainability, about SG&A and R&D cost going forward? Okay, thank you. First, I will start with the CB question. As everyone knows, Tencent and William has signed contract with NIO to – for US$200 million on CB. In third quarter, Tencent’s CB has already been closed, so the US100 million from Tencent is already in our Q3 report. And also US$90.5 million were received from William, the rest, US$90.5 million are being processed and the transactions will close soon. Perhaps, as a reminder, the key CB terms, investor could find them with an announcement on September 5th.
Let me move on to the second question of Wang Bin’s about the sustainability and our cost controlling efforts. Yes, you are right. We have done a lot of efforts to – for cost savings. We are in the process of analyzing our 2020 budget. We expect the R&D efficiency to significantly improve, and the R&D expenses to be further reduced in 2020. We will share more information in our Q4 earnings call. [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] [Interpreted] So in terms of the headcount, starting from this year, we have already initiated many operation measures to make sure we can improve the efficiency. We did some layoffs and restructuring of our organization. At the beginning of this year, we had around 9,900 people.
But by the end of this year, we believe we can control the headcount within 7,500. Some of them are now in the legal process. But we believe that by the end of this year, this number should be lower than the 7,500. We think that this is going to be very beneficial for our P&L for the next year. And at the beginning, I have mentioned the lean operation is our focus and this will continue to build a focus in the future.
I think it’s not just about the headcount control, it should be more about how we can optimize and improve the overall cost and expenses efficiency. So this can help us to improve the overall organization efficiency.
Thank you, Wang Bin. Your next question is from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking time to host a call. Just a quick question from my side. The first question is about the sales for next year? I know the third quarter is out, but now we are at the end of 2019. So I just want to get your thoughts about the volumes use for next, because our ES6 just registered solid sales since early this year because of the competitive spec and successful China strategy. But for next year, what will drive the freedom of other upside, because I think the competition in the market was getting more intensive. And in the meantime, I think we’re going to launch EC9 – EC6. I think the model electric coupe, in general, will be smaller than that of four-door SUV, and our ES8, despite the recent upgrade, I think the market is relatively niche.
My second question is about the channel strategy, because you just shared our evolving target for NIO Store and NIO Space by end of this year. So if there is any target for our channels, the expansion for 2020? And what would be more reasonable headcount to support a kind of a sales network?
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] [Interpreted] I would like to take your questions. Starting from September, although the market is still quite challenging and soft, but our order backlog for the ES8 and ES6 has been ramping up. In the past two months, the production orders every day can reach over 100, and this trend has been increasing. If you read the news, you can see that we have already sold all the show cars. So we believe this momentum is going to continue in the future.
Overall speaking, we believe our product positioning is quite right, although the market is quite dynamic. In the past quarter, we have seen some competitive models, for example, Audi E-tron, Mercedes EQC. They have released their price and they started to sell cars in the China markets. But after the users compare our products together with their products, normally, they will buy our products because our product is more competitive compared with those models.
Especially in our specific market segment, that is around RMB300,000 to RMB400,000, that is the segment for the ES6 and ES8. We believe in this midsized premium SUV market, we are quite competitive, because we are ranking at the top 10. This is including the ICE and EV. And we believe in the future, the users will think our ES6 and ES8 are the right choices, if they want to buy a car pricing around RMB300,000 to RMB400,000 range.
With our power swap technologies and our superior services, and we can win the word-of-mouth in the market, and the order situation is actually much better than our expectations. We think that these great sales result is because of our product competitiveness and our great service. This can help us to win the reputation in the market.
For the next year or so, we are quite confident about ES6. For example, in Beijing and Shanghai, if you want to buy a car that is midsized SUV around RMB300,000 to RMB400,000 range, our ES6 is already ranked at the top five. So that is why we are quite confident that this sales momentum is going to continue for the ES6.
For the ES8, that is the all-new ES8, we will start the delivery around April next year. But all-new ES8 has significantly improved the range and we have already boosted up to 188 improvement on the all-new ES8. So the users’ expectation for the all-new ES8 is actually quite high. That is why we believe the new ES8 will also achieve a very good sales performance.
Right now, our current ES8 is also doing very good in the market. I think you know that we have already sold all the current ES8 and we have no inventory left. We believe that starting from next year, the sales of the ES8 will also be very good. If you look at the specific market segments, for example, Q5 and the GLE, Model X, our performance, intelligence and the smart features, as well as our services are more competitive compared with those brands.
Right now, we have released our EC6, that is the new smart coupe SUV. The feedback is very good from the markets. And right now, I cannot share with you about the specific orders we have received. But the overall situation is actually quite good. We will start the delivery of EC6 in September next year. So the sales of EC6 is not going to significantly impact the overall sales number for the next year. Overall speaking, we are quite confident about the ES6, the ES8, and the EC6 in the specific market segment, respectively.
In terms of the sales strategy, we focus on three aspects. The first one is to continue to improve our product and services. The second one is, we would like to make sure our users can be offered brand ambassador and we can improve the sales number with the user referrals and the word-of-mouth. The third one is to continuously expand our sales network.
In terms of the sales network, the NIO Space will significantly help with our sales numbers for the future. Right now, we have been working with our NIO Space partners to set out the NIO Spaces and improve the coverage of our sales point. The model of the NIO Space is quite efficient. We believe by the end of next year, we should be able to have around 200 NIO Houses and the NIO Spaces altogether. Because at the end of this year, we have already got over 70 NIO Houses and the NIO Spaces combined.
With the increased amount of the NIO Spaces, we can cover the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and other remote places. We have already accumulated many experiences in terms of the NIO Space operations. So we think that this is not going to significantly affect our headcount, because we will heavily rely on the partners to work together with us, although we will have our own people on-site to support our partners in the NIO Spaces. Right now, we have users in 296 cities. With the channel expansions, we believe our sales for the next year is going to be very solid.
Thank you. Your next question is from Lei Wang from CICC. Please go ahead. Evening, Steven, William and Jade. This is Lei speaking from CICC. Congratulations on Steven’s new role, it’s a really nice move. And the vehicle deliveries in the third quarter, that’s really new record high. William and Steven have actually answered part of my questions and I have two follow-ups.
The first one would be that Steven just gave the guidance of 2,000 unit deliveries in the fourth quarter, another high quarter-over-quarter increase. And what’s the exact factors that are viewed that drive the sales up, and are the factors sustainable from the point of view? And would that be possible that you can release backlog order right now?
And the second question will be about the per store deliveries, because William just mentioned we have now around 70 NIO Spaces, right? And that will be leaning about 40 vehicles will be sold per store per month in the first quarter. Is this consistent? Does that mean that for 200 NIO Spaces next year, they’ll be able to deliver 8,000 vehicles per month? Thank you. I will translate my question.
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] [Interpreted] Thanks for your question. At the beginning, I have already mentioned the – starting from the September, the order and the delivery have been witnessing very strong momentum. This is mainly due to three factors. The first one is the competitiveness of our products and the service. The second one is the word-of-mouth under the user referral. The third one is the sales network expansion. Among all these three factors, the product competitiveness is one of the most important factors.
As you can see, NIO has already established the premium brands successfully in the mainstream premium market, that is around RMB300,000 to RMB500,000 price range. And you can see that the premium market players have already launched some products. For example, last year, Jaguar launched their I-PACE. And this year, EQC, E-tron. But after they released their product, we can see the price is around the RMB600,000 to RMB700,000. After comparing their products together with our products, normally, the users will think our product is more competitive. That’s why they choose NIO products.
I think that there is a very important trend we should pay attention to. Starting from the second quarter of this year, the EV sales has declined because of the subsidy reduction. This happens to those commercial vehicles and the lower-end EVs. But for the Tesla and NIO and other brands focusing on the consumer market, our sales momentum is actually quite good.
We believe that the users are quite educated about EVs and ICEs. And for those users, they prefer EVs, that is fine. With it we should have a reasonable share for the mid and large-sized SUV segment, that is around RMB300,000 to RMB400,000 market segments. That segment should have around 1 million unit volumes in terms of the sales.
And in the last months, I understand that there are many concerns about the NIO’s operation. But you can see, NIO is developing in a very healthy way. And this is mainly because of our product competitiveness and the word-of-mouth from our users and the strong execution from our teams. That is why we are quite confident about our future sales, and we believe we can keep and even increase this momentum in the future.
Next year, in terms of the competition landscape, I don’t actually see any – very competitive products from BMW, Audi, Mercedes and Tesla. Right now, people are now getting familiar with the Tesla Model 3 made in China. And if you compare the Model 3 with our products, we believe our product is still very competitive, and we don’t actually belong to the same segment with the Tesla Model 3.
Just now, you mentioned about the sales per store or the sales for the NIO Space and NIO Houses. We think we cannot simply evaluate the effect of the NIO Spaces and NIO Houses by saying how many sales we can achieve in one store, because I have mentioned that 45% of the NIO orders are actually coming from our existing users.
The NIO spaces should be quite good for our results improvement, especially for those places without NIO houses. But we cannot simply evaluate the number of the sales in those NIO spaces by doing this kind of calculation, because for most of the NIO Spaces that we opened in the fourth quarter. So it means that we need to accumulate more data to understand the effectiveness of the NIO Spaces.
In terms of the China market, actually, it is quite big. So for a lot of users, they may have never seen NIO products or EVs in the past. So that is why we think NIO Spaces should be quite good for us to promote our products in those places and people can actually touch and feel our products. But after we accumulate more data and experience in terms of the NIO Space operation, we can share more information with you.
Thank you. Thank you. Your next question is from Fei Fang from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi, William, thanks for the opportunity. Your 8,000 volume guidance, how many ES8 do we have for December? And also moving into 2020, how do we think about the normalized run rate for ES8?
Second question is on battery price and what’s the outlook? And thirdly, if you can comment on the cash outflow. I’d say, is there a quarterly outflow target that the CEO and the CFO is trying to manage the business towards the RMB2 billion outflow per quarter of RMB3 billion beyond which you will think harder about cutting more costs? Thank you. [Foreign Language] [Interpreted] In the Q4, the sales of the ES8 is estimated to be around 1,300, and for ES6, it should be over 6,700. For the ES8, compared with the third quarter, the sales in the fourth quarter has been picking up, and we are very happy to see that ES8 is retaining momentum in the market. Starting from April next year, we are going to deliver the all-new ES8. And we believe ES8 is going to be well-positioned in the market to win over users. Okay. So thank you for your question. Yes, I think a lot of investors have a very close look at our cash flow. First, of course, we need to take every effort to – for cost savings that our base comp work. But if we move on, I would say, for any automaker, the best way to have a good cash flow is to sell more cars.
So although the cash is tight, but thanks to our strong order and delivery momentum. The cash flow from sales is actually very healthy and this is very fundamental for our business. And, of course, if we look at our balance sheet, we will need additional capital until it reaches positive cash flow. We were at the market, as I just said, when we close the financial projects.
In the end, I would say, with the coming support from these ongoing financing projects, product sales trend and cost measures, we believe the company will have sustainable development and operations. So in short, first, savings; second, financing; third, very strong sales. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. We have our next question from Paul Gong from UBS. Please go ahead. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is, based on the current price environment, what quarterly delivery level do we expect to have positive gross margin on vehicle sales? And my second question is just to double-check, does the balance sheet by end of September already reflected Tencent US$200 million CB in it? Because I compared the balance sheet of Q2 and Q3. I didn’t see really an increase – significant increase of non-current liabilities or long-term borrowings, but the cash level still declines. I just want to double-check at the end of September balance sheet already reflected the issuance of the $200 million CB? [Foreign Language] Thanks for your question. In terms of the gross margin, this has always been our important task for 2020. We need to consider this from three aspects. The first one is, sales and pricing; the second one is about the BOM cost reduction, especially the battery cost; and the next one is about our product portfolio. By focusing on those three aspects, we can take some measures to improve the gross margin.
We think for the next year, we should be able to achieve positive gross margin for the whole year. But if you ask about a specific quarter or the specific amount, so we’re not really sure at this moment, because we need to consider this comprehensively regarding the sales and the battery cost reduction, the BOM cost reduction and the efficiency improvement. [Foreign Language] Okay. And Paul, to answer your question, in terms of the US$100 million CB from Tencent. If you review our announcement on September 5, actually, it has two tranches. First, US$100 million for 360 days. So it’s a short-term borrowing. So we booked US$50 million in our short-term borrowings. And also, the other US$50 million is a three-year CB. So we booked that US$50 million in our long-term borrowings. Yes. Thanks, Paul. Thanks. Thank you. We don’t have any other questions as of the moment. Presenters, please continue. Okay. So thank you, everyone, for attending our conference call this quarter, and we look forward to seeing you and hearing from you next quarter. And Happy New Year. Happy New Year… Happy New Year. …to everyone. [Foreign Language] Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for participating.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, go ahead please. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our 2019 Q4 earnings call today. We delivered, a combined 8,224 ES8 and ES6 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019, representing a 71% sequential increase from the prior quarter. Cumulative deliveries of ES8 and ES6 reached 20,565 in 2019, representing an 81% increase from 2018.
The COVID-19 has broken out in China since January 2020. So overall sales and deliveries of the auto industry in China are materially impacted and the passenger vehicle sales in China slumped 41% in total in January and February 2020 compared to the same period last year. Against this backdrop, NIO has delivered a total of 2,305 vehicles in January and February, which is lower than our target prior to the outbreak.
In response to the micro environment, on one hand, we have actively explored a variety of online channels, including live streaming platforms and fully leverage the well developed online functions of new app to promote online sales, new and direct to sales of business process has enabled us to continue our sales efforts during this special time.
On the other hand, from Spring Festival to now, NIO has maintained 24/7 maintenance and power services through over cloud based service system to support users of daily usage of our products and the services system have always due to the arduous test during the outbreak and worldwide recognition of over user community. Thanks to our loyal user community and a superior word of mouth reputation. Recently orders generated through user referral have reached 69%, much higher than the 45% average user referral rate in 2019.
With the joint efforts of our users and teams, the total number of new production orders reached over 2,100 in the past 30 days, representing 70% of the order growth level in December 2019, as the outbreak gradually brought under control in China, new houses and new spaces are cautiously being reopened with increasing food traffic in stores.
Based on the current trend, we would hope with the daily new order rate to return to the level of last December in April. In terms of production, the work resumption has been postponed across China, which has impacted over production and supply chain to various extent. Although over Hefei plant resumed production on February 10 and the production of most of our supply chain partners have basically returned to normal.
Partners located in Hubei Province will still need some time to recover. Constrained by the limited supply capacity, we expect the aggregate deliveries of Q1 2020 to be around 3,400 to 3,600. We have been monitoring the supply chain very closely and have seen positive changes every day. We do see the supply chain recovery has speeded up since the middle of March. So we hope that the production capacity can return to normal in April.
In the first quarter, the safety of our employees and users remained our top priority. Thanks to the efforts of our users and teams. We have weathered a strong and [indiscernible] of time. In particular, thousands of new users joined various public benefit activities during the outbreak and made contributions to the prevention and control initiatives in Hubei and other regions.
Looking forward to 2020, there are many challenges facing the China and the global economy, which is bound to significantly affect the overall auto industry in China. We believe that NIO will stand out from the competition in this difficult market environment. We're confident about our product competitiveness, integrated online and offline operations and innovative business model based on user enterprise.
After the organizational adjustments and the efficiency improvements in 2019, our teams are well prepared to achieve the 2020 sales target, continuously improved gross margins and systematically optimized the overall operational efficiency.
First, facing the pressure of the outbreak. We are still confident to achieve the preset sales target for 2020. NIO's product family will be more competitive and diverse in 2020. In April, NIO will start the delivery of the all new ES8, a smart electric flagship SUV. The all new ES8 has made nearly 188 improvements and most importantly, the NEDC range will be gradually improved. In September, we will kick off the delivery of the EC6, a smart electric Coupe SUV.
In the fourth quarter, our 100 kilowatt hour battery packs will be launched into the market. The iterative product experience is the most important cornerstone for NIO to maintain our leading position in the premium smart electric SUV market in China. In addition, we'll continue our efforts in sales network expansion and build more NIO Spaces, which are estimated to be around 200 by the end of this year.
User referral is another important driver of the sales growth. With the growing user base and industry leading word of mouth reputation, we believe that the orders generated from user referrals will increase at an even faster rate in the future.
Second, gross margin improvement is one of the top objectives of NIO in 2020, with the supply chain optimization, continuous cost reduction of the battery pack and manufacturing cost saving per vehicle brought forward by production going up and the management optimization, we have the confidence to achieve our goals that our gross margin can turn positive in the second quarter and reach two digits by the end of the year.
Third, we will continuously improve operational efficiency. We have made significant organizational optimization and business adjustment in 2019. The overall headcount has reduced from close to 10,000 at the beginning of 2019 to less than 7,000 due to one-off expenses in Q4, the operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 was higher than that of the third quarter. We have basically finished order adjustments, which has laid a solid foundation for 2020.
In 2020, the company has set up very strict expense control and efficiency improvements targets and implemented rigorous measures in daily operations accordingly. We are pleased to see encouraging results year-to-date and expect around 35% expense reduction compared to the prior quarter even under the pressure of the outbreak.
Lastly, with regard to our financing efforts, NIO issued US$435 million convertible notes in February and March to several unaffiliated Asia based investment funds to support the company's daily operations and business development. At this moment, we have already finished all the private placement.
On February 25, we signed the collaboration framework agreement with Hefei municipal government. The JAC-NIO manufacturing plant for ES8, ES6 and EC6 is located in Hefei, which employs a strong automotive and digital legacy and resources. And it's one of the core cities and transportation hubs in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Region.
Under the framework agreement, NIO plans to establish NIO China headquarters in Hefei and Hefei government plans to provide resources and funding support for the long-term growth of NIO China. Both parties expect to sign the definitive agreement before the end of April.
Thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. As being mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for our full year results and other additional details.
Our total revenues in the fourth quarter were RMB2.85 billion or US$400.1 million, representing an increase of 55.1% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter were RMB2.68 billion or US$385.5 million, representing an increase of 54.8% quarter-over-quarter and accounted for 94% of total revenues in this quarter. The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was attributed to higher deliveries achieved from our existing user referrals and the expansion of our sales network through the continued launch of NIO Spaces in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Other sales in the fourth quarter were RMB164.4 million or US$23.6 million, representing an increase of 59.0% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales over last quarter was mainly attributed to the increase of home chargers installed and accessories sold, which was in line with improvement of vehicle sales in the fourth quarter.
Cost of sales in the fourth quarter was RMB3.10 billion or US$445.6 million, representing an increase of 50.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume of the ES6 and ES8.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was negative 8.9% compared with negative 12.1% in the third quarter of 2019. The improvement in gross margin over last quarter was mainly driven by the improvement of vehicle margin. More specifically, vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was negative 6.0% compared with negative 6.8% in the third quarter of 2019. The improvement of vehicle margin was mainly due to the improved efficiency, driven by the increased production and delivery volume of ES6 and ES8.
R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB1.03 billion, represent a decrease of 32.3% year-over-year, an increase of. 0.3% quarter-over-quarter. The slight increase in R&D expenses over last quarter was primarily attributed to the incremental design and development costs for EC6 and all-new ES8 launched in December 2019, offset by less employee compensation due to a reduced number of R&D personnel.
SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB1.55 billion, representing a decrease of 20.5% year-over-year, an increase of 32.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses over last quarter was primarily attributed to increased marketing and promotional activities and additional costs on the optimization of our organization and sales network, offset by less employee compensation due to a reduced number of selling, general and administrative employees. Loss from operations in the fourth quarter was RMB2.83. billion, representing a decrease of 18.0% year-over-year, an increase of 17.3% quarter-over-quarter.
Share-based compensation expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB51.2 million, representing a decrease of 63.9% year-over-year, and a decrease of 27.3% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over last quarter was primarily attributed to the continuous decline of employee numbers, and the impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized using the accelerated method, under which the expenses decreased gradually over the investing period.
Net loss was RMB2.86 billion in the fourth quarter, represent a decrease of 18.2% year-over-year, and an increase of 13.6% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders in this quarter was RMB2.89 billion, represent a decrease of 17.7% year-over-year, and an increase of 13.3% quarter-over-quarter.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the fourth quarter were both RMB2.81 or US$0.40 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB2.73 or US$0.39 per ADS in the fourth quarter.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB1.06 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Now for our business outlook. As William mentioned, for the first quarter of 2020, the company expects deliveries to be between 3,400 and 3,600 vehicles, representing a decrease of approximately 56.2% to 58.7% from the fourth quarter of 2019. The expected decrease is primarily attributed to the constrained production and delivery impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The company also expects the total revenue of the first quarter 2020 to be between RMB1.21 billion to RMB1.27 billion, or between US$173 million to US$183 million. This would represent an decrease of approximately 55.3% to 57.6% from the fourth quarter of 2019. This business outlook reflects the company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Lei Wang of CICC. Please go ahead. Good evening, William and Steven. This is Lei Wang speaking from CICC. Congratulations on the recent financing activities. I do believe that means a lot. So basically I got some questions. So in the business outlook, it guides a quarter delivery between 3,400 to 3,600 in the first quarter of 2020. So do you might provide some guidance on the sales target of this year? So would that be something close to like 30,000 units? That's the first question. Thanks for your question. In our previous remarks that we have provided the guidance for Q1, that is 3,400 to 3,600. Just like we mentioned, this is mainly affected by the production capacity. Although our Hefei plant has resumed production on February 10, but the production capacity is still limited by those supply capacity, especially for those partners located in Hubei Province for the February and March delivery. Although at this moment, most all of the partners have resumed their production, but we do have some limitations and constraints regarding the parts supply. So for the partners in Hubei, they will still need some time to recover, the main challenge for the delivery in January is because of the production constraints, because after we produce our products, we will need to ship our products to the delivery centers and also make the appointment with our users to deliver the products to them. For the first quarter delivery, the main reason of the constraint is because of the production. But just like I mentioned, in the past 30 days, our orders have increased and right now the new orders have accumulated for over 2,100 or close to 2,200. It means that the daily new orders is around 70%. So for the level, it's actually quite similar or actually close to the 70% of the December level last year. At this moment we’re saying -- we're seeing the orders is ramping up. So we're quite confident about our annual sales target because our motto is make to order. So if we can resume the normal production, then it means that we can deliver our products to the users at much -- at a much faster rate. Every day we have accumulated some new orders from the users and at this moment we have around 5,000 order backlog. I cannot give you a specific number regarding our annual sales target, but according to all the data that we’ve shared, we're quite confident to achieve our internal annual sales target. Your next question. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we think that Lei was dropped. So please continue with next analyst, please. Thank you. All right. Sure. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Galves of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So volume was much higher in Q4 versus Q3, but the gross margin only improved a small amount. Can you talk about some of the things that maybe offset the impact of better scale? Yes, definitely. As you mentioned, the volume increase in the fourth quarter as the gross margin slightly increased. The main reason is about the volume mix of the -- our products. We sold all ES6 base version in the fourth quarter. So the selling price is a little bit lower than the ES8. So the -- that's the main reason for the gross margin slight increases in the fourth quarter, yes. The -- yes -- okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then as you’re looking ahead, I think that you said that you're expecting double-digit gross margin by the end of the year, but maybe you could clarify that comment. Can you give us a sense of what volume level that would require to get to that double-digit gross margin target? And if you can achieve that, would that support a cash outflow of neutral, or would do you think that there would still be a cash outflow once you get to double-digit margins on the vehicles? Thank you. Okay. Yes, as William mentioned in his speech and the gross margin improvement in 2020 is mainly because the -- our supply chain optimization and continuous cost reduction of battery pack and also manufacturing cost savings brought forward by production scaling up and management optimization. And we have confidence that we can achieve this in 2020. Regarding the volume and also as we mentioned before, is we have clear time [ph], but it's difficult for us to measure this volume skill here for you. But we’re confident to get -- achieve of this target, yes. I just want to add one point. In terms of the production capacity of the Hefei plant, we think the vast economy of scale should be around 4,000 per month. One shift production. So the one shift production should be around 4,000 per month. If we can get [indiscernible] and probably this can basically support our operation targets. We believe that for this year we should have some opportunity to achieve this. And Dan perhaps some comments from Steven. If you look at our GP margin, it's related with several parameters. Of course, first, the volume and second, that our price. Third, our cost. Of course, we expect -- we don't change our sales target for 2020 and we’re very confident, we can achieve this sales targets, although the outbreak of novel coronavirus in January and February. And if we look at our sales price, we think and we're confident we're able to raise the ASP as more attractive options, such as NIO Pilot. And also, if you look at our cost side, of course, the battery cost were in a rate decline. Then, if we look on our other bond cost, the auto parts from other suppliers, we believe, a 10% decrease is reasonable. Third, and if you look at our previous accounting records, we actually compensate the NIO plant. And that means with the production volume to rise, our manufacturing expenses will gradually drop decline and we expect that to achieve 30% decline this year just from its manufacturing cost. Yes. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Hsiao of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Will and Steven and management team. Thanks for taking time to host the call. Just a few quick question. First of all, could I just have a quick follow-up question regarding the gross margin, because you just mentioned about a different product mix. So could we have a little bit more color about gross margin of EC6, the model launch in the upcoming Septembers? Would that be similar to ES6 or ES8, or could be slightly higher or similar or lower? And separately we noticed that the selling and marketing expenses rose a bit in fourth quarter of last year sequentially. So could we expect that to become the norm or further trend up considering that we target to open up to 200 stores, I mean, NIO Space by end of this year. And lastly, is our collaboration agreement binding on Hefei government before the deal is officially signed by end of April? Will the collaboration of potential investment took place at our China arm, or at listed company level? Thank you. Thanks for your questions, because we haven't disclosed or announced the specific pricing of the EC6. And our EC6 is actually benchmarked model Y, we launched the EC6 at the end of last year. And we received very positive feedback from the public and our users. We will determine the specific pricing of the EC6 based on the market situation. We think probably we will announce the specific pricing around July. Gross margin is a very important objective for the company just like I mentioned to you, in my speech. EC6 shared many components together with ES6. At the same time, EC6's battery costs can be significantly reduced. In terms of the unit cost per watt hour in this Q4 will be reduced by 25% compared with the same period last year. So with all those factors in consideration, we are quite confident about achieving that gross margin target for the EC6 regardless of the pricing.
Just like we have mentioned, NIO Space started from last -- actually last year, Q4. The main cooperation model for the NIO Space is to work together with our partner to set up and expand the NIO Spaces in the market. We work together with the partners based on the orders or the specific transactions that they can achieve in their store. So this transaction is based on the offline traffic and the orders as they can settle in their own NIO Spaces. As of speaking, the NIO Space model is quite efficient and its different from the NIO Houses. We're not going to increase the number of the NIO Houses this year. So we believe that NIO Space will not have a significant impact on our SG&A. And the efficiency of the NIO Space is actually quite high.
Under the collaboration framework agreement with the Hefei municipal government, NIO China is a independent entity for the RMB financing activities. The Hefei municipal government will support the NIO China's long-term growth through the RMB financing project. It's not part of the new Inc [ph] equity financing projects. We haven't signed the definitive agreement yet with the municipal government. After we signed the final agreement, we will disclose the specific details. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. My question -- thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious how you are thinking about the likely sales or pricing outlook for battery electric vehicles, including for your vehicles relative to internal combustion engine vehicles, in light of the almost unprecedented recent decline in the price of oil and presumably soon, gasoline? Thank you. Actually today the China government has adjusted the oil price and reduced the supply 15%. The government will adjust this oil price based on the international oil price, but it will not go any lower than US$40 because as the crude oil price is at -- is US$ 40. At this moment the crude oil price in the international market is around US$30. So it means that the Chinese government will not have any space to reduce the price further. Based on the current price, the cost of EV usage is still much better than that of the combustion car. So we think they will not have any significant changes regarding the cost of usage. I think it's the market consensus that in the long-term EV is going to replace combustion cars. The main reason for this trend is not because of the cost of usage, it's mainly because the EV is better fitted for the autonomous driving technologies and [indiscernible] in terms of the response time of the motor. At the same time, the Chinese government is quite determined in terms of the emission reduction. For example, the government has released many favorable policies for the EVs in terms of the license plate and the tax reductions. So those are the main impetus for the users to choose EV over combustion cars. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. I actually want to clarify several numbers. Number one, is about the gross margin. You mentioned gross margin will be improving in 2020. So is the vehicle gross margin or is the overall gross margin including vehicle, that’s number one, I want to clarify. Second thing is about one-off expense. Can you quantify how big is the size of one-off expense and what's the detail about the expense? That's the second thing. And the third thing is actually you mentioned that in the first quarter, the costs will decline by 35% or another [indiscernible] is that the loss making in the number one quarter would decline by 35%. So what's the base for a decline for 35% in the first quarter this year? That’s the three things I want to clarify. And besides, actually, I’ve one question about the financing, because I think about the share price right now, the CB actually have the potential risk to demand [indiscernible] now converted to the share. So for upcoming, do you have any follow-up or anything up to the [indiscernible], any further financing plan? And actually, you can see in the media report, the automaker match that join your investments such as the GD, such as JC. So do you see any synergy, if you really got a shareholder from that traditional carmaker. For example, you can share their supply chain and there may be the component supply with much lower costs. Thank you. Okay. So I want to start with the GP margin question. Yes, we think we will achieve positive GP margin for second quarter of 2020, and a double-digit GP margin in Q4 of 2020. Of course we -- first we refer it as our vehicle GP margin. And you can see our over -- because vehicle sales accounted for 94% of our total revenue. So our overall revenue -- our overall GP margin will be close to our vehicle GP margin, that’s first. Second, if you look at our other sales GP margin, it also improved in Q4 2019 and we are confident that with our efforts, our other sales GP margin will also improve in 2020. That's the first. And I think, Stanley will give you more explanation about the one-off, one-time cost. Yes, the second question is about the one-off one-time expense. The majority were related to organizational restructuring across all functions, facility leasing contract termination compensation and also the strategy adjustments around the manufacturing and the supply chain. So that's the second question. Those are numbers. Total number is around RMB400 million, okay. That’s the second question. Third is about the our forward looking about the net loss of the first quarter of 2020. The comparison is with the first quarter of 2019. So compared with first quarter of 2019, we expect the first quarter of 2020 will decrease by 35%. Yes, it's quarter-on-quarter comparison. So it's not the OpEx. It's the bottom line. So it's about RMB2.9 billion, decrease 35%. Is that true? So it's not OpEx. It's the bottom line, not net loss. Yes, net loss. Yes. Okay. Yes, net loss. Confirmed net loss, yes. So the fourth question goes to William. As we have been working together with other OEMs in various ways. For example, we have been working together with the JSC in terms of the manufacturing. And we also have a very good collaboration with GAC [ph] in terms of the GAC joint venture. Recently both parties have decided to increase investment in this joint venture and this joint venture is going to kick off the mass production of their vehicle models. We will continue this cooperation with those OEMs. Regarding other OEMs, we will continue to explore other possibilities to work with them in terms of the supply chain and R&D. But in terms of the equity or capital risk factor, we don’t have any specific information that we can disclose at this stage. If we have any information, then we would like it to disclose or we will share this information as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Lei Wang of CICC. Please go ahead. Hi. [Indiscernible] disconnected and I wasn't able to finish the last question. So do we have some guidance on what the CapEx is going to be this year? It was reported that we are about to invest R&D center, a new R&D center and also the second manufacturing site? In terms of the CapEx for 2020, the majority will be used for the new product and model lunch. For example, the tooling required for the product launch. It is a less than US$200 million. In terms of the cooperation with the Hefei municipal government, after we signed a definitive agreement with the government, we are not going to invest to build the R&D center or the manufacturing base in the Hefei municipal city. And this is not going to cause any pressure on our CapEx. Okay. Thanks, William. Very clear. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hello. Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You can ask your question. Right. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Gong of UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, William. Hi, Steven. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. The first one is, I remember in first quarter last year you have to pay -- you have to prepay the battery purchase to CATL for the full year. Is it still the case heading to 2020, heading through this year? This is my first question. And my second question is regarding your assumption on the battery price declined in -- throughout 2020. You mentioned that in Q4 of 2019 your battery cost is 20% cheaper than Q4 of 2018. But in Q4 of 2019 you’re still making negative gross margin despite of 8,000 delivery. So, when you mention by end of this year you are going to achieve double-digit gross profit margin. What's further battery cost decline or assumption [indiscernible]? I think, Steven mentioned 10% decrease on the other bond costs. But I just want to have your assumption on the battery cost assumption for this. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Last year due to the subsidy reduction, the passenger vehicle sales in China has slumped significantly, because our users are private users. And four other OEMs, normally they sell their cars for the operating usage. In this case our sales didn’t decline that significant compared with the sales of other OEMs. That is why right now we are one of the most important partner CATL. This year our cooperation with CATL is going to be even closer. This means we can get a much better deal together with the CATL compared with last year. For example, in terms of the payment terms. In terms of the price, starting from one year and half ago, we have been working together with CATL to reduce the price of the battery. This year we have witnessed significant cost reduction. Starting from the second quarter, we will have continue the cost reduction every quarter. In the fourth quarter of this year, we will launch the 100 kilowatt hour battery pack and the CTC battery pack. With those the new battery packs, we can further reduce the cost of without affecting the performance and the drive range of our vehicle models. The cost -- the unit cost of per watt hours is going to be reduced by 20% compared with last fourth quarter at the battery pack level. So we're confident that we can improve the gross margin. Just like we have mentioned, in terms of the gross margin improvement, the main drivers are the battery cost reduction, other bond cost reduction and the manufacturing cost saving. We're quite confident to see the positive result from those gross margin efforts. Thank you very much. Thank you. That’s very helpful. Very glad to know that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next question is from the line of Ming Li of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Thank you. Thank you, William and the management team for your time. So I just have a few quick questions. So my first question is that right now -- because the overall EV consumption sentiment is still not very strong in China, so how do you think about any new strategy to help your volume sales? I know you talked about NIO products and also the NIO Space expansion, but do you -- will you have any new strategy to have on the volume sales? That’s my first question. Second question, some of the -- your competitors already think -- discuss to use LFP battery to lower the battery cost. But do you think it's a feasible choice for you? Since you have battery swap service and you have a lot of LCM battery for swap. So do you think it's a possible choice or you don't think it's a good choice for you to lower your [indiscernible] cost of battery? That’s my second question. And my third question is that, how [indiscernible] CapEx do you plan to spend on the battery swap and the battery charging station for this year? That’s my third question. Thank you. Yes, it is a quite unique advantage for NIO in terms of the battery related innovations. This year we are going to launch a new concept called battery-as-a-service. This is going to leverage the power swap stations and the swapping technologies we have. It's quite important to improve the overall safety efficiency. In the world, only NIO can provide these kind of services to the users. Users can [indiscernible] the battery or swap the battery and operate the battery according to their specific needs. Right now we have already launched the 84 kilowatt hour battery pack to the users in our battery circulation system. So the users are free to -- are allowed to upgrade their battery pack with this 84 kilowatt hour battery. In terms of the battery-as-a-service, this is going to be a very important strategy for us to boost our self. Besides other strategies we have mentioned, we are now having very close discussions with government authorities regarding the specific policies for the battery-as-a-service. The current progress is quite positive. If there's any kind of important information that we will share with everyone right away. Because we have the swapping technology in place, so we are quite willing to explore different technologies and materials for the battery packs. But when we make these decisions, we will consider the performance experience and the cost. For example, we have the same battery pack size with different kind of energy density, like 100 kilowatt hour battery pack and 84 kilowatt hour battery pack. This year with the P2P [ph] technologies, so we will be able to launch this 100 kilowatt hour battery pack. This is our unique advantage. This means that we should also be free to explore the possibilities in terms of the RFP material. In terms of the swap station and CapEx investment related with the battery, we will increase the investment a little bit this year because our user base is increasing. But overall speaking for this year, it's going to be around RMB100 million. Thank you. Thank you, William. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hey, great. Let me try my luck this time. Thanks, William, Steven and Jade. Just two quick questions. Apologies if this had been covered before. So for the first quarter volume guidance, is it possible to break it out by ES8 and ES6? And then the second question is that we noticed in that cash in the fourth quarter didn't really changed much from the third quarter, despite we still have a RMB2.8 billion loss. So can you maybe walk us through some of the major items in the cash flow statement. What has been sort of driving the better than sort of earnings, free cash flow in the fourth quarter? Thank you. In terms of the sales for the first quarter, the majority of the sales are contributed by the ES6, because we are about to deliver the all-new ES8 in April. This means the orders for the current ES8 is going to decrease because people would like to replace orders for the all-new ES8. Our motto is make to orders, so this is quite unique for us because at the end of last year we have a launch with the all-new ES8 and started to accept the orders from the public. Okay. Regarding the second question about the cash flow of fourth quarter of 2019, I think first it's about we closely monitored our cash position in the fourth quarter. So the operating cash flow, I think decreased compared to the last quarter. Secondly, as we mentioned in our Q3, 2019 earnings release, [indiscernible] CB was closed in the first quarter. So there is still some cash injection in this quarter. So combined with those effect, I think the total net cash outflow is a little bit lower than the total loss. So I think that's the reason. Thank you. And sorry, just want to confirm, [indiscernible] CB was US$100 million, not the inflow -- financing inflow in the fourth quarter? Yes. Okay, great. [Indiscernible] totally US$100 million and the majority came in the fourth quarter. That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. As there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any questions, feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. So this concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Bye. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today. And thank you for participating.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, go ahead, please. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO’s 2020 Q1 Earnings call. In the first quarter of 2020, NIO delivered an aggregate of 3,838 ES8 and ES6. Starting from April, our sales and deliveries have witnessed a solid recovery. We delivered a total of 3,155 ES8 and ES6 in April, representing a robust 105.8% month-over-month growth. We are extremely proud that since October 2019, new ES6 has outperformed others and ranked as the top-selling electric SUV in China auto market for 7 consecutive months, it is the only electric vehicle among the top 10 best-selling luxury midsized SUVs.
Due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall passenger vehicle sales in China has slumped by 41% year-over-year yet our Q1 deliveries decreased only by 3.8% compared with the same period of 2019, our bucking the trend performance is mainly attributable to the end-to-end direct sales business process and the cloud-based service system. Our products and services systems have withstood the arduous test during this unprecedented outbreak and won wide recognition from the market and users. On April 19, the all-new ES8 commenced deliveries to users. It boasts over 180 improvements with the NEDC range reaching up to 580 kilometers. With further enhancement and its comprehensive competitiveness the all-new ES8 has received rave reviews across the board from the users and media after the deliveries. As the novel coronavirus outbreak has been brought under control in China, since April, our business operations have started to return to normalcy in every aspect, including supply chain, manufacturing, sales, services and R&D. The supply chain and manufacturing have gradually recovered from the pandemic. In the meantime, our R&D activities are picking up speed, and the off-line sales network is also bouncing back.
Starting from April, we have been continuously exploring innovative sales channels leveraging the advantages of both online and off-line platforms. In 2020, we have opened 44 new NIO Spaces in 24 cities. So far, we have opened 22 NIO Houses and 92 NIO Spaces in 76 cities around China. We will continue to open more efficient and flexible NIO Spaces to increase our off-line touch points and community presence. Since late April, our daily new order rate has already returned to the level before the outbreak. In light of the normalization of supply chain and production, we are confident to deliver 9,500 to 10,000 ES8 and ES6 in total in the second quarter, reaching all-time high in our quarterly deliveries. As for the gross margin, along with the strong recovery of quarterly deliveries, reduction of the battery pack and other comp costs, optimization of manufacturing expenses and efficiency and the steady rise of the average selling price, we expect our overall gross margin to substantially improve and the vehicle gross margin to reach over 5% in the second quarter this year. After a series of restructuring and operational optimization initiatives across the company since 2019, our overall efficiency has been significantly improved. In the first quarter 2020, the company SG&A has dropped by 45.1% from Q4 2019 and the operating loss has decreased by 44.4% quarter-over-quarter. In the second quarter, the SG&A and R&D expenses will increase to some extent. But considering our gross margin improvement, we are still confident to reduce operating loss.
Next, I like to share with you the latest progress on two important tasks in the second quarter. First, the progress on the innovative business model of a battery as a service, it is a widely acknowledged that we have always been working on the chargeable, swappable, and upgradable battery service model based on the separation of vehicle and battery. That can lower the initial purchase price and enable users to continuously upgrade the battery and enjoy better power replenishment experience. NIO owns more than 1,200 battery swap-related patents on the vehicle battery pack, battery swap stations, and cloud service solutions. To date, we have deployed 131 battery swap stations in 58 cities nationwide and completed over 500,000 battery swaps accumulatively. NIO’s innovative business model based on the separation of battery and vehicle has won wide recognition from the users and the industry.
In April, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance promptly issued the latest new energy vehicle subsidy policy, which clearly stated to encourage the development of battery swap technology and innovative business models based on the separation of battery and vehicles. With the new policy, NIO is the only premium EV brand with products priced over RMB300,000 yet still receiving the national EV subsidy. Based on the latest published policy, we will speed up the development of best products and service solutions which are planned to release to users in the second half of this year. As the time goes on, we believe our competitive edge enhanced by best will become more self-evident.
Last but not least, I would like to share with you the progress of NIO China project. On April 29, NIO entered into definitive agreements with a group of strategic investors. Under the agreement, NIO will inject its core businesses and assets in China into NIO China including vehicle research and development, supply chain, sales and services and NIO Power. The strategic investors will invest in aggregate of RMB7 billion into NIO China. In addition, NIO will invest RMB4.26 billion into NIO China. Upon the completion of the investment NIO will hold 75.9% of controlling equity interest in NIO China, while the strategic investors will collectively hold the remaining 24.1%, and NIO China will be a subsidiary of NIO. The strategic investment in NIO China is another important milestone of NIO for its long-term growth. With investment, NIO will have sufficient funds to support its business development and to open RMB financing channels in order to enhance its leadership in products and the technologies of smart electric vehicles and offer services exceeding users’ expectations. The launch of NIO China headquarters in Hefei will enable NIO to improve its operational efficiency and to sustain its growth and competitiveness in the long run. The transactions are proceeding well according to plan. We are fully confident that it will be closed before the end of June 2020. Thank you for your support.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2020. And to mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenue in the first quarter was RMB1.37 billion or $193.8 million, representing a decrease of 51.8% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 15.9% year-over-year. The decrease in total revenues quarter-over-quarter was due to decrease of vehicle deliveries during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Our total revenues are made of 2 parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the first quarter were RMB1.36 billion or $177.3 million, representing a decrease of 53.2% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 18.2% year-over-year. Vehicle sales accounted for 92% of total revenues in this quarter.
Other sales in the first quarter were RMB115.4 million or $16.4 million, representing a decrease of 29.2% quarter-over-quarter and an increase of 21.2% year-over-year. The decrease in other sales over last quarter was mainly attributed to decreased revenues derived from the home chargers installed and accessories sold, which were in line with the decreased sales – vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2020.
Cost of sales in the first quarter was RMB1.54 billion or $217.4 million, representing a decrease of 50.4% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 16.8% year-over-year. The decrease in cost of sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the decrease of delivery volume of the ES6 and ES8 in the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin in the first quarter was negative 12.2% compared with negative 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and negative 13.4% in the same quarter of 2019. The decrease of gross margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the decrease of vehicle margin in the first quarter of 2020. More specifically, vehicle margin in the first quarter was negative 7.4% compared with negative 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a negative 7.2% in the same quarter of 2019. The decrease of vehicle margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by the decrease of production and delivery volume of ES6 and ES8 in the first quarter of 2020.
R&D expenses in the first quarter were RMB522.4 million, representing a decrease of 49.1% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 51.6% year-over-year. The substantial decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak that caused the significant reduction of design and development activities.
SG&A expenses in the first quarter were RMB848.3 million, representing a decrease of 45.1% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 35.7% year-over-year. The decrease over the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily attributed to some one-off expenses incurred for the optimization of our sales network structure in late 2019 and the COVID-19 outbreak that caused significant decrease of marketing and promotional activities as well as the decrease of activities in business support functions in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease of R&D expenses and SG&A expenses was also attributed to the improvement of operating efficiency resulting from our operation optimization and cost control efforts. Loss from operations in the first quarter was RMB1.57 billion, representing a decrease of 44.4% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 40% year-over-year.
Share-based compensation expenses in the first quarter were RMB32.4 million, representing a decrease of 36.8% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 72.9% year-over-year. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses over the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily attributed to the continuous decline in the number of employees and the impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized by using the accelerated method previously.
Net loss was RMB1.69 billion in the first quarter, representing a decrease of 40.9% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 35.5% year-over-year. Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders in this quarter was RMB1.72 billion, representing a decrease of 40.5% quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of 35% year-over-year. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the first quarter, were both RMB1.66 or $0.23 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB1.60 or $0.22 per ADS in the first quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB2.40 billion as of March 31st, 2020.
And now for business outlook, as William mentioned, for the second quarter of 2020, the company expects deliveries to be between 9,500 and 10,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 147.5% to 160.6% from the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of approximately 167.4% to 181.5% from the second quarter of 2019. The company also expects the total revenues of the second quarter of 2020 to be between RMB3.37 billion to RMB3.53 billion or between $475.7 million to $499.1 million. This would represent an increase of approximately 145.5% to 157.6% from the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of approximately 123.3% to 134.3% from the second quarter of 2019. This business outlook reflects the company’s current and preliminary review on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Operator, let’s start the Q&A session, please. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Hi, William, Steven, Jade, I’m Tim. Congratulations on the solid progress and thanks for taking my questions. So just two quick questions, first is about Volkswagen strategic move of purchasing a big stake in JAC. Although we know that deal might take place at parent level and shouldn’t have any immediate impact to your current partnership with JAC, but were you concerned about the long-term collaboration with JAC or that would urge NIO to reconsider the capacity expansion plans or alternative manufacturing partner? That’s the first question. And my second question is about our agreement with the Hefei investors. According to the details shared, I think the NIO-Hefei needs to apply for IPO within four years and complete that deal within five years after the initial investment. So could you please share a little bit more color regarding the potential listing with the current progress, the updated schedule and any expectation from you or any thoughts? That’s my two questions. Thank you. Thank you for your questions. Recently, we do hear a lot of market speculations about the in-depth cooperation between Volkswagen and JAC. To be honest, we don’t really know much about the details. Although JAC has also issued some comments about the speculation, but if we are going to have more automakers located in Hefei I think this is a good news for us because this is going to be beneficial for the development of supply chain and production capacity in Hefei. Our cooperation with JAC is a win-win corporation. So if JAC is going to work very closely with Volkswagen, which we’re not really sure, but if this is the case, we think this is not going to affect our manufacturing. If they’re going to work very closely together, we think this is very beneficial for our cooperation with JAC. In terms of the question on the NIO China, from the strategic perspective, NIO China opens the RMB financing channel for NIO. So we’re very happy to enter the definitive agreements with a group of investors. According to our preliminary research, we believe that NIO China meets the requirements to go public in China, but we will make this a dynamic decision based on the market situation. Our strategy is NIO Inc. is going to hold the controlling stake in NIO China for the long-term. According to our previous press release, NIO Inc. has the redemption rights and the warrants on the NIO China projects. So overall speaking NIO Inc. can have the long-term controlling stake in NIO China. According to our previous annual report, we have the right for the redemption and the warrants on the NIO China. Actually, if you refer to the annual report that the company filed in early May, we have filed the investment agreement for the strategic investment in NIO China. According to that, NIO Inc. has the warrant to purchase more shares for NIO China. And also, we have the repurchase right of the shares for the strategic investors for partial of their shareholdings in the future. Yes, thank you Jade. Tim Hsiao, thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Thank you. Hi, everyone. I actually got three questions. Number one about the order, if you recall in the last call you already provided orders in the past 30 days. So right now can you provide one now in the past 30 days how much order you received? And what’s the order flow? Because there was no vehicle deliveries in the end of April, just the last week, you got 2,000 orders. That’s why I want to get a number what’s the order in the past 30 days? That’s number one. Number two, actually, is about gross margin in the second quarter. You mentioned vehicle gross margin would go to about 5%. Can you provide a guidance for the overall gross margin, not just the vehicle but also including everything, with better gross margin overall will we turn positive in the second quarter? That’s my second question. And my last question about the potential risk that came from the U.S. delisting. Think about recent China-U.S. relation, naturally had some news flow about all the Chinese companies having delisting risk. So do you have any alternative, let’s say, to list in Hong Kong or actually, your NIO China may have prepared for stop the IPO? And what are your – I mean, alternative plan if you have to be delisted in the U.S.? Thank you. Thank you for your question. Actually, since the late April, our order growth rate has returned to the level before the outbreak. Our current order growth momentum is actually quite strong for the last 30 days because we had the live streaming event and other activities. So at this moment, I cannot disclose the specific number of the orders we received in the last 30 days. But what I can say now is that the order growth momentum is very positive. In terms of the gross margins, we believe the vehicle gross margin can be over 5%. But for the overall gross margin because we have implemented a series of efficiency improvement and cost control measures, so our estimation is it should be over 3%. Thank you for your question. I would like to answer your question about the impact of the new set of deal on NIO Inc. We have noticed that a few Chinese companies have achieved agility in exchanges of the U.S. and UK, such as Alibaba. Looking forward, we will actually and closely monitor the changes and trends of the markets and adopt plans that best serve the interests of NIO Inc.’s investors and shareholders. I think that’s our comment to your question. Okay, thank you. I have a very quick follow-up on first one. Can – right now, you actually undersupply or actually is there a overcapacity? So which means there is so much demand, what’s the maximum monthly supply volume? What’s the number, maximum capacity right now? In fact, a lot of users or actually many users have been waiting for the deliveries. For example, users of the ES8 and ES6, it will be even longer for the users of the ES6 – EC6. In the Hefei plant under one shift, the monthly production capacity should be around 4,000 units with 15 GPH and this means that the workers will need to work around 10 hours every day. But because some supply chain partners in our supply chain, they have some constraints on the production capacity, which means the production capacity for those supply chain partners is around 3,400 to 3,500. So although we still have some capacity in our own Hefei plant, but the overall capacity in the supply chain is limited. We understand that many users have been waiting for the vehicle deliveries. That is why we would like to boost the capacity in the overall supply chain system, which means our partners will also need to increase their production capacity. This requires systematic efforts across the supply chain. According to our plans, around August and September, we should be able to increase the monthly production capacity to around 4,500 to 5,000. Overall speaking, we are quite conservative in terms of the production capacity increase. But we would like to strike a balance between the order growth and our production capacity increase, considering the strong momentum on the demand side. Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lei Wang of CICC. Please ask your question. Thanks for waiting. Thanks Steven. This is Lei Wang speaking from CICC. Congrats on very strong deliveries. I have two questions, if you don’t mind. So we have achieved a historically low SG&A and R&D expenses in the first quarter. That’s mainly attributed to the virus outbreak, I believe. Can we have your guidance on the operating expense for the next few quarters? That was the first question. And the second question is about the deal again because as the last day of the first quarter, we have cash and equivalents around like RMB2.4 billion, while we show just about like total RMB2.5 billion cash before June 2020. So do we need to issue new comparable bonds for issue the new private placements? [Foreign Language] Okay. This is Stanley. Regarding the first question, in Q1 2020, we have seen expected results from the cost control efforts, including the organization optimization and some restructuring initiatives. And expenses in Q2 and going forward, I think will increase quarter-over-quarter compared with Q1 due to more R&D and marketing activities being performed in Q2. But considering our gross margin improvements, we are still confident to reduce the operating loss, and we expect the trend to continue in 2020. Yes, that’s all for question one. Okay. So on – for your second question, yes, you’re right, we have RMB2.4 billion on our balance sheet, and we will inject RMB2.4 billion into NIO China. So first of all, we still have some cash, as you see in our balance sheet, unused from the previously, which can be injected into NIO China as part of the investment from NIO Inc. And then we will closely monitor the market and determine future financing plans to support our further cash injections. And yes, that’s all. Follow-up quick question on the OpEx because we have roughly RMB500 million monthly OpEx in the first quarter. And what’s the estimation on the absolute dollar amount for the next few quarters, like RMB700 million sounds like a reasonable one or even lower? Operating expense wise, as I mentioned, I think there will be an increase in Q2, since the more R&D and marketing activities, yes. But generally, the operating loss, I think will continue to be reduced. So the exact number… I don’t think that we are supposed to give the guidance on the absolute dollar amount of the expenses for the current quarter. But our goal is to reduce the operating loss through the gross margin gains, as well as efficiencies through controlling the operating expenses. Okay fully understood. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Your next question comes from the line of Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Hi, congratulations on the strong results. My first question is about vehicle margin. How would you guide vehicle margin to progress beyond second quarter’s 5%? Are we still tracking toward double-digit vehicle margin by the fourth quarter? That’s the first question for me. Second question is how many of your cars were sold in NIO Houses versus NIO Space in the first quarter and also in April? Okay. The first question about the vehicle margin, we still expect the gross margin to expect double digits in – by the end of 2020 with further decrease in bond cost, including the battery package and also sales of more products with higher gross margin and continued optimization of our manufacturing cost, yes. In terms of the first question for the gross margin, we still would like to keep our guidance regarding the double-digit gross margin by the end of this year. At this moment, we are still quite confident to achieve this objective. With respect to your second question, I would like to say that at this moment, most of the vehicle sales happens in the NIO Houses and the online channels. This is mainly because the NIO Houses are located in those big cities. But we believe NIO Spaces are going to play a very important role in the future, especially in terms of the channel expansions in the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities, and it’s going to play a very bigger role in the third quarter for the channel expansion in those lower tiered cities. Overall speaking, currently, 70% of the vehicle sales are through the NIO Houses and the online touch points. That’s great. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Lee Ming-Hsun of Bank of America. Please ask your question. Lee Ming-Hsun of Bank of America, your line is now open. Thank you. Hi William and the management team and congrats on the good results. So I have few questions. My first question is that when will you start to deliver EC6 and also decide a price? And also when will you start to ship the 100 kilowatt hour battery with your cars. And will there be any meaningful spec change, for example, like a driving range improvement and also increase of weight or overall the weight will be maintained similar level compared to your current 84 kilowatt hour model, the reason I’m asking is because I also want to know that when you start to use some more advanced cells to pack the battery to improve the battery density so that the horsepower can be maintained or even improved, even you use a bigger size battery. And my third question is regarding your cooperation with Hefei government. So besides the investment from Hefei, I believe Hefei will also give you more support from other, I think, financial aspect. So could you elaborate more on support and cooperation from Hefei government? Thank you. Our plan is to start the deliveries of the EC6 in September and the delivery of the 100 kilowatt hour battery pack in the fourth quarter. For the battery pack, the current battery pack will upgrade within the same size. The weight will not change, but the power density will improve. In this case, it’s not going to impact on the performance of the vehicle. And this is one of the parameters and the criteria in our technology development. This is a very important endorsement to offer technical competence because within the same battery pack size, we can upgrade the battery from the 70 kilowatt hour to 84 kilowatt hour. And this year, we’re going to shift to 100 kilowatt hour battery pack. In terms of our cooperation and development in Hefei regarding NIO China, we will work together with Hefei government and other related departments to work out the specific policies. We believe we should be able to get some preferential and supportive policies. Thank you, William. Sorry, I got one more quick question, so maybe it’s still early, but for the year-end NIO Day will you consider to launch another new product as per your previous guidance, but then the launch probably will be postponed to 2021 or 2022? So in this year-end, there is no possibility to launch sedan or other new models? Thank you. Thanks for your question. I would understand everyone is looking forward to the NIO Day and of a new product launch. This actually proves we have a very high product development and R&D efficiency. Because starting from the NIO Day in 2017, we launched our new product every year on the NIO Day. Of course, we don’t want to break this tradition but at this moment we cannot disclose the specific details. Got it. Thank you, William. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jiajie Shen of JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Hi, William and Steven. Yes, hi. It’s Nick Lai from JPMorgan, thank you for taking my question. I know that we have a few minutes only left so two very simple high-level questions. The first one on the cash flow, can you walk us through on the cash flow, yes, in terms of inflow and outflow? You mentioned earlier in the first quarter, we issued roughly about $435 million CP. That’s roughly about RMB3 billion. But at the same time, for the investment in China – in NIO Inc. The first two installments due in June, we need to invest altogether RMB2.5 billion and on top of that, presumably, at each quarter, the cash burn is somewhere about RMB1.5 billion to RMB2 billion. So if you can provide some number or guidance on the quarterly cash inflow and also that will be appreciated? And should we assume with all the investment maybe in the next one year we probably don’t need to go to capital market and raise funds again. So that’s a free cash flow related question. And the second simple question is really on volume. I remember, in 2019, we had about 5,000 units of backlog order. Can you give us an update of that number by first quarter? And also 2Q, the guidance of 9,500 to 10,000 units of delivery, is the split between ES8 and ES6 similar to first quarter? Then lastly, on EC6, new model, how should we think about volume? Would it be similar or close to ES6? Thanks. Okay. So thank you for your questions. This is Jade. I’m going to answer the first question that you have. Yes, as of the – at the end of the first quarter, we did have about RMB2.4 billion as cash on our balance sheet thanks to the CPs that we have reached in the first quarter, which has supported our operating and cash needs. And also that the rest of the money that we have right now definitely can be injected from NIO Inc. to NIO China for the installment as the investment we need to make in NIO China. So as for the future plans of the cash injection, we are going to monitor the market very carefully and see what’s the best time and the appropriate method to raise the capital in the future. And we definitely will get sufficient cash to support our future business development and expansion. So that is on the cash side. And on your second question regarding the orders, I think William can answer some on that. At this moment, we cannot disclose the specific number of the order backlog. But according to our data, the current backlog should be over 5,000, just like you mentioned. In terms of the product mix of the ES8 and ES6, as the starting price of the ES8 is CNY 110,000 more than that of the ES6. So it’s quite natural that ES6 has a higher volume compared with the ES8. But after we start the delivery of the ES8, we also need some time to ramp up the production, the sales and the deliveries to the users. According to our current data, the percentage of the ES8 and ES6 should be one two three. And this is because of the specific market segment. For the EC6 because we haven’t released the specific pricing yet, we still need some time to understand what should be the pricing strategy for the EC6 and what is our target user group for the EC6. So we will need to understand those specific information to have a clear picture for the market demand. At that time, we also need to make a dynamic decision based on the production capacity, competition landscape and our product strategy to determine the pricing. At this moment, we have received some intention orders, but because we haven’t released the pricing yet, so we cannot receive the nonrefundable orders at this moment. Yes, that’s very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. As there are no further questions now, I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, again, for joining us today. If you have any questions, just feel free to contact us through the contact information provided on our IR website. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect the line. Thank you. Stay safe. Thank you everyone.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, go ahead, please. Hello, everyone thank you for joining NIO’s 2020 Q2 earnings call. In the second quarter of 2020, NIO achieved record quarterly deliveries of over 10,000 units and delivered an aggregate of 10,331 ES8 and ES6, representing a strong growth of 119.8% year-over-year and 169.2% quarter-over-quarter. In July 2020, NIO delivered 3,533 units, marking the second highest monthly delivery results. The cumulative deliveries in the first seven months of 2020 increased by 111.3% over the same period of 2019. Starting from October 2019, ES6 has ranked as the top selling SUV across all EV sectors in China.
For the first half of this year, ES8 has also achieved number one in sales among mid to large sized luxury electric SUVs priced above RMB400,000 in China. In the third quarter, we are confident to achieve a new quarterly record of 11,000 to 11,500 deliveries.
As for the gross margins, with the strong momentum of quarterly deliveries, vehicle’s average selling price, reduction of battery pack and other BOM costs and improvement of manufacturing efficiency, our gross margin has substantially increased in the second quarter. The vehicle margin and gross margin reached 9.7% and 8.4% respectively, far above our previous guidance of 5% and 3%. We will continue to improve our gross margin and expect our vehicle margin and gross margin to both exceed 10% in the second half of this year.
With the gross margin turning positive and operational efficiency improving comprehensively across the company, the operating loss of the second quarter has further narrowed to RMB1.16 billion, representing a decrease of 64% year-over-year and a decrease of 26.1% quarter-over-quarter. The significant increase in deliveries and the direct sales model and the great support from supply chain partners have enabled us to achieve positive operating cash flow for the first time in our history.
In the second quarter of 2020 -- the second quarter of 2020 is a milestone quarter for us. NIO has made significant breakthroughs in sales, gross margin, operational efficiency and cash flow. After our enduring efforts in the past year, we have found our pace to implement efficient management and solid execution on near term operational objectives, and meanwhile, to make decisive investments in R&D and services for our long-term competitive edges.
Next, I’d like to share with you our recent key priorities. With respect to R&D, as the company overall situation improve, we have accelerated the new product development and will increase our investment in autonomous driving technology. So, we can develop industry leading technologies to maintain the long-term competitiveness of our products.
In terms of project, the EC6, our smart electric coupe SUV was officially launched on July 24, with a pre-subsidy price starting from RMB368,000. It has been very well received by the users and the market and presented a stronger order performance above our expectations. The mass production of EC6 is proceeding well according to plan and we will commence deliveries in late September.
At full production capacity, the manufacturing team is going to increase the production rate of the Hefei plant from 15 jobs per hours to 20 jobs per hour, while working together with supply chain partners to improve their capacity at the same time. By late August or early September, the overall supply chain capacity on a single shift is expected to reach 4,000 to 5,000 units per month.
Regarding sales and service network, we have opened 22 NIO Houses and 119 NIO Spaces in 89 cities, and 142 battery swap stations in 63 cities in China. Moving forward, we will further expand the coverage of the battery swap stations and NIO Spaces to better serve our users.
In the meantime, we have also made profound progress with the innovative business model of battery-as-a-service, namely the decoupling of battery from the vehicle. We have completed the necessary product homologation and certification required to be qualified to sell vehicles and batteries separately.
The process of the first vehicle under the BaaS model has been validated in insurance purchase, loan application and license plates registration. This is a breakthrough moment in our technology and business innovation. Currently, we're still working on the final preparation for the official offering of our BaaS solution, which will be released publicly in the third quarter.
Along with the increasing recognition from the users, government and industries, we believe the advantages of our chargeable, swappable and upgradable products and services systems will become more self-evident.
As we deliver more and more vehicles, our user base is growing, while the user community is maturing. On August 8, 2020, the NIO Day 2020 Host City Bidding Campaign came to a conclusion. Over 40,000 new users actively participated in the voting. After fierce but friendly competition, Chengdu stood out among 10 cities and won the bid to host the NIO Day 2020.
Every little bit of our progress will not be achieved without the trust and support of our users. The bidding campaign of NIO Day 2020 has once again demonstrated the vibrancy and the enthusiasm of the NIO community.
I'd like to thank our users and everyone for their support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Okay. Thank you, William. I’ll now go over our key financial results for the second quarter of 2020. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earning press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the second quarter were RMB3.72 billion or US$526.4 million, representing increase of 146.5% year-over-year, an increase of 171.1% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the second quarter were RMB3.49 billion or US$493.4 million, accounting for 94% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 146.5% year-over-year, an increase of 177.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was primarily due to the increase of vehicle deliveries of ES6 which began its first deliveries in late June 2019.
Other sales in the second quarter were RMB232.8 million or US$33 million, representing an increase of 147.7% year-over-year, an increase of 100% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was really attributed to increased revenues derived from the service package and energy packages subscribed, home charger installed and accessories sold which were in line with increased volume in the second quarter of 2020.
Cost of sales in the second quarter was RMB3.41 billion or US$482.1 million, representing an increase of 69.2% year-over-year, an increase of 121.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of delivered volume in the second quarter of 2020.
Gross profit in the second quarter of 2020 was RMB313.1 million, or US$44.3 million, representing an increase of 162.1% year-over-year, an increase of 286.9% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in gross profit year-over-year was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales and higher gross margin in the second quarter of 2020.
Gross margin in second quarter of 2020 was 8.4% compared with 33.4% in the same quarter of 2019 and negative 12.2% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020. More specifically, vehicle margin in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.7% compared with negative 24.1% in the same quarter of 2019 and negative 7.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin was mainly driven by the decrease in purchase price of certain materials and lower unit manufacturing cost attributed from increased production volume in the second quarter of 2020.
Besides above, the increase of vehicle margin year-over-year was also attributable to the impact of one-off cost in relation to the company's voluntary battery recall in the second quarter of 2019.
R&D expenses in the second quarter were RMB545.2 million or US$77.2 million, representing a decrease of 58.1% year-over-year, an increase of 4.4% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses year-over-year was primarily attributable to incurrence of expenses relating to rigorous testing activities of ES6 in the second quarter of 2019 before its mass production.
SG&A expenses in the second quarter were RMB936.8 million or US$132.6 million, which is a decrease of 34.1% year-over-year, an increase of 10.4% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily driven by the company’s overall cost saving efforts and improved operating efficiency in marketing and other supporting functions.
Loss from operations in the second quarter was RMB1.6 billion, or US$164.2 million, representing a decrease of 64% year-over-year and a decrease of 26.1% quarter-over-quarter.
Share-based compensation expenses in the second quarter were RMB45.3 million, or US$6.4 million, representing a decrease of 50.9% year-over-year, an increase of 39.8% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in share-based compensation expenses year-over-year was primarily due to less options granted driven by the decline in the number of employees and impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized by using the accelerated method, under which the expenses decrease gradually over the vesting period.
Net loss in the second quarter was RMB1.18 billion or US$166.5 million, representing decrease of 64.2% year-over-year, and a decrease [Audio Gap]. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the second quarter was RMB1.21 billion or US$171 million, representing a decrease of 63.6% year-over-year, a decrease of 29.9% quarter-over-quarter.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the second quarter were both RMB1.15 or US$0.16 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB1.08 or US$0.15 per ADS in second quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 11.17 billion or US$1.58 billion as of June 30, 2020.
And now, for our business outlook, as William mentioned, for the third quarter of 2020, the company expects deliveries to be between 11,000 to 11,500 vehicles, which is an increase of approximately 129.2% to 139.6% from the same quarter of 2019, an increase of approximately 6.5% to 11.3% from the second quarter of 2020.
The company also expects the total revenue of the third quarter 2020 to be between RMB4.05 billion to RMB4.21 billion or between US$572.9 million to US$596.2 million. This represents an increase of approximately 120.4% to 129.3% from the same quarter of 2019, an increase of approximately 8.8% to 13.3% from the second quarter of 2020. This business outlook reflects the company’s current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I’ll now turn the call over to operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Yes, sir, certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We have the first question from line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. So, two quick questions. The first one, regarding second quarter’s gross margin because it came in as a strong base versus previous guidance, I think in addition to the strong scale because you just mentioned also it was due to high average revenue per vehicle. So could we have a rough idea, what the gross margin difference between like ES8, and ES6 at the moment? And could we expect ES6 margin to reach similar level as ES8 with additional contribution from ES6 later this year? And my second question is about R&D expenses, because if we look at the stage in first half, I think that R&D expenses are on degree control with around like 500 million to 600 million per quarter, despite the market launch. So would this be the normalized level? Because as William mentioned about the investment in new vehicle development and also the autonomous driving technology. So could we have the -- also have the rough breakdown about how many percentage of the R&D is now for the vehicle development and the rest like the autonomous driving and other technology? Thank you. This is Stanley. For the first question on how the gross margin of ES8 and ES6. Generally, the gross margin of ES8 is higher than ES6. And we are trying to improve both the two models in the future but we won't break down details of margins of each model. Okay? I would like to answer the second question regarding the R&D investment. Right now we'd like to control the R&D investment within RMB3 billion every year, including the labor cost, suppliers, EDT cost. In terms of the breakdown, of course, the percentage we invested for the vehicle related R&D is higher. But just like I mentioned, we will increase our investment on the autonomous driving technology. Right now we have already got a team of almost 200 people focusing on autonomous driving technology development, which accounts for a fixed part of the R&D cost.
For the next generation, on autonomous driving technology, we are going to increase our investment. But at a normal pace, just like I mentioned, it should be around RMB500 million to RMB600 million for one quarter. But for some quarter because of other project development cadence, we may need to increase this investment. Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Actually, I have got three questions on autonomous. Question number one, about launch timing of their two features, voice NGP, navigation-guided pilot. And second about their standard features, when will be they launched because they have been assured in their NIO apps. Will they maybe come up this year? So, I just wanted to know exact timing. And secondly, penetration, because you are going to pay -- for such a feature you’re going to pay additional RMB39,000 as a package. So, what's the penetration right now and what's the ratio that’s been moving in the past few quarter? And the third one, on the next generation autonomous which is Level 4, it crossed the media, you partnered with Mobileye on the EyeQ5 and just what’s the timing for the launch of the Level 4? Thank you Thanks for the question. Regarding the navigate-on-pilot feature, we're now doing rigorous tests on this feature and we plan to release this within 2020. However, regarding the new buy assembling feature, because of the hardware constraints, our feature is not as competitive as Tesla's new buy assembling, because our features can only support getting out and in the parking space, so I don't want to mislead the users. But together with the HD Map, we believe over navigate-on-pilot can achieve a very good performance.
Regarding the second question for the take rate of the navigate-on-pilot, we have the Founders Edition which accounted for around 10,000 units. This Founders Edition has the NOP as a standard feature. So this is quite helpful with the take rate of our speaking. But normally speaking, the take rate for the NOP right now is around -- right now the take rate of the new pilot is around 25%. This year, we have a released a selected new pilot, which is priced around RMB10,000 which has enjoyed a much better take rate.
For the next generation autonomous driving technology, our new technology platform 2.0, right now we are speeding up our development pace for this new technology platform, but it's still too early to share any specific information regarding the technology roadmap. All I can say right now is we set very high bar for ourselves for this next generation platform and we have been working on the autonomous driving technology development. In 2018 when we released the ES8, we were the first car to be equipped with the Mobileye EyeQ4 chipset. Other competitors, they launched the car with EyeQ4 chipset around one year later. So it shows we have much more experience in terms of the mass production and autonomous driving. Our experience in this regard has been tested and verified. So for the next generation platform, we would like to set a much higher standard for ourselves and we will keep you guys updated at a timely manner.
But here I would like to emphasize that we don't actually use the Level 3 or Level 4 to define our technologies. We use two different criteria from the users’ interest perspective. The first one is we focus on how much time we can free up for the users. And the second criteria is, how many accident we can reduce compared with the human driver. We believe this two criteria are more important than the definition of Level 3 and Level 4. Thank you for the question. Can I have another follow-up? Please, please. Okay, thank you. Actually, I follow website, now you guys may go to Germany later this year. So I just wanted to know your global jump there or just limited to China, what’s your future plan for the overseas expansion? From day one, NIO is different from other companies. We are a global setup. So we have kept our normal operation in the San Jose and German office even despite the most difficult times in last year. Even with the COVID-19, we still operate normally in the overseas office. So we are now doing the preliminary research regarding the international market entry including the product preparation, team building and also the market entry planning. But this year, I believe everyone understand, it's not a very good year for us to enter the international market. We understand many overseas media pay great attention to our products, after the renowned European, U.S. media tested our vehicle they also speak very highly of our vehicle. So we would like to do this step by step and build up our capabilities to enter the global market. So I’d like to ask for your patience. Thank you. We have our earnings next question from the line of Lei Wang from CICC. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good evening, Will and Steven. This is Wang Lei speaking from CICC. Congratulations on the positive cash flow and better-than-expected gross margin. That's for sure a good move. I have three questions on the financials. So the first question goes with the gross margin. I know William just guided GM above 10% by end of this year. But considering we just have hit a 9% -- a 9.7% vehicle gross margin by second quarter already, can we have an updated gross margin target, if you have any? That's the first question. Hi Lei. I would like to answer the first question. Generally in Q3 and Q4 we expect the vehicle average selling price to remain relatively stable and for the battery pack cost, we foresee there is still some room for us to further reduce its costs. Together with other cost savings for the firm, I think generally the 10% -- over 10% target for vehicle margin and the overall margin can be achieved. But as you mentioned whether we want to further like increase our target for the gross margin? I don't think we want to do this at this moment. I think we’ll still keep like the guidance of over double-digits in the second half. Yes. Of course, we understand that there are still room for improvement in terms of the gross margin and many other aspects but we would like to follow according to our own pace, just like the last quarter we’d like to keep a more conservative attitude regarding the targets. So, the second question goes with the operating cash flow. I think that’s primarily driven by optimized working capital and I wanted to see if you or Steven could kindly provide a breakdown? Hi, Lei. This is Stan. Regarding the positive cash flow, yes, generally, there are the following reasons which drive the positive cash flow. The first is operating loss. We control at relatively lower level. And second, yes, as we mentioned, we renegotiate the credit term and also the payment methods with our suppliers. And for example, we ask the supplier to extend the credit term from 60-days to 90-days and also ask them to accept the bank modes instead of cash for the payment of the purchase.
So, the third way, William mentioned, the direct sales model and also the leading -- lead us to receive cash collections earlier than the payment to suppliers. So, generally all these reasons drive us to achieve positive cash flow in Q2. Yes. And I think the payment term is very positive signal as the supplier really has some confidence on you. That's pretty good. So, the third question and the last question. William mentioned monthly production capacity of between 4.5K to 5K units. And as Steven just cited roughly 11,000 unit car deliveries in next quarter. And why do we see a gap between the production capacity and the sales outlook? Hi, this is Steven. First, we increased our product capacity at the end of August and you know for any plant which tries to increase its product capacity, there is a ramp up period. So our production capacity in July and August is still below 4,000 units. That is a constant for our delivery in Q3. And why do we increase our product capacity to 4,500 to 5,000? That’s because, that’s the preparation for our Q4 delivery. We want to increase the production capacity is because of the strong demand in the market. Many of my friends have asked me to check whether it's possible to have their ES8 delivered early. So there's a very big ES8 order backlog right now. As I mentioned, the ES6 delivery will commence at late September this year. So we also need some time to ramp up the production of the EC6 in the front. Before we start the delivery of the EC6, we will start to accumulate orders for the EC6. So it means that in the fourth quarter of this year we are going to witness a significant pressure on our delivery and production. That's why we would like to increase our production capacity at the end of August. Then we can be fully prepared for the EC6 ramp up and the Q4 delivery. Thank you. We have our next question from line of Ming-Hsun Lee from BofA. Please go ahead. Thank you, Will, Steven and the management. Congrats on the good results. A quick question. My first is that, I think the market seems -- does not understand too much on the battery-as-a-service. So, probably I think -- probably you can take this opportunity to give more explanation on the business. So first of all, I want to know that right now how much of battery exists on your book and once you set up a new battery management -- asset management company, around how much asset you can reduce from your balance sheet? This can ease your pressure on balance sheet going forward. And also the second question is that, once BaaS business model is confirmed, then I believe you can start to open auto finance program for both vehicles as well as in the battery. So I think that the down payment for consumers will be much lower compared to the current state. So how much more new demand do you think you can create assuming battery-as-a-service? So that's my first question. Thanks for your questions. Battery-as-a-service is a very innovative business model. And it's quite difficult to validate this process. Just like I mentioned in my previous prepared remarks that we have now got the government approval and the first vehicle without the battery has already finished the validation process regarding the insurance purchase, loan application and the license plate registration. It basically means that you buy the car without the battery. And in fact, when you pay for the car, you do not need to pay the cost of the battery.
Previously, we tried to launch similar plans, but because of the restrictions with government policy, we didn't fully implement the real battery-as-a-service business model. But now, since we have already got support from the government and related policies, we believe it's the right time for us to do this.
I would like to explain a little bit about the difference. Right now if the user wants to do the financing for the battery, then it means that at the beginning of the vehicle purchase, they can pay less money, that is around RMB100,000 less, then they will have their monthly payment, but for that monthly payment they cannot get the loan. So, it means that we can use the EC6 as an example. The price is around RMB358,000. Then it means that the users can pay RMB258,000 at the beginning. But for this, they cannot get the loan from the bank because of the government policy restrictions. But if we can go with the BaaS solution, then it means that, with the new product homologation policy and the certification policy, the users can have less payment at the beginning, but they can still enjoy the loan for their monthly payment, which, just like I mentioned, they should be able to lower the down payments, as well as the monthly payment for the users. We believe that it is not going to affect our gross margin or probably it's even going to help us with the gross margin. But with this solution we should be able to help the users to lower their down payment and the monthly payment and we believe that it is going to be a very good boost to our vehicle sales.
Just like I mentioned before, we will release the detail in the third quarter. We're now at the final commercial preparation stage. A very important task for us is to prepare the setup of that battery asset management company. We are one party out of this endeavour but we're not the main stakeholder. So, it means that it's not going to affect our balance sheet. But we would like to set up this company around August. This asset company is going to own the battery assets and then lease it to the users. We believe that this is going to be a very innovative move for the whole industry and attract more parties to join this asset management company and build a virtuous cycle. Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Paul Gong from UBS. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. I remember at the earlier stage of NIO, it had planned ET7 as a sedan as well as a new plant, but they got either delayed or canceled last year. But nowadays since you have received a lot refinancing and have a much stronger balance sheet than last year, will you consider to build the second plant by yourself or/and will you consider to launch the ET7 at a certain time or would the fourth model be a different model? Can you give us a little bit color on the next model coming in the NIO Day later this year? Thanks for the question. We have kept over cadence of launching one new product every year. After we released the ET preview in the Shanghai Auto Show, we have attracted great attention from the market and users. People are looking forward to our sedan product development. What we can say now is, the next product will be a sedan, but I'd like to ask for your patience.
We have a very comprehensive and detailed planning for our product development for the coming years. In the future, we see there is a need for the second plant. But right now we have a very successful cooperation with JAC. The product we manufacture together with JAC has ranked at the top in many quality assessments conducted by the third parties. I'm very confident with our cooperation with JAC and we do have room for improvement for the production capacity in our current plant. So we do not have a immediate need kick off the second factory. But we are now working on the planning of the second factory because of our product development cadence. We don't need to say that we will build this plant by the clock. So what we need from the company's perspective is to make sure we have sufficient capacities to support our product development and deliveries. We’re now preparing sufficient capacity for the products that we're going to launch in 2022.
Another point is about the current the new JAC plant. Without significant investment, we should be able to increase the production capacity of our current plant to 150,000 units under two shifts. Thank you. We have next question from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks very much. I have one question on selling regulatory credits. You probably have seen that Tesla gets a fair amount of revenue several hundred million dollars a quarter from selling regulatory credit to non-compliant auto brands primarily in Europe. And I know that China is considering a similar credit trading system. And I'm wondering if you are having discussions with any foreign auto brands or other auto brands to prepare to sell those automotive credits in the future in China? That's my first question. Thanks for the question. This year the Chinese government launched the NEV and the -- thanks for the question. This year the government has updated their policy of the NEV and CAFC credit which they have launched in the past, which has helped us to increase the value of the credit. We’re now on other end. So, we have accumulated around 100,000 due credits last year. According to the current price in the market, we should be able to generate RMB120 million for the revenue of the credits. We're now talking to some OEMs. We plan to sell those credits in the third quarter or the fourth quarter. We believe this is going to help us with the gross margin improvement. Different from Tesla, we're not going to account for this as part of the vehicle margin. We're going to consider this as part of the gross margin.
This year, we believe we're going to accumulate around 200,000 credits, which will be sold next year with a increased pricing. Of course, the pricing will depend on the demand and the supply in the market. But we believe this is the future direction because the Chinese government would like to make sure to use their credit to replace the subsidy and encourage OEMs to produce EVs. And we believe there will be a very big market for the credit trading between different OEMs. Last year with 20,000 units, we have achieved RMB120 million revenue, which means that for each vehicle, it can generate RMB[6,000] [ph] revenue. With increased pricing, we believe this is going to benefit our gross margin in the long-term. Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the call back to our presenters for any closing remarks. Thank you Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, just contact NIO's IR team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect the lines.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, go ahead, please. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2020, Q3 earnings call. In the third quarter of 2020, NIO delivered 12,206, ES8, ES6 and EC6, representing a strong growth of 154.3% year-over-year and 18.1% quarter-over-quarter. In October 2020, we delivered 5,055 vehicles achieving another monthly delivery record.
ES6 has been the fastest selling electric SUV in China for 13 consecutive months. ES8 has reached the number one in sales this year in the premium electric SUV segment, priced above RMB400,000 in China. Our third product EC6 has started the deliveries in September. We have gained and maintained a great word of mouth reputation for our product quality and service and continuously received positive feedback from our users.
In the 2020, China new energy vehicle experienced index released by J.D. Power in September, NIO has once again ranked highest in any new vehicle quality among all brands.
After the launch of the battery as a service or product, NIO's products and the services have been increasingly accepted by more users. The new order intake in October broke the historic record and exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we're confident that the deliveries will further grow to between 16,500 and 17,000 units.
In terms of a gross profit, supported by the steadily growing quarterly deliveries, increase of higher margin products in our product mix, as well as continuous improvement on material cost and the manufacturing efficiency of a gross margin in the third quarter has continued the upward trend with the vehicle margin and overall gross margin reaching 14.5% and 12.9% respectively, surpassing of our previous expectation.
NIO's existing efficiency is getting more and more self-evident. The operating loss has further narrowed to RMB946 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing 18.4% decrease month-over-month and a 60.7% decrease year-over-year.
In addition, we have achieved the positive cash flow from operating activities for the second sequential quarter in Q3. We are confident to achieve positive operating cash flow for the full fiscal year 2020.
Next, I would like to share with you some key topics of the company. With respect to R&D, we believe that the navigate-on-pilot feature or NoP to use via FOTA in October, which has further boosted the competitiveness of NIO Pilot, over areas assistance, and received great reviews from users and the media. Through fusing the environmental data from the sensor suite with high definition maps, NoP can guide the vehicle to follow the navigation route, automatically drive from on ramp to off ramp and overtake slower cars. It can engage not only on highways, but also urban expressways with optimizations that based on specific use cases in China.
We are accelerating the development of the second-generation technology platform NP 2.0. The core of NP 2.0 is industry-leading mass production autonomous driving system. We will share more details of NT 2.0 at NIO Day 2020.
On November 6, NIO launched the 100kWh battery pack. It features is highly integrated cell to pack architecture with 37% energy density increase, which significantly expands the drive range of our product alliance. It has also adopted other advanced technologies, including thermal propagation prevention designs, all climates thermal management, and the bi-directional cloud BMS to make the battery safer and better.
The 100kWh battery pack will begin deliveries in December. Together with the launch of the 100kWh battery pack, we also provide permanent upgrades and the flexible upgrades by month or by year to users of the 70kWh battery pack.
As of today, we have successfully closed the loop for our innovative BaaS models to vehicle battery suppression, battery subscription and chargeable, swappable and upgradable battery solutions.
As for production capacity our own supply chain production capacity has already reached 5,000 units per month in September. The teams are working diligently together with other partners to further elevate our production capacity. They target to expand the overall supply chain production capacity to 7,500 units per month, in January 2021 to meet the growing user demand.
In regards of the sales and service network, NIO has opened 22 NIO Houses and 159 NIO Spaces in 106 cities and 159 power swap stations in 70 cities in China. Moreover, we're developing the second-generation power swap station with lower costs and the better experience. And our planning to deploy the second-generation swap station in the first-half of 2021.
As our user base continues to expand, the NIO user community is becoming ever more vibrant. November marks the second anniversary of the NIO user volunteer initiative. As offered November 10, 2020, there are 3,101 user volunteers from 118 cities. They take it upon themselves to promote NIO and contributed to the community as a showroom auto shows, live streaming platform, delivery centers and the NIO Day. Users trust and support have always been the biggest motivation for NIO to do more and be better.
On November 26, 2020, NIO will embrace its sixth anniversary to previous support and the team efforts, we have achieved a milestone. But we're still stuck with a rather short history. In the face of a fierce competition and intense challenges we will remain committed to making decisive investment into product and the core technologies, and offering the best service and the holistic user experience to live up to the expectations of our loyal user community.
Thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the third quarter of 2020. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earning press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB4.5 billion, or $666.6, representing an increase of 146.4% year-over-year, an increase of 21.7% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the third quarter were RMB4.27 billion or $ 628.4 million, accounting for 94% of total revenues in the quarter. It represented an increase of 146.1% year-over-year and an increase of 22.4% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was primarily due to the increase in sales of ES6 and ES8.
Other sales in the third quarter was RMB259.2 million or $48.2 million, representing an increase of 157% year-over-year, an increase of 11.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to increased revenues derived from the home chargers installed, service packaging and energy package subscribed and accessories sold, which was in line with the increased vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2020.
Cost of sales in third quarter was RMB3.94 billion or $580.3 million, representing an increase of 91.4% year-over-year, an increase of 15.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume in the third quarter of 2020.
Gross profit in third quarter of 2020 was RMB585.8 million $86.3 million, representing an increase of RMB874 million from a gross loss of RMB201.6 in third quarter of 2019, an increase of RMB282.7 million from the second quarter of 2020. The increase in gross profit was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales and increased vehicle margin.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2020 was 12.9% compared with 12.1%, in the same quarter of 2019, and 8.4% in third quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the third quarter of 2020.
More specifically, vehicle margin the third quarter of 2020 was 45% compared with negative 6.8% in the same quarter of 2019 at 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin was mainly driven by the decrease in purchase price of certain materials and lower unit manufacturing costs, particularly due to our increased production volume of ES6 and ES8 in the third quarter of 2020.
R&D expenses in third quarter were RMB590.8 million or $87 million, representing a decrease of 42.3% year-over-year, an increase of 8.4% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses year-over-year was partly attributable to part design and development costs occurred in the third quarter of 2019 for EC6 and all new ES8 launch in the fourth quarter of 2019, at the top of all cost saving efforts and improved operational efficiency in R&D functions in the fourth quarter of 2019.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter was RMB940.3 million $108.5 million, representing a decrease of 19.2% year-over-year, an increase of 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily driven by the company's overall cost saving efforts and improved operational efficiency in marketing and other supporting functions.
Loss from operations in third quarter was RMB946 million, or $139.3 million, representing a decrease of 60.7% year-over-year and increase of 18.4% quarter-over-quarter.
Share based compensation expenses in third quarter was RMB49.2 million or $7.3 million, representing a decrease of 30.1% year-over-year, an increase of 8.3% quarter-over-quarter. A decrease in share-based compensation expenses year-over-year was primarily due to less options granted driven by the decline in the number of employees, and the impact of part of the share-based compensation expenses being recognized by using the accelerated method, under which the expenses decrease gradually over the vesting period.
Net loss in the third quarter was RMB1.05 billion or $154.2 million, representing a decrease of 58.5% year-over-year, and a decrease of 11% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the third quarter was RMB1.19 billion or $175 million, representing a decrease of 53.5% year-over-year and a decrease of 1.6% quarter-over-quarter.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the third quarter were both RMB0.98 or $0.40 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB0.82 or $0.12 per ADS in the third quarter.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB22.2 billion or $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2020. Additionally, we've achieved positive cash flow from operating cash activities for the second sequential quarter.
And now for our business outlook. As William mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2020, the company expects deliveries to be between 16,500 and 17,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 100.6% to 106.7% from the same quarter of 2019, an increase of approximately 35.2% to 39.3% from the third quarter of 2020.
The company also expects the total revenues of the fourth quarter 2020 to be between RMB6.26 billion to RMB6.44 billion or between $901.8 million to $947.9 million. This would represent an increase of approximately 119.7% to $126% from the same quarter of 2019, an increase of approximately 38.3% to 42.2% from the third quarter of 2020.
This outlook reflects the company's current and the preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from the line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Hi, Will and Steven, Jade and Tim. This is Tim from Morgan Stanley. Congratulations on a strong result and thanks for taking my questions. So I've two question and we'll quickly go through them and in mandarin first.
So my first question, we saw NIO making solid operational progress this year at all fronts for example, like in the launch of EC6, BaaS and 100kWh battery pack. So looking to 2021 in addition to the fourth model launch and ongoing investment in autonomous driving, what else would be our key focuses for R&D investment? And if possible, could the management share any rough guidance regarding the overall R&D spending versus 2020?
My second question is about BaaS, battery-as-a-service. Could you please share some market feedbacks on the battery-as-a-service program? And with the launch of the 100kWh battery pack, what's our expectation of the take rate of bus services for 2021 and beyond? These are my two questions. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Regarding the R&D focuses for next year or over recent focus, just like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The NP 2.0 is the focus in terms of the core technology. The core of NP 2.0 is the industry leading mass production autonomous driving system. Of course, we also have other ongoing projects.
In terms of the vehicle models, we have already successfully launched the three SUV. For the next product that we're going to launch is going to be a sedan on the NP 2.0 platform. It means that we're going to enter the sedan market.
At the same time we are also developing other vehicle models. For example, the second new product in the pipeline is also going to be a sedan. So with the launch of the next two new products, we believe we can complete our product portfolio.
In terms of the BaaS take rate, after we announced BaaS in August, we're very happy to see the increase with the take rate every week. And in November, we can see that among all those new orders the take rate of BaaS is around 35% which is a factor and better than our previous expectations, because of a model is made to order. So this will be reflected a little bit later in offer deliveries.
We are very happy to see this BaaS take rate momentum and we believe that it is also going to improve in the future. BaaS can help us to lower the initial purchase price and [Indiscernible] the users' concerns regarding the battery's degradation and also provide a flexible upgrade services to the user. The purpose of BaaS is to convert more gasoline current users to EVs.
After the launch of a 100kWh battery pack, we believe the competitive of BaaS has been significantly enhanced. And as the users can get much better understanding about the benefits of a BaaS, we believe the take rate will increase in the future in the long run. Perfectly clear. Thank you, William, and congratulations again on your results. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the next question we have is from Ming Lee from Bank of America. You may now proceed with your question. So, my first question is regarding the margin expansion from second quarter to third quarter your gross margin increased around 5 percentage points. Could you give a rough breakdown how would you improve your gross margin? And do you also see any extra contribution from the sales of NEV credit. So that's my first question. Thank you, William. Hi Ming, this is Stanley. The vehicle margin increased in Q3 compared with Q2 mainly contributed by two factors. The first is the average selling price increased by RMB10, 000 per vehicle, mainly because the more ES8 with higher price are sold in Q3. The second is bond cost reduced by RMB7,000 per vehicle, which are contributed by the cost reduction of battery pack and also EDS.
You mentioned the revenue from NEV [ph] credit funds, we received the revenue in Q4 which total amount of RMB120 million, and we will recognize this as other revenue in Q4. So in Q3 we'll not include it in the financial results. Yes. So, that's your question about the vehicle margin.
Regarding the service revenue, I think we are continuously working on to improve the service margin to reduce the loss. So, I think the trend will be positive in future. Okay. That's it for me. Almost speaking regarding the gross margin for other service and the sales, we believe it will be further optimized as our user base continues to expand, and this is going to be reflected with the growing economics of itself.
In the Q2 and the Q3, the change is not very evident, but we are quite confident that this is going onto has a continuous optimization in the future. [Foreign Language] Hi Lee, I think your line got dropped. Sorry. The participant's line got disconnected. [Operator Instructions] I'll move on to the next one. We have Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Operator, let the management answer the question first. Sure, sir. Please go ahead. Just to recap a little bit on the question. Basically the question is about the average selling price in the fourth quarter is into that the average selling price will increase compared with the third quarter by around RMB12,000 to RMB13,000. So we would like to know whether it is driven by its effects or the 100kWh battery pack. And we also would like to know whether the battery packs what is the take rate ratio between the 100kWh battery pack and the 70kWh battery pack? In terms of the sales revenue guidance, we are delighted to clarify a little bit just like as Stanley mentioned, for the due credit to revenue, this is going to boost the revenue for the other sales. And in our guidance, we don't actually consider the increase of the average selling price as part of the target. We believe the average selling price in the fourth quarter is going to be at the similar level as the third quarter according to the orders we receive right now.
And we just started the deliveries of the 100kWh battery pack in the fourth quarter, so we believe that this is not going to have any impact on the gross margin in such a short time, but we're very confident that we continuously improve our gross margin throughout the fourth quarter. Operator, we can move on to the next question. Certainly sir. The next question is from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse, your line is now open. Actually, I just want to know what's the margin effect is in the BaaS going forward? We see a few patterns for example of BaaS adoption, 100kWh battery and some move off interest rate subsidy for the previous different battery. And it will affect us for impact a margin in the BaaS.
Second about the new products, because we've seen the two players who have benefiting likely to be lower pricing or maybe lower margin. So is there any plan for an even bigger SUV or even bigger one because, for example, maybe the name is the ES9, we've seen the peers actually running for much bigger one? So basically what's the upcoming time for even bigger products? Thank you. I will break down into the sector to further explain the costs value improvement. The first we mentioned is about the subsidy. We further reduced the subsidy to the end users into Q3 with the launch of our BaaS model. And so in Q3 there's a little bit like sector can like due to the subsidy reduction.
And second is the scale of the economy. As you can see, the production volume in Q3 is 12,000 vehicles and almost a 20 over 20 increase compared with Q2. As William mentioned we invest more to improve our production capacity in September to 5,000 units. So the manufacturing cost I think almost all the same with the second quarter.
But about the BaaS and also the 100kWh impact on I'll turn it over to William. I would like to add some points regarding the manufacturing cost and efficiency. In the long run, of course, we will further increase our manufacturing efficiency and cost. And we believe this is going to reduce gradually, but we're going to stop with the reduction at a certain point. Of course, we can see more contribution in the third quarter compared with the second quarter, but this is going to diminish in the future. But we will continue to work on optimization of the manufacturing efficiency in the cost.
For the battery-as-a-service, we will sell other cars to the users and the battery to the battery as a company on BaaS model. So it means that this is not going to affect the vehicle gross margin, but we saw the battery upgrade the service, this is going to provide some good benefits to other revenue. So in the long run, this is not going to have any significant impact on the vehicle gross margin, but it will give some incentives to other revenue.
For the due credits, we actually include this in other revenues or other sales. We have different approaches compared with Tesla, because Tesla consider the revenue after the credit in the vehicle market. But we include that in the other revenue.
For the new product planning, we have a very comprehensive product and the market entry planning. This is going to be carried out step by step. For example, we started with other flagship SUV ES6 in mid and large segment then we entered the mid-sized SUV segment with the ES6 then the Coupe SUV with the EC6. This is a very systematic approach. So the next step we're going to enter the sedan market. When electing different market segments, we need to balance the size of the segments and the volume objectives. At this moment the rich market are not going to be our focus. I think, you also mentioned the one-time factors in Q3. We did not receive significant like sales rebates from the suppliers in Q3. So I don't think we have also the material on factors. Okay. So, can you also answer me about 100kWh battery, whether that were improving your margin? Also, I think in this call, you also mentioned about 150kWh battery are coming. So did you see that margin for upside from a battery upgrade? For the 100kWh battery pack, the users can purchase the battery pack as an option which is going to improve the vehicle gross margin, but at the same time, we also provide the flexible upgrade which can contribute to the gross margin of our services and sales. These are two different stories and approaches.
After the launch of the 100kWh battery pack, we have seen some users choose to include the 100kWh battery pack as an option. And at the same time we also provide the flexible upgrade so we also have some users opt to the flexible upgrade by month or by year. We believe this is going to improve the gross margin of the company.
But in terms of the new car gross margin or new vehicle gross margin, we think it's not going to have a significant impact, but in the long run this is going to give us some boost to the gross margin after the other sales and revenues. Our logic for this approach is basically the 70kWh battery pack that can meet the daily needs of the user and if the user can make to travel for long distance then they can subscribe to the bigger batteries or the batteries with higher density or capacity. Users can choose to the facility on demand.
This is quite flexible and this is the advantage of our service. We believe this is going to contribute to the possibilities of gross margin growth in the long run and the primary pack is going to provide a very good opportunity for us to improve with the gross margins among the existing users and this is a very unique advantage of our business model.
So 100kWh battery pack or the future bigger battery pack can in the end, improve the attraction of the 70kWh battery pack, because the users of the 70kWh battery pack will have the opportunity to upgrade the battery pack on demand. They don't actually need to have the 100kWh battery pack or 150kWh battery pack right from the beginning, they can just use the 70kWh battery pack to meet their daily usage needs. Then when it made it, they can upgrade to the bigger batteries. And we believe that this is going to significantly improve the competitiveness of our 70kWh battery pack. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next one is from Edison Yu from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thanks, everyone for taking the questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the operational plan to boost the production target in January? What needs to get done to design the ground?
And then secondly, as it relates to the next-gen autonomous platform, can you talk about your latest thinking in terms of in-sourcing the chip design maybe the implications for Mobileye and their relationship and how you think about the use of LiDAR? We have always been emphasizing on the overall supply chain production capacity, not just about the production capacity of our own plant. We would like it to work together with all the supply chain partners to make sure they can support us to boost our production capacity. The users right now will need to wait for some time to pick up their parts, because of the production capacity constraint.
We are also trying to speed up the delivery to satisfy the users demand. So right now, we're working on our own firm's production capacity expansion, and also working together with the supply chain partners to improve their production capacity. We're very confident to be able to improve our production capacity to 7,500 units.
The second question is about the chipset of the NP 2.0. We understand this attracts a lot of attention in the industry and in the market. But we still need some time to disclose the specific information at the NIO Day 2020. It's still too early for us to share information.
Of course, we have already made over decision internally. We believe we should be able to provide the most advanced chipset with the best performance in the industry, and this can help us to guarantee of a leading position in the industry for the coming years.
For the LiDAR question, I would like to share some thoughts on the autonomous driving directions first. When thinking about autonomous driving, we should evaluate the two aspects. The first one is how much time we can free up for the users. This is a question of the availability or usability. The second question is, how many accidents can we prevent with autonomous driving system, this is a matter of reliability.
So we need to think about the two aspects. When we evaluated the strategy of autonomous driving, we believe LiDAR should be able to help with both aspects. This is a very simple math. But we will need to tackle the issue of cost when it comes to LiDAR and we need to balance this out resolve for product and strategy.
In the future with the improvement of cameras and compute powers, we do believe that LiDAR can play a role in some cases and the domains, because they can help us to reduce the accident rate in some corner cases. So LiDAR is a very good addition to the technology competence.
If a company could use this interest first, then they should find ways to tackle the technical issues in terms of cost and performance. Thank you. We have the next question from Nick Lai [ph]. Your line is now open. Let me translate my question very briefly. The first question is regarding the cash burn and CapEx and investment in the next one year. For instance, William just mentioned our monthly capacity can ramp up to 7,500 in January. And would that mean that in the next one year or so, we need to expand our capacity at the Shanghai plant? On top of that, how should we think about the CapEx needed to build a swap station as well as NIO Space? So the first question is about cash burn and CapEx related.
And second question on longer-term autonomous driving solution or strategy. Based on what William commented just now, is it correct to understand that, our long-term strategy is to procure chip from top vendor, but at the same time, we will do most of the offers and capability or solution in-house. Thank you. So Nick, we have got to the CapEx to improve our production capacity. Most of the CapEx will be covered by January. Of course, NIO will then very useful CapEx on our own, but they draw the revolver [ph]. Yes. And we also will have more in the expansion of sales and service network, and also the power swap station, but we will manage well with the progress. So I don't think there will be a very big, big cash burn in I think next year. So yes, that's about the question about the CapEx. Of course, for the current development of plan and the cash positions, we believe we have no need for financing in the short-term. We should be able to have sufficient resources to support the business development of the company. With respect to autonomous driving direction, our objective is to build in-house full stack capabilities for autonomous driving. Of course, we have always had this capability in our company in-house.
Recently, we have even enhanced our capabilities in terms of the algorithm and system development, starting from 2016 we have developed the NIO Pilot first regeneration by ourselves in-house. But for the first-generation NIO Pilot, chipset is closely bonded together with the algorithm.
For the second-generation NIO Pilot, we would like to make sure we can have the in-house capabilities expect in terms of the algorithm data and the system development. Thank you. Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Jeff Chung from Citigroup. Your line is now open. So my first question is about first quarter next year sales volume outlooks. Whether they can still expand Q-on-Q? Second question is about the differences between vehicle GP margin and non-vehicle GP margins growth, outlook and forecast Thank you. Thank you for your question, Jeff. It's very early to provide the guidance for the first quarter of the 2021. Of course, we need to be fully prepared in terms of the production capacity to make sure we can meet to the usage months and the order backlog. According to the current order momentum and the current backlog, we will need to have a sufficient production capacity for the first quarter for next year to meet the order backlog right now. So in our company our business model is magnitude order so we guided to focus on the labor and others.
For other companies, as they talk about the inventory levels, but we focus on the order level. We would like to control the order levels within a reasonable range, so users don't need to wait for long time to pick up their car. We would like to improve our production capacity to make sure we can control the order level within by month. It means from the order placement to the user delivery, the lead time should between three to four weeks, then we can achieve good user experience.
At this moment, we still need a long time to meet to these targets, but we will need to ramp up our production to make sure we can improve for the experience and the work quite confidently to achieve this target in the future.
The gross margin has been on the rise. In the past we have witnessed a consistent trend that is the non-vehicle gross margin is lower than the vehicle gross margin in the past few quarters. So we have the thing, both the vehicle gross margin and the non-vehicle gross margin have been increasing. Since like I had mentioned the carbon credit, the revenue will be included in the non-vehicle gross margin in the future. And so this year we can see the value of the carbon credit has become one more evidence in China.
In the coming years, going forward, we believe the carbon credit is going to contribute to the improvement of the non-vehicle gross margin. At the same time, the revenue from other services and the power swaps can also help us to narrow the operating loss. So this is going to improve together with the expansion of our user base.
Speaking about the non-vehicle gross margin is going to improve in the long run, and the battery-as-a-service, BaaS can also improve the non-vehicle gross margin. Everything is going according to the plan.
In the fourth quarter, we're going to receive the revenues the carbon credit, which is generated by the vehicles sold in 2019. In this year, because of the sells increase the carbon credit number has increased by over 2.5 times, and we believe that the price of the carbon credit will also double next year. So the overall revenue the carbon credit will be four to five times more next year compared with this year.
Now, a lot of OEMs are in discussion with us about the purchase of the carbon credit. So we believe it is a due credit system and mechanism is going to be very beneficial to the development of the EV industry. So my last two questions is about the carbon credit. Will it be impacting on our P&L next year in 4Q as well, rather than spread evenly throughout the fourth quarters? This is number one.
Number two is about the tax rate on our NoP and BaaS, right now and going forward. Thank you. The confirmation of the carbon credit revenue is quite flexible. We are not going to put the revenue confirmation in a specific quarter next year, because this depends on the specific market conditions. If we sell too early, maybe it's a little bit too cheap.
For the BaaS take rate, just like I mentioned in November, the take rate of a BaaS has reached to 35% among the new orders. Going forward, we believe this is going to further improve in the long run and the take rate of the NIO Pilot is around the 50%. After the launch of Navigate On Pilot, we believe that this is going to have a much better performance. You have the next question from the line of Nae Yi [ph] [indiscernible] Securities. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Great quarter, guys. My question first is could you please comment on your start about Tesla's made in China model Y. Will it impact your order momentum?
And secondly, could you please give us some updates on your internationalization plan? For instance, do you have a timetable for multiple steps of going global? Where could be your stock market? What kind of models are you going to introduce to international markets? And how to hire a local and competent team? Thank you for your question, Nae. Tesla has officially announced that they're going to have a local production of the model Y. We believe that this is actually good for the users, because if we have more options for the users, this can help us to accelerate the popularization of the EV in the market.
Of course, we believe the Tesla's strategy is quite different from NIO. Starting from last year, Tesla has cut their price multiple times. And they basically have the pricing strategy based on the cost. At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, their price cut has affected for about one week. But afterwards, over order intake bounced back very quickly. After this price return, they also had several rounds of price cuts the most recent one is around October, 1, the price cut is around 10%. We didn't see any specific impact on over order intake. Actually, in October, our order intake has broken the historic record and exceeded our expectations.
Our transaction price is around hundreds of thousand RMB higher than Tesla's average selling price. So we believe that this proves that we have our own unique advantages with our products and services. Model Y's introduction to the China market is going to be beneficial for the overall market. But we believe the competition is more about the competition between model Y and the model 3, because we have our own unique advantages regarding our products and services.
For the market situation, basically, we believe the pie is growing bigger, and our main competitors in this market should be the gasoline parts. The China premium market is a very big market with the volume of millions. And this gives us a great confidence that we can have a sustainable growth in the long run. This is Steven. I'll give you some high-level update of our globalization efforts. First, we have a very concrete short-term target that is we enter EV market in the second-half of 2021. At the same time, globalization team of their long-term vision for NIO, so NIO is a global brand and we'll be very patient to implement this strategy step by step.
And so we have three principles. First, we will stick to our users and the price model. We believe it's our global and universal philosophy. Second, we will repeat our premium brand positioning through our key competitors, BMW, Audi and Tesla. Third, our close end service must be localized to the European customers' needs. That's the update of our good efforts. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. That will be the last question for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information on our website. So this conclude the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. That will conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. [Foreign Language] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO’s 2020 Q4 earnings call.
[Foreign Language] In the fourth quarter of 2020, NIO delivered 17,353 ES8, ES6 and EC6, representing a strong growth of 111% year-over-year and 42% quarter-over-quarter. The accumulated deliveries of 2020 reached 43,728, representing a strong growth of 113% over 2019. We achieved a historic monthly delivery of 7,225 vehicles in January 2021 and a resilient delivery of 5,578 vehicles in February 2021, representing strong 352% and 689% year-over-year growth respectively.
[Foreign Language] In 2020, all three NIO models have achieved exceptional performance in the market. ES6 has been the best selling electric SUV in China for the full year of 2020. ES8 has reached number one in sales in 2020 in the premium electric SUV segment priced as of RMB 400,000 in China. EC6 has ranked at the top in the premium coupe SUV segment for three consecutive months in China starting from November 2020, backed by the top-notch product quality and service. NIO has gained growing positive recognition and feedback from users and the industry. In the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index published in January 2021, EC6 achieved the best safety rating among all models tested by C-IASI in 2020.
[Foreign Language] Supported by competitive product offerings, outstanding services, and innovative business models, we have won increasing user recognition and expect the overall deliveries in the first quarter of 2021 to reach 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles.
[Foreign Language] In terms of gross margin, driven by steadily increasing deliveries, stable average selling price, and improving material cost and manufacturing efficiency, our vehicle gross margin in Q4 reached 17.2%, moreover, benefited from the NIO energy credit revenue. The overall gross margin has also increased to 17.2%.
[Foreign Language] NIO has continued to achieve positive cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020. In all aspects, NIO’s operational efficiency and overall system efficiency has significantly improved in 2020.
[Foreign Language] Next, I would like to share with you some key topics of the company.
[Foreign Language] As the NIO play on January 9, 2020 or actually 2021, we launched the ET7, our the first flagship sedan based on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0, NT2, with its cross breeding dimensions, breakthrough exterior, sophisticated interior, efficient powertrain, immersive digital cockpit and industry-leading autonomous driving capabilities, ET7 has received a remarkable feedback from users, media, and the industry. Its order performance has also exceeded our expectations.
[Foreign Language] Based on NIO’s in-house full-stack autonomous driving technology platform, ET7 will be equipped with NAD, NIO Autonomous Driving, consisting of NIO Aquila Super Sensing and NIO Adam supercomputing. NIO Aquila Super Sensing system has 33 high-performance sensing units, including 11 8-megapixel high resolution cameras and one high-resolution LiDAR with a detection range of 500 meters. The computing power of NIO Adam is up to 1,016 TOPS. The sensor suite and the computing power of NAD far surpass other competitors and will expedite the mass production progress of the autonomous driving industry.
[Foreign Language] NAD will provide a safer and more relaxing AD experience from point A to point B, gradually covering highway, urban, parking, charging, swapping and other use cases to free-up time and to reduce accidents. In addition, NIO NAD will be the first AD system offered through a monthly subscription service or AD-as-a-service, so more people can try out and enjoy NIO NAD.
[Foreign Language] We have also launched the Power Swap Station 2.0 at the NIO Day, which enjoys much lower cost and 3 times higher service capacity compared with the first generation. In addition, we have launched the 150 kilowatt hour battery pack, which boasts 50% energy density improvement and can significantly extend the driving range of all NIO models. With the 150 kilowatt hour battery pack, the NEDC range of ET7 can reach over 1,000 kilometers. Under NIO’s service system, every user can shift to upgrade to different battery packs on demand.
[Foreign Language] NIO is devoted to building an innovative model of battery vehicles operation and battery subscription with chargeable, swappable, upgradable batteries as well as providing holistic power solutions to users. Along with the growing user base and expanding battery offerings, more and more users opt for battery-as-a-service, BaaS. In February 2021, the take rate of BaaS among NIO orders has reached 65%. We believe BaaS and NIO’s holistic charging and swapping service system can accelerate the conversion from ICEs to the EV.
[Foreign Language] The continuous development and research of NIO products and technologies is the cornerstone of sustainable development. NIO will decisively step-up our R&D investments and speed-up the development and production of core technologies and NIO products. In 2021, our R&D investment is expected to double and reach around RMB 5 billion.
[Foreign Language] Our production capacity has reached 7,500 units in January. Our partner JAC has already kicked-off further production capacity expansion in the Hefei plant and plans to expand the annual production capacity to 150,000 units under one shift and 300,000 units under two shifts to prepare for the production of ET7 and future products.
[Foreign Language] In February 2021, NIO entered into a further collaboration framework agreement with the Hefei government to jointly plan and build the Xinqiao Smart Electric Vehicle Industrial Park, including R&D and manufacturing, pilots demonstration and industrial supporting services, and build a world-class smart electric vehicle industry cluster with a full-fledged industry value chain.
[Foreign Language] With regards to the sales and service network, we now have 23 NIO Houses and 303 NIO Spaces, covering 121 cities in China. In light of the continued contribution of the offline spaces towards brand awareness, order growth, and user community operations, we plan to open 20 new NIO Houses and 120 new NIO Spaces in 2021 to further expand the network coverage, leverage NIO’s competitive edges of direct to sales, consolidating both online and offline traffic, as well as improve the user experience and the efficiency of the overall sales process.
[Foreign Language] NIO has built 191 swap stations in 76 cities. Starting from the second quarter of this year, we will gradually deploy the Power Swap Station 2.0, which offers better experience with lower cost. Our target in 2021 is to ramp-up to at least 500 power swap stations in total. Moreover, we will step up our efforts in building our supercharging network and destination chargers. We currently have 127 power charger stations and over 1,700 destination chargers, which will reach 600 and 15,000 respectively by the end of 2021.
[Foreign Language] While the user base grows, the operational efficiency of NIO’s after-sales service system is also improving. We now have 31 new service centers and 158 authorized service centers. To deliver better service experiences to the users, we will expand over after-sales service network to further optimize our after-sales service system.
[Foreign Language] NIO aims to build a community starting with smart EVs while we share joy and grow together with users. The live broadcast of the NIO Day 2020 held on January 9, 2021 has attracted 100 million views. At the NIO Day, we launched the Blue Point Plan and became the world’s first auto company to help users to certify emission reduction and trade carbon credits. In 2021, the second user council of the NIO User Trust has decided to focus their work this year on user care, industries of communities, public welfare and environmental protection. The constant support of our users is the constant force to drive us to always move forward.
[Foreign Language] 2020 is an important milestone on the development journey of NIO. With the users’ support and the team’s efforts, the company’s overall operations are back on-track and have entered into a rapid development stage. As a start-up, we will stay true to our original mission, continue to make decisive and efficient investments in the R&D of new products and core technologies and further expand the charging and swapping network and the after-sales service network to provide the best holistic experience to NIO users.
[Foreign Language] As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter.
Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020, and to be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the fourth quarter were RMB 6.64 billion or $1.02 billion, representing an increase of 133.2% year-over-year, an increase of 46.7% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues consist of two parts; vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 6.17 billion or $946.2 million, accounting for 93% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 130% year-over-year and increase of 44.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was primarily due to higher deliveries achieved from more product offerings and the expansion of our sales network through the continuous launch of NIO Spaces in 2020.
Other sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 467 million or $71.6 million, representing an increase of 184.1% year-over-year, an increase of 80.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to sales of automotive regulatory credits as well as the increased revenues derived from the home chargers installed and accessories sold in line with incremental vehicle sales.
Cost of sales in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.50 billion or $842.8 million, representing an increase of 77.3% year-over-year, an increase of 39.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter was RMB 1.14 billion or $175 million, representing an increase of RMB 1.40 billion from the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of RMB 556.1 million from third quarter of 2020. This increase in gross profit was mainly attributed to increased vehicle sales and increased vehicle margin.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 17.2% compared with negative 8.9% in the same quarter of 2019 and 12.9% in the third quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the fourth quarter of 2020. More specifically, vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was 17.2% compared with negative 6.0% in the same quarter of 2019 and 14.5% in the third quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle deliveries as well as a decrease in purchase price of certain production materials.
R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 829.4 million or $127.1 million, representing a decrease of 19.2% year-over-year, an increase of 40.4% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses year-over-year was caused by the decrease of R&D expenses related to the EC6, which came to mass production in September 2020, and the company’s overall cost-saving efforts and improved operational efficiency in R&D functions.
SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 1.2 billion or $185 million, representing a decrease of 21.9% year-over-year, and an increase of 28.3% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily driven by the company’s overall cost-savings efforts and improved operational efficiency.
Loss from operations in the fourth quarter was RMB 931.4 million or $142.7 million, representing a decrease of 67% year-over-year and a decrease of 1.5% quarter-over-quarter.
Share-based compensation expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 60.2 million or $9.2 million, representing an increase of 17.6% year-over-year, and an increase of 22.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in share-based compensation expenses year-over-year was primarily attributed to the incremental options granted with relatively higher grant date fair values due to the increased share price.
Net loss in the fourth quarter was RMB 1.39 billion or $212.8 million, representing a decrease of 51.5% year-over-year, and an increase of 32.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in net loss quarter-over-quarter was primarily attributed to the unrealized foreign exchange losses derived from the depreciation of US dollar cash balance held by domestic entities with functional currency of RMB in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter was RMB 1.49 billion or $228.7 million, representing a decrease of 48.4% year-over-year and an increase of 25.6% quarter-over-quarter. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the fourth quarter were both RMB 1.05 or $0.16 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB 0.93 or $0.14 per ADS.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 42.5 billion or $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we achieved positive cash flow from operating activities for the full year of 2020.
And now for this outlook, as William mentioned, for the first quarter of 2021 the comp expects deliveries to be between 20,000 to 20,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 481% to 424% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 15% to 18% to the fourth quarter of 2020.
The company also expects the total revenues in the first quarter of 2021 to be between RMB 7.38 billion and RMB 7.56 billion or between $1.13 billion and $1.16 billion. This would represent an increase of approximately 438% to 451% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 11.2% to 13.8% from the quarter of 2020. This reflects the company's current and the preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to operator to proceed our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Edison Yu from Deutsche Bank. Please ask the question. Thank you very much. So first question I wanted to ask is on NIO's focus in the premium market. It seems you're very focused on that and that's not going to change. Would you consider developing another brand to go after the mass market or more mid-tier market?
Second question is about the international expansion. You’ve indicated that you’ll enter Europe later this year. I’m wondering what kind of sales volume would you expect in the longer term. And in relation to that, there is a lot of speculation from the press lately that NIO is getting much more serious about getting to the U.S. Could you share your latest thoughts about that?
And I'll translate that.
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] Thank you, Edison for your questions. Of course, it's possible for us to enter the U.S. – to enter the mass market. The NIO brand is going to focus on the premium market. Simply speaking, NIO brand is not going to enter the mass market, but in the past few years, we have already tried different approaches to enter the mass market. For example, we established joint ventures through investments with GAC and Changan. Previously, our shareholding in those joint ventures is around – over 40% and now our shareholding has reduced to 5%. This gives us more flexibility and possibilities to try different approaches to enter the mass market. And we would like it to be more active to do this. This is going to be part of our long-term strategy.
[Foreign Language] Regarding the second question of the international markets or the global market; starting from this year, we are going to enter the Europe market. We will build our own sales and service network in the European market. Right now, we have already kicked off the preparations regarding the team setup, products and the sales and the service network building, basically covering all aspects for our operations in Europe. This is going to be part of the long-term strategy for us to enter the global market. So we need to be patient. In the long run, of course, we would like to achieve significant shares in important major markets in the global arena, but it will require a lot of effort and time to do this. Starting from day one, we have our R&D operations and other operations in different regions and countries, but we understand the sales and the service is going to be more complicated if we decide to enter different regions and countries.
Regarding the U.S. market question, we have already kicked off the research about the US market entry at a very early stage. We have started about the possible business models, strategies, and different approaches about how could we enter the U.S. market, but this will require lot of patience and we would like to do this step by step. Thank you, Edison. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America Securities. Please ask your question. Thank you. Thank you, William, and the management team. So my first question is regarding the margin improvement in fourth quarter. If I adjust the contribution from the credit sales, the gross margin of the company is around 15.7% in this quarter, still improved a lot from last quarter. So could you give us some breakdown regarding margin improvement, for example, like ASP improvement in the quarter [indiscernible] improvement in this quarter? Besides, could you also elaborate more regarding on the battery supply and also the chip supply? Recently, especially we already see the company will postpone the battery upgrade for certain customers in June. So could you elaborate more on this?
And the second question is also regarding, battery-related, because recently we already see the upstream cost inflation. So we are interested about the cost trend in 2021 and also probably some rough gross margin guidance for this year? Thank you. Thank you, Ming. Stanley will answer the first question. Yes. The vehicle gross margin increased from 14.5% in Q3 to 17.2% in Q4. It was mainly driven by more ES8 and EC6 with higher gross profit margin delivered and the material and manufacturing cost of vehicles slightly decreased. And back to numbers, I think the average selling price increase was RMB 10,000 per unit and manufacturing cost and material cost slightly decreased. And to the overall gross margin, we booked RMB 120 million EV credit sales in Q4. The overall gross profit margin contribution was 1.8%. That leads to the overall gross profit margin increase. And regarding the gross profit margin guidance in 2021, what I can say is the margin in Q1 can also be slightly improved, but the trend not so large as much as in 2020. And for the full-year guidance, I think it's too early for us to give at this moment.
For the battery and chip supply, we can go back to William. Okay. Thank you, Stanley.
[Foreign Language] Thank you for your questions. Regarding the chip supply and the battery supply, of course, this has a very big impact on the overall supply chain. This is also one of the constraints for us in the second quarter of this year. Of course, right now, we have sufficient chip supply to support the normal production, but it’s a changing time, so the situation will evolve gradually.
For the second quarter of this year, we will still have some risks regarding the chip supply, but starting from last year, our team has already kicked off the communication and the collaboration with our supply chain partners to secure the sourcing of the chip. We even have some direct communications with the chip suppliers to make sure we have sufficient supplies of the chipsets. We believe for the second quarter, we should have the chip supply to meet our basic demand, but the risk is still quite high.
Regarding the battery supply, this is another constraint for our second quarter performance. We do have some limited supplies regarding the 100 kilowatt hour battery pack and other battery packs, which is actually less than our demand because right now the market is actually quite booming. And starting from July, we believe the battery supply should go back to the normal level and meet our demand. So because of the constraints of the battery supply and the chipset supply, our production capacity will kind of be limited in the second quarter to around 7,500.
[Foreign Language] For the battery cell cost, we believe the impact on us is not that big. For this year, the cost of the battery will further reduce to some extent, but we believe it’s not going to be on a large scale, but the impact on us is quite limited, because we have already locked the supply with our battery partners. We’re still very important – probably the most important customer for CATL. So we have a very good pricing with CATL's batteries. Thank you, Ming. Your next question comes from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please ask the question. Thank you. I have just one question [indiscernible] EV sales because actually recently, we got different picture. For example, your peer Li Auto have a pretty weak guidance. However, today's guidance seems to be a surprise on the upside, especially the March has been reached a new high for NIO. We're also facing competition from Tesla Model Y [indiscernible] what's happening in the near-term EV demand is still [indiscernible]. So seems like it's confusing. And meanwhile, you seem to be quite positive about second quarter, you guide about 7,500 per month. Is that your guidance for second quarter? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Bin, for your question. Normally speaking, the first quarter of the year is the low season for the EV industry because of the subsidy and other policies.
[Foreign Language] Model Y has announced their pricing for the locally manufactured vehicle, but this is the normal strategy and practice of Tesla. Normally, they cut the price and then they can boost the order backlog. Our approach is quite different from Tesla because we would like to make sure we have a stable order performance instead of these ups and downs in the order backlog. For us, we don't actually want to cut the price to boost the order backlog. So it's quite different from Tesla.
We would like to focus on the service and the experience improvement as well as building a positive word of mouth reputation in the market because we do not want to cut the price. Because of our strategy, we can achieve a very stable and solid pricing with our products, which will also help with our gross margin and the vehicle gross margin. Just like I mentioned, in February, the BaaS take rate among the new orders has reached 55% and is growing every month. So with our unique competitive edges and our long-term capabilities, we believe we should be able to secure a strong footing in the market instead of being affected by those short-term strategies and practices.
[Foreign Language] Your next question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please ask the question. Good morning, management team. Congratulations on your strong results and good guidance. So I have two questions. The first question is about the vehicle sales this year because since our next model, ET7 won't kick-start deliveries till next year, how can NIO meaningfully grow the vehicle sales in 2021? And will there be any spec upgrades or major model facelift on top of the aggressive channel expansion plan and BaaS program?
My second question is about your comments on the NIO House. Because I remember, like last time you mentioned NIO House might be less cost efficient. So could you elaborate more about the key consideration when deciding to resume the deployment of NIO House? And what would be the overall investment and additional operating expenses to scale-up the coverage of the NIO House based on the current estimate? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Tim, for your question. We will start the delivery of the ET7 from the first quarter of 2022. This means we will have a lot of preparations to do before the actual launch, especially in terms of autonomous driving technologies. We will need to do sufficient testing and development work for the autonomous driving technologies. Starting from now to the delivery of ET7, we will mainly rely on three current products, including ES8, ES6 and EC6 for the sales performance.
Regarding the EC6, it’s actually launched around September 2020 and for the all-new ES8 is launched around March 2020. So for the ES6, it started the delivery from the second half of 2019. So in terms of the product life cycle, we believe all the three models are quite competitive in the market compared with the gasoline cars and other EVs. We believe before the launch of the NT 2.0, we do not need to have significant changes and facelift to our current three products. But on the other hand, we would like to further expand our sales and service network.
China is a very big market. So we will still have a lot of opportunities. If we can further improve our infrastructure building, this can also help us to improve our sales performance. Starting from this year to next year, before the launch of the NT 2.0, we will mainly focus on the sales and service network and experience improvement to improve our sales performance. So we are quite confident this should be able to help us to achieve our sales target.
At the same time, we also have battery-as-a-service and the 100 kilowatt battery pack delivery. This is going to contribute to the conversion from ICE to the EVs. We’re witnessing the trend is accelerating from this conversion. We believe our main competitors are the gasoline cars at the same pricing level that is around RMB 300,000 to RMB 400,000. So in 2022, as you can see, Audi, BMW and Mercedes have achieved sales new highs. So it means that this is actually a very big market. We believe our products are actually much better than their products. So it means that we have a lot of opportunities. We also do not have a very aggressive sales target because we’re not going to sell hundreds of thousand vehicles in one year. So we believe with our current sales target, we should have the confidence to achieve the objective.
[Foreign Language] Hi, Tim. I would like to elaborate the reasons why we bring NIO House back and the cost efficiency of our NIO House. I would like to remind you on the three key functions of the NIO House. First, it help us to convert leads to orders and speed-up the deployment, will enhance the brand awareness, increase our user touch points. And second, NIO House also represents a very strong brand presence; increased investment into brand communication will be conducive to the long-term benefits of our brand. Third, NIO House is also very important for our user system and for our user community. And also, on other hand, we have accumulated rich experience in operating offline stores and better control the [indiscernible] planning and cost, which significantly lowers the investment and operating cost per store. To give you a rough number, the average store investment is just 40% of the original and the average rent and operating cost is just half of the original. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, William. Your next question comes from Nick Lai from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Yes. Hi, good morning. It's Nick from JPMorgan. Great results. Congratulations indeed. So two simple questions. First on NIO autonomous driving solution. Yes, you mentioned that for the NIO ET7 model, which will be equipped with Adam supercomputing solution and Aquila Super Sensing capability, I wonder whether these two solutions will be used for other existing models such as EC – ES6, EC6 and ES8? And if so, how soon can we see this happening in the future? And related to this question is, yeah, is it fair to say that will broaden our monetization strategy beyond basic battery-as-a-service and to a more and more AD-as-a-service in the future?
And the second question is related to volume. You just mentioned that 2Q monthly capacity or potential volume will be somewhere above 7,500, but at the same time, you also mentioned that JAC is expanding capacity to 150,000 unit capacity on a single-shift basis. So as we move into second half of the year and hopefully the supply bottleneck on battery and chip can be solved, and how should we think about capacity – or monthly production increase into second half? And also related to volume question, you just mentioned the ET7 backlog order is beyond – is well above expectation. What does that mean? Does that mean 20,000, 30,000 units or anything – any guidance would be appreciated? Thanks. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Nick, for your question. ET7 is the first model built on top of the NT 2.0. Of course, all future models will be developed based on the new technology platform 2.0, but we’re not going to kick-off this work as soon as possible, but it’s already in the pipeline. For other products and the future models, we will leverage the latest technologies and we will share with – more information with everyone regarding the product planning and the product portfolio at the right time.
[Foreign Language] For the AD-as-a-service, we believe this is the right direction because we believe in the future or the AD as a Service should be provided through the subscription model, because it's going to benefit the users. And from the technology point of view, it's also quite reasonable and feasible compared with the ADaaS business model, the AD as a Service business model is based on the installed base. So in these studies when users' life cycle is 15 years then within these 15 years, we should be able to generate the revenue based on the AD as a Service business model.
In this regard, we believe the AD as a Service business model is much better than the traditional ADaaS business model. If you look at the cloud service business like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other domestic players in China, we believe that this AD as a service subscription model is going to be a very good revenue stream, but that is why we are going to be quite decisive to promote this business model and the subscription model. And from the Battery as a Service, we have already learned a lot of experience and competence, and we believe this means that users should be quite acceptable regarding the AD as a Service.
[Foreign Language] For the AD as a Service in a nutshell, we believe that take rate is going to be higher and they can generate revenue throughout the user life cycle. It's all going to be beneficial for the users and we believe it's also going to be a very good business model and it's going to be quite sustainable.
[Foreign Language] I would like to provide more information regarding the production capacity. We have already achieved 7,500 units production capacity in January. I would like to explain a little bit about the overall supply chain production capacity concept, because this covers both over own plant and the supply chain production capacity.
During the spring festival, the Hefei plant has already kicked off their production capacity ramp up. And so, we now have the capability to produce 10,000 units per month by having two shifts in some workshops. However just like I mentioned because of the constraints of the chipsets, supply and the battery supply, in the second quarter, we may only be able to secure an overall supply chain production capacity of 7,500 units per month. But starting from July, we expected to elevate the overall supply chain production capacity. And just like I mentioned before our partner JAC has already kicked off their further production capacity expansion. So it means that probably the annual production capacity is going to reach 150,000 units under one shift and 300,000 units under two shifts by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.
[Foreign Language] Another question is about the ET7 order performance. Actually, ET7 was available for orders on the NIO Day. On January 9, 2021, the ET7 order backlog performance has exceeded all other models we have right now, but we cannot disclose the specific information regarding the order backlog. We would like to just to focus on the delivery performance, but overall speaking regarding the pricing of the ET7 is around the RMB 448,000. With this kind of our pricing we believed that ET7 has performed very well in terms of accumulating sufficient orders. Thank you, Nick. Thank you William. Your next question comes from Lei Wang from CICC. Please ask the question. Good morning. This is Wang Lei speaking from CICC. I would say that's a very strong earnings report and a very strong first quarter guidance. I have one follow-up question about the joint venture of BaaS. William just mentioned 55% of the take rate. Could you please inform what is the capital status of the joint venture and how many batteries this company can support theoretically? Thanks. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Lei, for your question. Regarding the battery assets management company, we have already finished two rounds of for financing. Right now, we have eight shareholders including NIO. We have already raised around RMB 4.4 billion. Right now, many new investors have approached to me and asked whether it's possible for them to invest in the battery assets management company. At the same time, we also secured sufficient credit facilities from the bank for the battery asset management company. As a very important player or a very important role in the Battery as a Service business model, the battery asset company has already procured a sufficient cash to support this business model operation.
[Foreign Language] But in terms of the penetration rates of the batteries, amount of Battery as a Service users, the delivery is going to be later compare with the orders because we have a make-to-order business models. So, first, we have a penetration rate in the order backlog, and then this will be gradually reflected in the delivery of the batteries through the vehicle - to the users.
[Foreign Language] Thanks, William. The next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. Please ask the question. Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one is relative to on the near-term sales. Do you foresee the lower tier cities are increasingly to be the key focus for your expansion? And how do you think about your expansion of network and your ideal mix of the sales into tier one, tier two versus tier three cities? And do you foresee to gradually moving from tier one focused into lower tier cities in the next 12 months?
The second question is regarding the autonomous driving system development for the ET7 obviously you have put a value redundant a very powerful hardware on the vehicle. And for those who choose not to subscribe the AD system will still put the same hardware on the vehicle, or will you choose to upgrade for the later stage when they choose to subscribe to that. And if you put such kind of redundant hardware does that mean the costs tend to be higher and your strategic sector lower margin on the car sales than try to monetize it through the subscription, the later surveys in the later life of the stage of the whole vehicle. Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Paul, for your question. In fact we have always been quite aggressive in building and expanding our sales networks. Just like I mentioned, we have already got NIO houses and NIO spaces in around the 12 cities. And starting from last year, we have accelerated the expansion of the NIO spaces. In 2021, we're going to do new 20 NIO houses and 120 new NIO spaces. Our basic strategy of principle is to build our point of sales in those cities that has dealerships of the BMW, Audi and Mercedes or Lexus. Based on this principle, we haven't achieved full coverage yet in those cities, but we believe with our average this year we should be able to achieve a full coverage. And for our existing NIO houses and NIO spaces, we already got some in the tier three and tier four cities.
[Foreign Language] We do not have any specific tactics regarding where should we have the NIO houses or NIO spaces. It's more driven by the sales performance. For example, in the Yangtze River delta region the sales performance is quite good. That is why we decided to do the NIO houses and the NIO spaces in this region. So overall speaking, we would like to expense our sales network coverage in more cities and in more areas.
[Foreign Language] But we would like to build more charging and swapping network in the remote places or remote cities, especially including the supercharger network and the destination chargers. For example we would like to deploy our charging and swapping network in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang and other remote cities. In those other cities, they do not have very good infrastructure for the EV. Starting from this year, we're going to ramp up our infrastructure in those places. Our principle and our vision has always been that the EV users can go everywhere with a very good user experience. So we would like to focus on those cities because right now the cities do not have a very high EV penetration. That is why no third parties would like to build the infrastructure in those cities, but we would like to start this work first.
[Foreign Language] Regarding the AD as a Service and ET7, the hardware including NIO Aquila Super Sensing and NIO Adam Super Computing, all come as a standard that ET7, but we're not going to lower our vehicle gross margin just because we are now using the AD as a Service subscription model. We would like to still keep a reasonable vehicle gross margin at the time of the sales. Previously, we have already said that around 20% is a reasonable vehicle gross margin target, so we are not going to lower this target. For the NAD, we believe that this is going to make a long-term contribution to our overall gross margin and the vehicle gross margin. Thank you, Paul. Thank you everyone. Your next question comes from Jeff Chung from Citi. Please ask your question. [Foreign Language] So I’ve got three questions. And what is the NOP and BaaS attach rate in the past, right now and in the future? And how sensitivity does it relate to the GP margin and earnings? The second question is a range estimate of full year’s sales volume target. Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Jeff, for your question. Just like we mentioned before, the take rate of BaaS among the NIO orders in February is around 55%. Regarding the NIO Pilot, we have two different packages. One is the full package and another one is the selected package. So the blended take rate of the NIO Pilot with these two packages is around 50%. We believe for some users, they would like to choose to install or activate the NIO Pilot after the vehicle purchase. So this is also going to help us to increase the take rate of the NIO Pilot, but different people have different preferences. We think this is going to increase to some extent, but it’s not going to be a very significant jump. For the Battery-as-a-Service, this is not going to have a significant impact of our gross margin, so the impact, I think, is going to be quite minimum.
The NOP is going to contribute to our gross margin and it's going to be beneficial to the overall gross margin. If the take rate increase of the NOP is one of the reasons that we have improved our gross margin, the full package of the NOP is priced RMB 39,000. So this is going to be a very good contribution to the gross margin. Starting from this year, we're going to focus on expanding to the installed base because right now we have already got 88,000 users, so half of them haven’t opted for NOP yet. So we would like to provide some innovative models, plans for those users. For example, we have tried some financing models for the NOP or NIO Pilot to the users and received a very good result. For the after-sales installation of the NOP or activation of the NOP, this is going to contribute to the overall gross margin instead of the vehicle gross margin.
Another question is about the overall supply chain. For the first half of this year, we would like to be more conservative and prepare our production based on the 7,500 units, like I mentioned, but for the second half of this year, we are quite confident about the demand, but we do not have the full visibility yet. We will further expand our sales and service network as well as our charging and swapping network. We believe that this can help us to improve the sales performance and this is going to help us to achieve a much higher sales in the coming second half of this year. Thank you, Jeff. Our final question comes from Fei Fang from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. Congratulations on the strong performance. Just a quick question about your power swap station build-out. How do you strategize your footprint? How do you choose location? How often do you assume consumers will be using the infrastructure on a per vehicle basis? And then long-term, how do you think about sort of the right size for your power swap network given the strong BaaS adoption? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Fei, for your question. Regarding the power swap, we actually provide services directly to the users and we can have the information regarding the users with – whether they can install the home chargers or what should be their routine routes, what is the distribution of our user base. So based on all those information and our make-to-order business model, we should be able to have a very good planning for the battery swap locations. Based on the location information of the users, we can make the optimal choices regarding where should we deploy the power swap stations. We can also have the information regarding how – what should be the highways that are frequently visited by our users, so we can deploy the power swap stations in those highways.
Overall speaking, the efficiency of our battery swapping stations and the planning accuracy of the battery swap stations have significantly improved compared with the past. After the deployment of the battery swap stations, we have also accelerated the speed of the service providing or the service offering to the users and achieved a very good performance. For example, during the peak hours, the battery swap stations can achieve around 10,000 battery swaps. Right now in China, we believe the long-term trend is many users will not be able to install the home chargers. Although our installation rate of the home chargers is already quite high among the peers, but as our user base grows, we can see that this trend is going to gradually go down.
So it means that we would like to provide a more holistic power solution to the users, including the home chargers, the power swap stations and other services and the battery swapping shows that it can better support this part of the users’ demand. Together with our Battery-as-a-Service, the battery swapping technology, battery swap stations and the third-party charging infrastructures, we believe we can provide the best holistic battery – best holistic power solutions and experiences to the users. Thank you, Fang Fei. As there are no further questions, now I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO’s Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call.

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO’s 2021 Q1 earnings call.
[Foreign Language]
In the first quarter of 2021, NIO delivered 20,060 ES8, ES6, and EC6, representing a strong year-over-year growth of 422.7%, and a solid quarter-over-quarter growth of 15.6%. All three models have achieved outstanding results in their respective segments, especially EC6. With its comprehensive performance, streamlined silhouette, and the superior digital experience, EC6 has outperformed other peers in the coupe SUV segment and has been well received among users, especially among the younger audience.
[Foreign Language]
On April 7, 2021, over 100,000 production vehicle was rolled off the line. It took NIO 26 months to roll off the first 50,000 vehicles but only nine months for the second 50,000. Together with our users, NIO has set a new speed record from delivering the first vehicle to the 100,000 vehicle among the premium auto brands.
[Foreign Language]
Driven by the growing brand awareness, competitive product portfolio, industry-leading technologies, outstanding services, and innovative business models, NIO has gained increasing recognition and support from our users. Our order momentum remains solid, while the risk of a global chip shortage still looms large in the second quarter. Despite the challenges, we expect to deliver 20,000 to 22,000 vehicles in the second quarter.
[Foreign Language]
In terms of the gross margin benefited from higher deliveries and solid average selling price. Other vehicle gross margin reached 21.2%, while the overall gross margin increased to 19.5% in the first quarter.
[Foreign Language]
On top of the positive operating cash flow for the full year of 2020, we have continued to realize positive cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2021, while steadily improving operating efficiency and overall system efficiency. We remain committed to doubling down on our investments in research and development and stayed determined to accelerate the deployment of our swapping and charging network and off-line service channels.
[Foreign Language]
Next, I would like to share with you some recent key operational highlights of the company.
[Foreign Language]
After the launch of ET7, our first flagship smart electric sedan at the NIO Day, it has attracted great attention from the market and the industry. Our teams are fully focused on and devoted to the production and testing of ET7. On April 2, the first body-in-white of ET7 rolled off the production line in Hefei Manufacturing Centre. On April 19, the interior of ET7 was unveiled at the Shanghai Auto Show, showcasing its second living room design concept, which has been well received by the media and the public.
[Foreign Language]
On April 15, we kicked off the deployment of the Power Swap Station 2.0, the second-generation Power Swap Station can significantly boost its service capacity to up to 312 swaps per day by shortening the battery swapping time and carrying up to 13 battery packs. To further improve the swapping experience, we upgraded and optimized all the NIO Pilot based on the Power Swap Station 2.0 in NIO OS 2.10.0, which was released to users in April, to achieve an automatic, one-click, park-and-swap experience without getting out of the car throughout the whole swapping process. All new users can enjoy this feature once they have updated their vehicle operating system. As an organic part of NIO’s holistic charging and swapping network, the Power Swap Station 2.0 will be gradually deployed nationwide in China.
[Foreign Language]
NIO has created innovative battery subscription model based on vehicle battery separation and chargeable, swappable and upgradeable battery. As more users get to know better about the benefits of the Battery as a Service or BaaS and more battery pack options become available, BaaS has gained increasing popularity. We believe BaaS and NIO’s growing charging and swapping network will further elevate the user experience of owning an electric vehicle and attract more users to choose electric vehicles.
In addition, since its launch, the 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack has been widely welcomed by our users with a much higher take rate than we expected. As of April 16, more than 10,000 users have been using the 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack. On April 18, we have also officially made the flexible upgrade to 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack available for reservation and will offer this upgrade service to users starting from June.
[Foreign Language]
In terms of a production capacity at late March and early April, due to the semiconductor supply shortfall, JAC-NIO factory halted the production for five working days, which has posted certain negative impacts on our production and delivery in April. In the second quarter, we expect the challenges to the overall supply chain production capacity will continue to linger. In spite of the volatile microenvironment, we are working closely and diligently with our partners to secure supply chain resources. During the production suspension period and holidays, our partners and us have modified our production lines to prepare for the mass production of ET7.
[Foreign Language]
Not long ago, NIO signed further collaboration framework agreement with the Hefei government and announced to jointly build the NeoPark, a smart electric vehicle industrial park in Xinqiao. On April 29, 2021, NIO participated in the kickoff ceremony of the NeoPark and organized the NIO Partner Conference 2021 in Hefei. NIO strives to collaborate with partners in talent attraction and cultivation, research and development, supply chain, and manufacturing to facilitate the development of the smart electric vehicle in Hefei.
[Foreign Language]
To further support the production of NIO’s future models, together with our partners, we will plan and build a new factory in NeoPark. We are in discussion with our partners about the detailed execution plan and the Cooperation Model, and we’ll share more information at an appropriate time.
[Foreign Language]
With regards to the sales and service network, we now have 23 NIO Houses and 211 NIO Spaces, covering 123 cities in China. We’ll continue to strengthen the building of the NIO Houses and the NIO Spaces to further expand the sales network coverage, improve operational efficiency and enhance brand influence.
[Foreign Language]
NIO has built 206 swap stations in 77 cities. We have gradually started the deployment of Power Swap Station 2.0. We aim to have at least 500 battery swap stations in operation by the end of this year. At the same time, we will ramp up the availability of Power Chargers, our supercharging piles, and the destination chargers. Up until now, we have deployed over 146 Power Charger stations and 1,826 destination chargers and plan to increase it to 600 and 15,000 respectively by the end of 2021.
[Foreign Language]
On April 15, NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Sinopec to work together on building battery charging and swapping infrastructure. This strategic collaboration will enhance efficiency of site selection for NIO’s charging and swapping facilities, better users experience of owning an EV, and help convert more gasoline car users to EV.
[Foreign Language]
In the meantime, to provide users in the Northern China region better and more convenient charging and swapping services, we announced the Power North Plan at this year’s Shanghai Auto Show in the next three years in the eight northern provinces and autonomous regions. We plan to deploy 100 Power Swap Stations, 120 Power Mobiles, 500 Power Charger stations with over 2,000 Power Chargers, and 10,000 destination chargers. We believe that Power North Plan will significantly improve the electric vehicle usage experiences for users in the north and further catalyze the adoption of smart electric vehicles in those areas.
[Foreign Language]
Up to now, we have 33 NIO service centers and 162 authorized service centers in operation. Coupled with continuously improving operational efficiency, we will keep expanding our after-sales service network and to further improve the service operation system.
[Foreign Language]
As a user enterprise, the trust and the support of our users has always been our most treasured resources and the driving force of our growth. At the just concluded Shanghai Auto Show, 180 user volunteers from different cities came to our group to introduce the concept, product, technology, and service of NIO to others. Fifteen NIO users collaborated with experts from various industries to jointly host 14 sessions of a brief talk to discuss how to shape a joyful lifestyle with smart technologies. Many users displayed their original artworks at the NIO user museum at our Auto Show booth through which they shared the joyful lifestyle NIO advocates and shapes.
[Foreign Language]
With the support from our users and the efforts of our teams in 2020, NIO has stepped on to the right track for the overall operation and has embarked onto the stage of accelerated development. The year of 2021 is of key importance for NIO’s development. We will further improve the establishment of power sales and service networks to enhance NIO’s brand reputation and provide the best holistic experience to NIO users. More importantly, we’ll continue our decisive and efficient investments in new products and technology research and development to solidify the foundation for NIO’s long-term growth.
[Foreign Language]
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2021. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenues in the first quarter were RMB7.98 billion or US$1.22 billion, representing an increase of 481.8% year-over-year, an increase of 20.2% quarter-over-quarter.
Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sale in the first quarter was RMB7.41 billion or US$1.13 billion, accounting for 93% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 489.8% year-over-year, an increase of 20% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher deliveries achieved from more product mix offered to our users, the expansion of our sales network since 2020, and the slowdown of vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic in China.
The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to higher deliveries and higher average in price. Other sales in the first quarter were RMB576.5 million or US$88 million, representing an increase of 395.3% year-over-year, an increase of 23.4% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was in line with the incremental vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the increased revenues derived from 100-kilowatt-hour battery permanent upgrade service provided since December 2020, partially offset by sales of automotive regulatory credits in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Cost of sales in the first quarter was RMB6.43 billion or US$0.98 billion, representing an increase of 317.5% year-over-year, an increase of 16.9% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales was in line with revenue growth, which was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle delivery volume in the first quarter of 2021. Gross profit in the first quarter was RMB1.55 billion or US$0.24 billion, representing an increase of RMB1.72 billion for a gross loss of RMB0.17 billion in the same quarter of 2020, an increase of 36.2% from the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in gross profit was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales and increased vehicle margin.
Gross margin in the first quarter was 19.5% compared with negative 12.2% in the same quarter of 2020 and 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase of gross margin was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin in the first quarter 2021. More specifically, vehicle margin first quarter was 21.2%, compared to negative 7.4% in the same quarter of 2020 and 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase of the vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle delivery volume, higher average selling price, as well as lower material costs.
The increase of vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to higher take rate of NIO Pilot and 100-kilowatt-hour battery package. R&D expenses in the first quarter were RMB686.5 million or US$104.8 million, representing increase of 31.4% year-over-year and a decrease of 17.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase of R&D expenses year-over-year was mainly attributed to less R&D, research and development activities in the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic in China. The decrease in R&D expenses quarter-over-quarter reflected fluctuations due to different design and development stages with new products and core technologies.
SG&A expenses in the first quarter were RMB1.2 billion or US$0.18 billion, representing an increase of 41.1% year-over-year and a decrease of 0.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily to the increased marketing activities, as well as increased number of employees in sales and service functions in the first quarter of 2021. SG&A expenses remained relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Loss from operations in first quarter was RMB295.9 million or US$45.2 million, representing a decrease of 81.2% year-over-year and a decrease of 68.2% quarter-over-quarter.
Share-based compensation expenses in the first quarter were RMB96.5 million or US$14.7 million, representing increase of 198.1% year-over-year, an increase of 60.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily attributed to incremental options granted to relatively higher grant date fair values during the period.
Net loss in the first quarter was RMB451 million or US$68.8 million, representing a decrease of 73.3% year-on-year and a decrease of 67.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders in the first quarter was RMB4.88 billion or US$0.74 billion, representing an increase of 183% year-over-year, an increase of 226.7% quarter-over-quarter.
In the first quarter of 2021, NIO purchased 3.305% equity interests in NIO China from the minority strategic investors and recorded an amount of RMB4.4 billion or US$0.67 billion in accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interest to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders was RMB354.5 million or US$54.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the first quarter were both RMB3.14 or US$0.48 per ADS.
Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB0.23 or US$0.04 per ADS. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments was RMB47.5 billion or US$7.3 billion as of March 31, 2021.
Additionally, we achieved further cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2021. And now, for our business outlook. As William mentioned, for the second quarter of 2021, the company expects deliveries to be 21,000 and 22,000 vehicles, representing increase of approximately 103% to 113% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 5% to 10% from the first quarter of 2021.
The company also expects the total revenues of the second quarter 2021 to be between RMB8.15 billion and RMB8.50 billion or between US$1.24 billion and US$1.30 billion. This will represent increase of approximately 119% to 128.7% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 2.1% to 6.5% from the first quarter of 2021. This business outlook reflects the company’s current and preliminary view on the business situation and the market condition, which is subject to change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Lai. Please ask your question. Yes. Good morning, William, Steven, and management team. Congratulations for the great results. My simple two questions, first one is on gross margin and second one is really on chip shortage come across by many investors. On gross margin, indeed, a very good improvement of – from 4Q last year to 1Q this year. The vehicle margin increased from roughly 17% to 21%. And of that 4 percentage point improvement, I wonder if you could help us quantify a little bit the underlying driver, how much percentage is driven by ASP volume and on the flip side, raw material, price, batteries, and so on.
[Foreign Language]
That’s my first question. And second question on the chip shortage, it’s a common issue. And I know this probably is very low two to three months. And at the same time, we did revise down cycling our 2Q sales volume guidance from previously, William mentioned 7,500 per month in 2Q. And right now, it’s roughly about 21,000 to 22,000 in 2Q. And on the chip shortage, do we have any visibility on the potential easing of supply? Would that happen hopefully in 3Q?
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] Hi Nick, this is Stanley. Overall, our vehicle costs, including BOM and also manufacture cost, remained stable in Q1 2021. And the increase of vehicle margin are mainly driven by the increase of take rate of 100-kilowatt battery pack and also the NIO Pilot, of which 5,000 is for the 100-kilowatt battery pack, and 8,000 is for the NIO Pilot take rate. So the overall 100 battery pack take rate in Q1 is 25. And we think these trends will keep in the following quarters. So that’s the general reason of why we achieved a higher gross profit margin in Q1. Okay. William? [Foreign Language]
Overall speaking, the gross margin in the first quarter of 2021 is higher than our expectation. Just like Stanley mentioned, this is mainly driven by the higher take rate of some options by the 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack and the NIO Pilot. At the same time, the cost has also reduced to some extent. We believe the current gross margins around 20% is a very healthy situation for the company’s operations, because we don’t actually cut the price and we believe this is quite comfortable for us.
But at the same time, I would like to urge everyone to manage your expectations because this kind of rapid improvement of the gross margin will be quite challenging for us. But I believe there will still be room for improvement for the gross margin, but not at this big margin. So we should not be too optimistic about the gross margin improvement. But we believe, right now is quite good for us to reach 20% of the gross margin, and it’s earlier than we expected. Still, our focus for the company is the product and the service.
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] The second question is about the chip shortage. The current situation in the market is quite volatile. And we have been tracking the chip supply every day. This has been a very severe issue for the whole industry supply chain. For example, the fire incident of one factory has caused several days delays for the chip shortage. And we believe this negative impact is going to kick in around the middle of May, and this is going to affect the whole industry supply chain. We believe this kind of incident will happen from time to time. That is why we believe the challenge for the whole industry will still be quite big for the following quarters or months.
At the beginning of April and at the end of March, we suspended the production of a factory for five working days, which is going to impact our delivery and production in April. For the full quarter, we believe that it will be possible, but still quite challenging for us to achieve 7,000 to 7,500 production units. We are trying our best to secure the supply and to maintain the production speed. Of course, we are quite confident, but the challenge is still quite daunting.
This is a common situation for the whole industry. The common understanding in the industry is the turning point will happen around the third quarter and the overall situation is going to improve around the fourth quarter. But some pessimistic – some also believe that probably this situation is going to continue to next year. Our supply chain partners have shown very strong support to the production of NIO. Yesterday, we had our partner conference in Hefei, which was attended by hundreds of partners to show their support of NIO’s production. And we believe the situation is quite challenging. But overall speaking, overall operation is relatively okay. Thank you, Nick. Our next question comes from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Thank you so much. Actually, I got two questions. Number one is about – I found that you have an announcement about ESG. Can you elaborate what’s the detail and why you host another ESG maybe for the first time? That’s number one question. Sorry. The second question about the margin outlook. Actually, I found that a few factors may be impacting the second quarter. One is the NIO Pilot attach rate.
Second is the – was the penetration of about the 100-kilowatt-hour pack. Number three, I found that you offer a free insurance auto finance. Number four, maybe in the semiconductor pricing hike because not just the supply, but also – on the pricing also increase. Notably, lastly, it’s about the battery price. Can you provide guidance about dilution about the margin and the other key parts and movements? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thanks for your questions. At this morning, we announced that we are going to organize an EGM. There are some important points in this EGM that we’re going to discuss. The first one is we are going to increase the number of the directors in the board. Right now, our board member is five people, and we would like to increase this number because we want to improve the diversity and the flexibility of the board. At the same time, another important matter is we would like to give the user trust the right to nominate directors to the board. But this is a nomination right, it’s not an appointment right. So the Board will still have the power to appoint the directors.
At the IPO of the company, I have transferred one-third of my shares to establish this user trust. And the user trust focus is on environmental protection, the industry subcommittees, the social welfare, and the user care. We believe it’s quite important for us to allow the user trust to participate in the decision-making process of the company, which is a very important strategy for the company. That is why we would like to propose this in the EGM.
From this proposal, we believe it’s going to be quite beneficial for the long-term development of the company and it’s going to serve the best interest of our shareholders. This also showcase our mission of building a – and the vision of building a user enterprise, which will also help us to deepen our relationship with the users for the long run.
[Foreign Language] Okay. Hi Wang Bin, as explained by William in the prior questions and 20% gross profit margin is quite healthy at the current stage for us. So we don’t expect the margin will dramatically improve in this year, like quarter-on-quarter in 2020. But the 100-kilowatt battery pack and also the NIO Pilot features are both well accepted by our users. And we expect these two like options will further bring the high profit margin for us, yes. That’s the general trend we want to explain to you, yes. Okay. Thank you. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the result. So two questions from my side. The first question is about competition because as you may notice that a lot of traditional players launched their models during Auto Show this year. So if you look at the product pricing channel strategy, I think they are quick learners and catching up rapidly. Meanwhile, several tech names or smartphone makers also announced their EV plans. So I think William has shared a lot of initiatives during the quarters now. But what will really make NIO to be, say, differentiated in the following years? Are we going to change our pricing or product strategy in mid to long-term? So that’s my first question.
And second question is about the launch of ET7 because as William just mentioned, I think the supply dynamics stay tight and might stay challenged throughout the whole year. Considering like the more back-loaded second half, do you see any risk that the launch of ET7 might be delayed or face any production bottleneck, especially I think ET7 carries quite a lot of new hardware and software features? Where could be the potential bottleneck in your view? So, thank you. [Foreign Language]
In this year’s Shanghai Auto Show, we have witnessed the vitality of the China smart EV industry. If you have ever visited the Shanghai Auto Show this year, you should have seen this by yourself. That is we have a lot of innovations in the smart electric vehicle industry in China.
[Foreign Language]
Okay. In terms of the overall competitiveness, NIO is still quite confident in our specific market segments. In the premium market, we haven’t seen any brand with this kind of competitiveness yet in terms of the product, the service, technology, user experience, and user community.
[Foreign Language]
For the traditional brands, yes, there has been some highlights for their premium brands and premium products. But still, I believe they’re still lagging behind in terms of the digital experience and the autonomous driving capabilities. So it will be quite important for them to be more decisive and determined to transform themselves into this new era of smart electric vehicle.
[Foreign Language]
Of course, there have been many domestic players following NIO in terms of the technology adoption, user community contact, and direct services to users. They have been moving very fast as followers. But I believe it will be quite challenging and difficult for them to build a premium brand, and they will face significant pressure in terms of their pricing. Of course, the auto market is not a winner-takes-all market.
But our focus at this moment is still in the premium market. In this market, we can see that the EV still accounts a small share compared with that of the gasoline cars. Although in March, the EV penetration has reached 10%, but the majority of the vehicles in the market are still gasoline cars. So it means that we still have a lot of room and opportunities for growth.
[Foreign Language]
When it comes to the long-term differentiation, we believe in the auto industry, it’s quite important that you should not have any very significant and obvious weaknesses. With our comprehensive competitiveness in product technology, service, user operations, and the user community, we believe that we can solidify our position in the market with all those strengths and stood out in the competition, this differentiator and the competitiveness is going to continue to grow and stay strong in the long run.
[Foreign Language]
This is a marathon. This is not a sprint. So we’re quite confident in our long-term competition.
[Foreign Language]
The second question is about the mass production of ET7. ET7 will be the first product on our second-generation platform, NIO Technology Platform 2.0. So it means that this is not just about the production of ET7, it’s actually about the mass production of the second-generation platform. We are the first in many aspects.
For example, the advanced sensors, the computing power, SoC chipset, and other advanced technology applications. Some companies have launched their product with some kind of like 1.5-generation technology or transitional technology, which is not going to be our strategy because we would like to just leap forward to the next-generation technology and achieve significant technology breakthroughs. Of course, this kind of determination is going to raise a lot of challenges for us. For example, we have to pull ahead the production schedule of many advanced technologies like the LiDAR and the NVIDIA Orin SoC.
This has posed a lot of pressure on our teams and the partners. But we are still quite confident that we believe it’s possible for us to launch ET7 according to schedule in the first quarter of next year. Our teams and our partners are fully focused on achieving this goal and to pushing ahead despite all those challenges. Our objective is to make sure we can deliver the product according to our quality requirement and solve the production bottleneck.
So we can gradually ramp up the production and the delivery of our vehicles to the users. So as the history tells us that NIO has very strong capabilities to deliver one new product every year. And our quality has already been proven that we are at the top. So that’s why we are quite confident that we should be able to deliver ET7 according to the schedule with high quality. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ming-Hsun Lee from BofA Securities. Please ask your question. Thank you. Thank you, William and team, and congrats for the good results. So my first question is regarding the details of NeoPark. So from the announcement that we saw that NeoPark, ultimately, it will reach 1 million-unit capacity.
So I want to understand that – probably your near-term plan for this NeoPark. Is 1 million capacity all for NIO? Or probably will have other EV companies? And also, for this NeoPark cooperation, will the current cooperation method continue? JAC built a plant and hire laborers, but NIO will purchase the equipment and the mold, et cetera. So that’s my question.
And the second question is regarding the battery form factor. So we are seeing more and more auto companies start to apply LFP battery to further control the cost, lower the selling price, and to increase the penetration rate. From the recent media, we also saw that NIO will probably consider to use LFP battery by the end of the year. So could you give us more update regarding the potential plan? Thank you, William and management. [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question, Ming. Yesterday is quite important because Hefei government has kicked off the building of the NeoPark. But over here, I would like to emphasize the spelling of this park is N-E-O, it’s not N-I-O. The Chinese name of this industrial park is Xinqiao or the literal translation is new bridge. This bears the same name with the Hefei Airport. This is a very big park, occupies a huge area.
[Foreign Language]
It is around 11.3 kilometer – square meters.
[Foreign Language]
This industrial park will be a massive project including manufacturing facilities, R&D and residential areas, as well as culture areas. NIO is going to be a very important company in this park. But according to the planning of the Hefei government, they will also have probably hundreds of other companies joining this NeoPark.
[Foreign Language]
For the planning of the Hefei government regarding the NeoPark, NIO is not going to invest on the infrastructure building of the park. Hefei government is going to make this investment. But NIO is going to be a very important company using this park. Just now you asked about the capacity of the 1 million units and the 100-gigawatt hour whether this is only for NIO or whether this is going to be available for other companies.
Of course, if NIO is going to develop in a very fast speed, then I believe that the Hefei government is not going to make this matter very complicated for NIO and themselves. Then it means that NIO should be able to use all the resources and the capacities, and all the infrastructure built by the Hefei government in the NeoPark. But this is the planning of the NeoPark, which may be different from the actual execution in the future, we need to look at this step by step. NIO is going to be a very important player in this NeoPark.
And this NeoPark is also going to contribute to the long-term development of NIO because we believe if we can attract all the talent and consolidate all the resources in this NeoPark, it will be beneficial for NIO’s development. Just like what happened in Anting in our Shanghai headquarter. NIO is the – NIO was the first company or innovative company to build the offices in the Shanghai headquarter in Anting. And then many other companies followed suit to join in this offices area in Anting.
So we believe if we can consolidate all the resources together with other partners in this NeoPark, this is also going to help us to improve the operational efficiency, including our internal efficiency. Because if you imagine that we have all the people working in the same place, including our manufacturing teams, R&D teams and they are also living in the same place, this is going to help us to significantly improve the operational efficiency of the company.
[Foreign Language]
Then the next important factor we should consider is the external operational efficiency. If according to the current planning of the NeoPark, we will have the battery factory together with the vehicle factory, then it means that after we finish the production of the battery packs, we can ship directly to the vehicle factory in a very short distance. And that’s the same with the seat factory in the future. So it means that we can save significant logistic cost.
For example, the battery logistic cost is around US$100 per battery pack. So imagine in the future, the volume is going to be 100 – or is it going to be 1 million units, then this is going to be a huge saving in terms of the logistic cost, and this is also going to help us to improve the overall operational efficiency.
[Foreign Language]
When it comes to the operation model of the – cooperation model of the second factory, we will continue to focus on the manufacturing corporation. It means that we will still focus on the manufacturing processes, technologies, the quality, and the operations of the – of our plant. And we will invest in some dedicated equipment for NIO, but we are not going to invest on building the actual factories. In terms of the operators in the second factory, this will be managed by the joint venture between JAC and NIO, the name is Jianglai. And this joint venture is going to be responsible for the overall operation and management of the operators in the plant.
[Foreign Language]
The next question is about the LFP battery pack. Yes, many companies, including Tesla, are using the LFP battery pack. Of course, there are some inherent advantages of the LFP battery pack. A very important one is the cost. But there are also some weaknesses and shortcomings with this technology or form factor. For example, the performance of the battery pack in low temperature. This is going to significantly affect the user experience, especially during the winter. If we can solve the performance bottleneck under low temperature, I believe it should be the right timing and the right choice for us to use LFP battery pack and form factor. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Lei Wang from CICC. Please ask your question. Good morning. This is Wang, Lei speaking. I would say this is beyond our expectation to see the vehicle margin above 20%, so definitely congratulations to the team. I think most of my question has been properly answered. I only have one follow-up question regarding the collaborations with Sinopec group on swap stations. So will Sinopec burden some of the CapEx investments in the second-generation service stations? Or will Sinopec share some of the revenues as well? So I’ll translate my question.
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question. Of course, in the future, we’re going to deepen the cooperation with Sinopec. But for now, our cooperation is quite simple. Basically, we utilize their sites and the location resources. In the gas stations, of course, they will need to have a service personnel, so we believe this is also an opportunity for us to work together to share the service resources. But at this moment, we do not have any revenue-sharing mechanisms between NIO and the Sinopec. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Edison Yu from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Two questions from the competitive angle, sort of. First, coming out of the Shanghai Auto Show, we obviously saw a lot of product, a lot of developments. Has this influenced or sped up your target about bringing in a mass-market brand into the market – I’m sorry, non-NIO brand? Is that effort kind of been accelerated? Or any sort of change to those kind of plans for going forward? And then second question, it seems like a lot of automakers now also potentially considering doing chips themselves. I think it’s reported that NIO has considered doing that as well. What’s your latest thinking on kind of moving away from NVIDIA and doing the chips yourself as well or designing the chips yourself? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
So thank you for your question, Edison. From the competition perspective, I checked out all the possible competitors and their new models. So to be honest, the most impressive one is from Wuling Hongguang, they’re a sub-brand in Beijing. They have a model called PV EV. For the mass market, we believe there are many new companies launching their new products. Just like I mentioned, in the China smart EV industry, the innovation capability has been quite strong. So we are quite confident about the popularization and the adoption of the smart EVs in the future. But in the premium sector right now, we don’t actually see any strong competitors.
[Foreign Language]
The second question is about the research and development of the chipset. In the smart electric vehicle industry, we believe that the industry chain is going to move toward chipset software and other smart technologies. For the long-term, the top leaders is going to deepen their investments in research and development of the smart powers, I believe this is the common outstanding of the industry. At this moment, we do not have any specific plans that we can disclose to the public or share with the public. But I believe it is quite obvious to everyone that NIO has always been very decisive in investing in the research and development of new technologies. We are determined to build our full-stack capabilities surrounding the smart electric vehicle technologies, including autonomous driving, and we believe that this is going to build the long-term competitiveness of the company. Thank you. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Gong from UBS. Please ask your question. Yeah. Thanks, William, and thanks, everyone. Two questions. The first one is on the R&D and second one, a bit of a follow-up on the gross margin. On the R&D, I see in this quarter, it’s actually a pretty moderate even sequentially declined from the 4Q at less than CNY700 million. I recall last time you said you’re going to double down on the R&D activity in 2021 and significantly increase on the budget. So can you give us a little bit like an update on this strategy? And more importantly, which key areas is going to be the focus for the R&D? Any rough breakdown how much percentage goes to the vehicle development? What percentage goes to the maybe autonomous driving, et cetera? This is my first question.
My second question is a little bit follow-up on the gross margin. Obviously, this is pretty decent gross margin for a relatively young company like NIO. But in between of this margin versus market share, is it – I think it’s like overly focused on the margin and a little bit like under-focused on the market share. Do you think – will you strategically choose to – either adding higher specs or kind of making the vehicle more competitive in the market to balance in between of this margin versus market share?
And also, how do you think about, say, rising material cost impacts in the next few quarters? Because some battery makers have indeed mentioned that it’s possible for the battery price to go up. I think I caught your comments just now that the 100-kilowatt hours of the battery take about 25% in Q1. What was the NIO Pilot take rate in Q1, please? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question, Paul. Regarding the R&D expenses, yes, the R&D expenses in the first quarter is not that high. But this follows the normal pace and the development stages of a vehicle. For example, right now, our ET7 is still under research and development.
Then, it means that starting from the second quarter, we’re going to see an increase in R&D expenses related with the testing cost and the ETD cost together with our suppliers. The ET7 R&D expenses will increase gradually as they get closer to the mass production. At the same time, we’re also developing multiple products in our pipeline because we would like to make sure we can apply the NG 2.0 Technology to more products in different segments in faster speeds. So starting from the first – second quarter, we are going to see some ramp-up of the R&D expenses.
This will be mainly driven by the research and development of other products in the pipeline. Just like you mentioned, we are determined to develop the autonomous driving full-stack capabilities, the software capabilities, and the smart electric vehicle technologies. We will accelerate the development of the NIO Technology Platform 2.0 and the NIO Technology Platform 3.0. At the same time, we’re also ramping up of R&D personnel.
In the past first quarter, the R&D personnel in the company has significantly increased, and we believe this will continue to increase in the following quarters. We have also increased our investments in terms of the R&D resources in the platform technologies, including EDS or the electric powertrain. In this year, it will be quite challenging for us to efficiently and effectively spend the RMB5 billion for the R&D expenses, but we are quite confident that we can achieve our objective and improve our R&D capabilities at a very efficient manner.
[Foreign Language]
The second question is about the balance between gross margin and the market share. Of course, for any company, if we want to have a sustainable operations and development, we need to maintain a reasonable gross margin. So the current gross margin, yes, it’s better than our expectation. But we have emphasized again and again that we’re not going to cut the price, and we would like to leverage our margin to invest more on user service including the power infrastructures and also the user community.
For the market share, I believe that we need to look at the market share in different market segments. For example, it’s not possible for us to compare the market share of a Ferrari and a Porsche in their market segments with the market share of a Wuling Hongguang in the mass market segment. So for NIO, our focus is the market share of the premium market. We don’t want to have the same strategy like other brands that just cut their price from time to time because we believe this is going to hurt the brand image and the users. For example, Porsche probably only sells around 300,000 units, but they contribute 40% of the gross margin of the Volkswagen – net profit of the Volkswagen Group.
So we believe if we want to build our market share in the premium segment, we need to devote more resources and energy to manage the brand and the user community. Our focus is not going to increase – or to cut the price of our product and then to increase the market share because even if you cut the price of the product, probably, in the end, you still cannot improve the market share. So we believe after we reach a reasonable margin, then we can use this margin to improve our product, our services, and the infrastructure that’s for our users.
So this will be of a long-term strategy. In the global premium market right now, the market volume is around CNY10 million, and we only accounted for a very small share. So it means that there’s still a huge room for us to grow in the future. For the mass markets, this will be a different story. And the entry of the mass market will acquire – will require a different strategy. But what I can say right now with 100% certainty is we’re not going to use a NIO brand to enter the mass market. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Zhang from Daiwa. Please ask your question. Hello. Actually, it’s Kelvin from Daiwa. So I have two questions about company. So first of all, I want to know, I noticed that you have kind of a Norway – launching in Norway conference next week. So I want to know would there be any other overseas expansion plan that you can share with us? This is the first question. The second question is that can I know how – because what we know is that the raw material costs and also auto trip costs are all increasing. Do we expect like a month-on-month or even week-on-week increase affecting your component price? What’s the trend? Or how fast is this accelerated? Thank you. Kelvin, this is Steven. Sure. First, Norway is our first stop for our long-term globalization strategy. But for the May 6 conference call, we will still focus on the Norwegian market. Just for information, actually, in March, we already set up our national sales company in Norway, and we also have already built up a local team, who will take charge of our local operation and service. And in end, actually, we already selected the location for our NIO House in Oslo. And for more details about the Norwegian market, please do join our May 6 media conference to get more details. Thank you. The raw materials, we expect there will be some increase in the coming quarters. But compared with the overall selling price, I think the cost can be well controlled and also have a big impact to our gross profit margin, yes. [Foreign Language]
On one hand, we have some routine cost reductions. On the other hand, there are some cost increases, especially in terms of the chipset recently. But overall speaking, the saving is bigger than the cost increases. So we believe that the bill for material cost will continue to go down. Next question. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please ask your question. Hi, William and Steven. Good quarter and guide year. I just had a question on the longer term. When you look on your partnership with Sinopec, how do you expect them to roll out their stations? I know you have a 500-battery swap station target, but any thoughts on how Sinopec would be rolling out their 5,000 battery swap stations? Thanks. [Foreign Language]
Thank you, Vijay, for your questions. Yes, Sinopec announced that they will build 5,000 swap and charging facilities in their gas stations. But NIO is not the only partner working together with Sinopec. And they are not just only going to build the swap stations in the gas stations, they will also do the charging facilities. Of course, we hope to deploy more charging and the swapping facilities from NIO in the gas stations. But at the same time, we also have many other partners, both locally and nationally. So we believe the site resources will not be a big issue for us. And also, on the solid-state battery road map – on your own solid-state battery road map, can you give us an update when do you see that in production or tests? That’s it. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Overall speaking, the current process and the testing and the production of the solid-state battery is on track. Thank you. Moderator, we need to conclude our conference call today. It has been attended. And big thanks for all the great questions asked by the analysts. Operator? Operator, we would like to conclude today’s conference call. Certainly. As there are no further questions now, I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact the NIO’s Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's second quarter 2021 earnings call.
[Foreign Language]
In the second quarter of 2021, NIO delivered 21,896 ES8s, ES6s and EC6s. A new quarterly record, representing a strong increase of 111.9% year-over-year. In July, NIO delivered 7,931 vehicles representing a strong 124.5% growth from last year. All three models have achieved a solid performance in the premium SUV market.
[Foreign Language]
According to the data published by China Passenger Car Association, in the first half of 2021, the penetration rate of battery electric vehicles has reached 8.4% in China. NIO's penetration in the Tier 1 and the Tier 2 cities in China has been growing at a much faster pace. In Shanghai, the first half of this year has witnessed our penetration in the premium SUV segment, reaching 13.7% among all ICE and the electric vehicles. Our monthly order intake keeps it growing, but the delivery volume will be determined by the overall capacity of the supply chain. We expect the total delivery in the third quarter to be between 23,000 and 25,000 vehicles.
[Foreign Language]
In terms of our gross margins, we have achieved a steady performance with vehicle gross margin and overall gross margin standing at 20.3% and 18.6%, respectively.
[Foreign Language]
Next, I would like to share with you some recent operational highlights of the company.
[Foreign Language]
Since the first validation build of ET7 rolled off the production line in May, a series of rigorous test of vehicle functionality, performance and homologation have been kicked off. We are very confident with the on-time delivery of ET7 next year. Meanwhile, the development of NAD, next new generation autonomous driving system is also advancing smoothly. We believe that NAD will deliver the best experience of autonomous driving and lead the charge of autonomous driving technology development in the industry.
[Foreign Language]
In 2022, we plan to deliver three new products based on NIO Technology Platform 2.0, including ET7. Our teams are devoting every effort to press forward the development of the new products.
[Foreign Language]
In the meantime, we are also confidently optimizing and upgrading the NIO Technology Platform 1.0 to strengthen the competitiveness of our current three models. In late August, we will release the NIO OS 3.0, which will go out with a fresh new look of UI [indiscernible] design, new features and further optimization of the existing functions. There continues over-the-air update, the functionality and experience of NIO Pilot have also been improved. As a result, more and more users have chosen and enjoyed NIO Pilot. In the second quarter, the take rate of NIO Pilot exceeded 80%. As of July, NIO Pilot has been engaged for a total of over 200 million kilometers.
[Foreign Language]
In terms of production capacity, despite the semiconductor supply volatilities in the second quarter with joint efforts of the teams and other partners, the production and the delivery have met our expectations in the quarter. Since July, the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events have posed a series of challenges to the global supply chain. The most recent COVID situation in certain regions in China have already affected our production. We will continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to minimize the impact on the production and the delivery in the third quarter.
[Foreign Language]
With regards to the sales and service network, we now have 25 new houses and 243 new spaces in 128 cities in China. But we will continue to deploy our new houses and new spaces, improve operational efficiency and quality and expand sales network coverage to quickly build our presence in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. As of now, we have set up 36 new service centers and 171 authorized service centers in 133 cities. We will further increase the number of service centers to meet the rapidly growing user service demand.
[Foreign Language]
Up until now, we have deployed 361 swap stations in 103 cities and completed over 3 million battery swaps for the users. In July, we announced NIO Power's battery-swap station deployment plan by 2025. We plan to increase the total number of battery-swap stations to over 700 by the end of 2021 and to over 4,000 globally by the end of 2025.
[Foreign Language]
On the other hand, we're also expanding over power charging and destination charging network. As of now, we have established over 238 power charging stations and installed 2,416 destination charges in China.
[Foreign Language]
With the accelerated deployment of the charging and swapping network, and deepening understanding of fast when more people can truly experience and recognize the benefits of the battery swapping and fast, which has attracted more users to choose Battery as a Service.
[Foreign Language]
On the front of the global market, the Norway market entry has been progressing as planned. The first batch of ES8 has been shipped and expected to arrive in Norway in mid or late August to be ready for the preorder and delivery in September. Starting from September, NIO Apps, NIO Life, NIO House, NIO Power chargeable, swappable and upgradable service system, NIO service center and the delivery center will gradually become available to users in Norway.
[Foreign Language]
As a user enterprise, our users are playing an increasingly important role in the NIO community. The preparation for NIO Day 2021 has been kicked off with the active participation of our users. Pseudo out of 10 candidate cities has been voted to be the host city of this year's NIO Day.
[Foreign Language]
Our user community has also joined us in making a positive difference in the world. In July, the City of Zhengzhou and a few places in Hunan Province were hit by heavy rainfalls and floods. NIO dispatched service resources nationwide to support users in Hunan, provided real-time usable charging power information to both NIO users and users of other EV brands and supported the disaster response and relief work with donation and the special purpose fund of NIO Users Trust.
[Foreign Language]
2021 is a critical year for NIO to lay a solid foundation for its long-term development. Going forward into the second half of 2021, we will accelerate the pace of new products and full stack technology development, enhance our charging and swapping network as well as sales and the service network to be fully prepared for the delivery of the three new models in 2022.
[Foreign Language]
At the same time, we have also stepped up our mass market entry preparation. We'll enter the mass market with a new brand. The quoting of the new brand has been assembled, marking the first step of the strategic initiative of NIO.
[Foreign Language]
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the second quarter of 2020. And to be mindful of the lens of school or encourage business to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the second quarter were RMB 8.45 billion or $1.31 billion, representing an increase of 127.2% year-over-year, an increase of 5.8% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the second quarter were RMB 7.91 billion or $1.23 billion, accounting for 94% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 110% year-over-year, an increase of 6.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher delivery achieved from more product mix offered to our users. The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to higher deliveries.
Other sales in the second quarter were RMB 536.2 million or $83.1 million, representing an increase of 103.3% year-over-year and a decrease of 7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was in line with the incremental vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the net revenues derived from 1 hour battery upgrade service. Cost of sales in the second quarter was RMB 6.87 billion or $1.6 billion representing increase of 11.8% year-over-year, an increase of 6.9% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales was in line with revenue growth, which was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle delivered volume in the second quarter of 2021.
Gross profit in the second quarter was RMB 1.57 billion or $0.24 billion, representing an increase of 42.7% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of 1.2% from the first quarter of 2020. The increase in the gross profit was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales. Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.6% compared with 8.4% in the same quarter of 2020 and 19.5% in the first quarter of BRL 320. The increase of gross margin compared to the second quarter of 2020 was manned by the increase of vehicle margin in the second quarter of cantina. Gross margin remained relatively stable compared to the first quarter of tea.
More specifically, vehicle margin in the second quarter was 20.3% compared with 9.7% in the same quarter of 2020 and 21.2% in the first quarter of 2020. The increase of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle volume higher over selling price as well as lower material costs. Vehicle margin remained retile stable quarter-over-quarter.
R&D expenses in the second quarter were RMB 823.7 million or $136.9 million, representing base of 62.1% year-over-year, an increase of 28.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase of recent year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies as well as to increase the number of employees in research and development functions.
As G&A expenses in the second quarter were RMB 1.5 billion or $0.23 billion, representing an increase of 59.9% year-over-year, an increase of 25.1% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily due to the increased market exerts as well as the increased number of employees in sales and service functions. The increase in SG&A expenses quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the increased marketing and promotional activities and professional subsets.
Last, for operations. The second quarter was $763.3 million or $118.2 million, representing a decrease of 34.2% year-over-year, an increase of 158% quarter-over-quarter. Share-based compensation expenses in the second quarter were RMB 2514 million or $38.9 million, representing increase of 455% year-over-year, an increase of 16.5% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily attributed to additional options and restricted shares granted.
Net loss in the second quarter was RMB 587.2 million or $90.9 million representing a decrease of 50.1% year-over-year and an increase of 30.2% quarter-over-quarter.
Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the second quarter was RMB 659.3 million or $102.1 million representing a decrease of 45.4% year-over-year and a decrease of 86.5% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter of 2021.
Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the second quarter were both RMB 0.42 or $0.07 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB 0.21 or $0.03 per ADS.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 48.3 billion or $7.5 billion as of June 30, 2021.
And now for our business outlook. As William mentioned for the third quarter of 2021, the company expects deliveries to be between 23,000 and 25,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 88.4% to 104.8% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 5% to 14.2% from the second quarter of 2021.
The company also expects the total revenues of the third quarter of 2021 to be between RMB 8.91 billion and RMB 9.63 billion, representing an increase of approximately 96.9% to 112.8% from the same quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 5.5% to 14% from the second quarter of 2021. This business outlook reflects the company's current and the preliminary view on the business on the disdain and market condition, which is started to change.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to precede our Q&A station. Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Tim, your line is now open. Hi William, Steven and team. Congratulations on the result and thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick questions for me. First question is about the new models. Could you please elaborate a little more about the two new models scheduled for 2022? About the ET7 regarding the timing, spec, rough price, a rough price range et cetera. As mostly previously anticipated to have just one new model next year. So I think this service is upside surprise. So any colors would be highly appreciated. So that's the first question. And my second question is - with NIO's total battery consumption is likely reaching 16 gigawatt or 18-gigawatt hour next year will there be any major changes to NIO's battery sourcing strategy. Will CATL stay as the sole supplier or NIO might consider looking for a second source. And in light of such a close tied up with CATL between NIO for both EV and the battery asset management company, can NIO diversify to other partners to hedge their risk if needed. Those are my two questions. Thank you.
[Foreign Language] I believe everybody knows that the NIO Technology 2.0 is going to be first applied to ET7. The current development progress of ET7 and [ph] 80 is on track and we are quite confident about the on-time delivery of ET7 next year, although the challenges is quite significant. For the other two products, I believe probably it's better for me to share more information at a more appropriate time.
Regarding the pricing of course in recent years the battery cars has declined a little bit. And as our volume goes up our BOM cost will also have some opportunity to go down. So, for the next year's product, we probably will have one of the lowest pricing products under the NIO brand, but as I explained before we are going to have a NIO brand for the mass market, so under the NIO brand we're not going to have many no-pricing products.
[Foreign Language]
Next year we believe the demand for the battery capacity is going to go up significantly especially considering the new product lineup. We believe the batter production capacity demand is going to jump significantly compared with this year we are having intense discussions with [ph] CATL regarding the battery capacity supply. Currently we believe [ph] CATL is a very good and important partner for us and we also have a very good relationship with [ph] CATL we have very in-depth discussions regarding the battery technology as well as the battery production assurance.
as well as the battery production assurance. So we believe that this current strategy can serve the best interest of the company at the current stage of development. Feng, William, thank you. All right, very clear.
[Foreign Language] Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Ming Hsun Lee from BofA Securities. Ming, your line is now open. Thank you. Good morning, William. Stephen and the team, congrats for the good results. So I have a two questions. The first question is regarding the component supply. We know you already have more large-size battery supply starting in June. But right now, consider the pandemic in China and also overseas countries such as Malaysia, so what kind of impact do you expect on the productions that especially for your component supply capacity? So it my question, first question.
And the second question is - is regarding your business in overseas markets. So in your third quarter of voting guidance, how many units do you expect to - to ship in Norway? And will you start to provide better service in overseas markets? Yeah, that's my two question. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Yes. The pandemic situation is affecting the global supply chain. Last year I believe the other supply chain partners and NIO have been trained significantly to cope with these kind of challenges. In my prepared remarks I have also mentioned over the recent COVID situations in certain regions in China have affected other production. Specifically is a just-in-time component partner located in Nanjing's high-risk area. This partner has already suspended their production. And we have seen some good news is coming out of Nanjing. Things that the COVID cases in Nanjing has already dropped to zero.
So we hope this partner can resume their production as soon as possible. The third quarter delivery volume will mainly be determined by the overall capacity of the supply chain. So there will be a lot of challenges that we need to deal with. For example you also mentioned about the pandemic situation in Malaysia. This has also affected the semiconductor supply to the global market, not just for NIO but also many other companies. But the pandemic situation in Malaysia basically we believe that the impact of for us is not that big and that it should be under control. Another situation is the flood in Germany. Our partner is also affected in the flooding because one factory is flooded during the extreme weather event in Germany and other partners have been working with us to identify the solution.
Right now we believe that the situation is under control. So of our - about speaking the - the delivery volume in the third quarter will - meaning to be restrained by the overall capacity of the supply chain.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding the delivery in Norway, we believe for this year, the contribution is not going to be that significant because all of our priority is to make sure we can ensure high user satisfaction in the Norway market by building of our brand, expanding of our sales and the service network. For the global market, we believe that the more important thing is to focus on the long-term thinking, and we were delighted to ask everyone's patience in this regard. Recently, we have been working together with - of our prospective users in Norway to set up a user advisory as they has helped us - they have helped us significantly and provided many constructive and good feedback to us. So we believe this is a very good beginning for us. And this is part of our long-term strategy for the global market.
[Foreign Language]
And of course. Global market. We also all for our BaaS model because we believe BaaS offer user a very holistic and combined together in a very efficient way for users to get their cars charged at home and on the go.
[Foreign Language]
According to the preliminary feedback we got from the Norway User Advisory Board, it seems that everyone is quite excited about the battery swapping stations and the Battery as a Service business model. Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Nick Lai from JPMorgan. Nick, your line is now open. Yes. Thank you, William and Steven. Indeed I have two number-related questions, the first one is related to gross profit margin. Yeah, I mean 2Q against 1Q roughly margin was flat but still at the vehicle level [indiscernible] margin, it was still down roughly above 1 percentage point, yeah, can you help us understand or explain a little bit more on the margin - let's say margin [indiscernible] in 2Q, it's not related to bond or implement in material price or other fact. I mean I noted in the second quarter ASP is slightly down from 1Q, I mean yeah and how should we think about 3Q, so that one is of margin-related question. Can you help us understand a bit more - or explain a bit more on 2Q margin dynamic against 1Q and how should we think about that as we enter third quarter?
And the second question related - also related to number is look at the cash on balance sheet altogether cash equivalent and short investment by the end of first half we have RMB 48 billion cash that's profit about $7.5 billion and that's a lot of cash on balance sheet. If you can help us understand what our cash [indiscernible] our strategy using the cash on balance sheet in terms of CapEx investment. I notice [indiscernible] has new capacity expansion and presumably we are launching more model in 2022. We'll need to invest in R&D new model tooling altogether. So if you can help us understand a bit more on our capital investment in the next one year or so that'll be very useful. Thank you. Hi, Nick. Hi, Nick. This is Stanley. Regarding your first quick question about the gross profit margin, there are two reasons that we put brick on into details. The first is average selling price decreased about RMB 8,000 per vehicle in Q2. The main reason is more. ES6 were sold in Q2 compared with Q1. Since yes this - it's is a little bit lower gross profit margin and selling price. But due to our continued efforts in Q2 the average vehicle cost also decreased about RMB 3,000 per vehicles. So combine the two factors together our like net gross profit margin per vehicle decreased about RMB 5,000. Okay. That's a reason for the weaker margin. And you know we announced - today we announced like three new brand-new products we will deliver in 2022. And we also refreshed our product plan and for the because relative perspective, we like to shorten our like the depreciation and amortization period for our existing products. So that will lead to the increase. So, for the second half year of 2021 the - this impact to gross profit margin will be like 2% per vehicle. So yeah, that's the first question.
And the second one is regarding the cash balance. As you mentioned we - the cash balance at the end of Q2 is RMB 48 billion. As we mentioned we will still focus on the research and development of our new product technology. So and about the other usage we will like also increase our CapEx investments including our new plant and new sales and marketing network infrastructure in the coming years. So the - it will be in line with our business plan in the next years. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Can you remind us what our CapEx target for the year? Do you have any number or guidance please? Yeah. We expect the total CapEx in this year will be RMB 5 billion. Including like the new plants and also the service and sales network and also a power substation. Yeah. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Nick. Yeah. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Bin your line is now open. Okay. Thank you so much. My first one is more a follow-up about our gross margin because you actually guided NIO pilot has been increased quite substantially in the attach rate to 80%. What's the number in the first quarter and what's the margin increase from increasing NIO pilot take rate? That is the number one question.
Number two is about your long-term market share because, you know, your peers actually want - peers actually have now 10% market share and the other one 20%. And what's the NIO's plan for 2025 for the market share, because you - we have a - a mass market brand. Can we assume that the mass market brand will start to sell in 2023, because with your three products since that the oath came from NIO brand and is - because you are looking stead right in the R&D, this is not going to be 2023. That is the second one.
And the third one is about your data of - of lifestyle expansion brand. If you see your peers, who actually get involved in strategic operation with the big data groups such as [indiscernible] existing part on the phone dealer space, this will be buyback by NIOs. So using this in the long term, may be NIO will [indiscernible] party patterns for NIO space. [indiscernible] what's your long-term strategy about offline store expansion plan. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Yeah. Since - yeah. So regarding the margin contribution for the NIO Pilot, as we mentioned, the take rate of NIO Pilot has reached 80%. For this 80%, it includes both the selected pack and the full pack for the NIO Pilot. So we believe that of all contributions from the NIO Pilot is around 3% to 4%. Yeah, these NIO Pilots - the price of NIO Pilots included in the selling price of vehicles. So we have like no like the separate gross profit margin calculation for - for the NIO pilots, yeah.
[Foreign Language]
For the NAD, because we are going to use the AD as a service model to provide the NAD services to our users. Long term speaking, we long-term speaking, we believe the AD as a Service contribution is going to be included in the other margin and the long-term plan for that margin also the NT 2.0 is going to be much better than the margin of the NT. 1.0. For the vehicle gross margin we believe the target was in the long run is 25% excluding the carbon credits because of the carbon credits that should be included in other margins. And we believe with the logic of other margin is about the install base or the install base of users. For the long run, it will get better considering the future possibilities and opportunities including AD as a Service, Battery as a Service upgrade in your life carbon credit. So we believe of all speaking of all gross margin and the vehicle gross margin will improve.
[Foreign Language] Regarding the long-term target of the market share for us, of course we pay - meaning we pay attention to our specific market share order penetration in the corresponding segment of our products. For example, the ES8 in the large and midsize SUV market segment and the ES6 in the midsize SUV segment. Internally of course we have a very aggressive market share target by 2025. But we don't actually want to disclose this target. For us so we believe four of our targeted as a company should be to build a company with the highest user satisfaction rate. So that is why our focus is on the product and service. We believe if we can achieve the highest user satisfaction rate with other product and services then it should be then a natural thing for us to achieve a satisfactory market share.
In the China market so I would like to talk a little bit about the battery electric SUV premium market segment. For this segment I would like to emphasize a little bit about the pricing because when we compare the specific sales volume of one brand or one product, I think it does not make sense to compare those kind of metrics without thinking about the specific pricing segment. For example, it does not make sense for us to compare the sales volume of mainly EV with the sales volume of NIO because we don't have the same pricing and we don't actually compete in the same segment.
In our specific pricing segment, we have companies like Audi, BMW and Mercedes and for Tesla they also have a Model S and Model X and Model Y. So in this specific pricing segment of our market share has already exceeded the 50%. So we are quite confident to further improve our market share in this specific segment. In Shanghai as I mentioned before in the premium SUV segment including the ICEs and the electric vehicles that we have already reached a close to 14% market penetration in the first half of this year.
This is already quite high and we have already achieved this in the Tier 1 city. So we believe this is a very good indicator for our next step to penetrating into more markets in different cities. Because as I mentioned, our focus is to make sure we have the best product and the services and achieve the highest user satisfactions. So we believe as long as we seek to this vision and this objective issues the financial side to achieve other market share targets in the long run.
[Foreign Language]
Just from the second half of 2019 to the first half of 2020 we have tried the NIO space partner approach. We believe the NIO space partners have contributed to our expansion of the sales network and the sales volume growth. But right now when we look at the overall brand and the management complexity, we believe it makes more sense for us to manage the NIO spaces by ourselves. So starting from the third quarter of 2020 we have changed this strategy and we would like to make sure for the NIO spaces we can manage and build by NIO.
So we discussed with our NIO space partners and reached agreements with the majority of the NIO space partners to transform their NIO spaces to the NIO spaces operated by NIO. So the majority of the NIO space partners have already signed the agreement with us and for the rest of the NIO space partners. We will continue to have cooperation with them until the termination of the contract for all the new NIO spaces. These are all viewed and operated by NIO. Thank you [indiscernible]. Thank you. A better way can you answer the question about what would be 2023 for the NIO mass market brand business? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you. Yeah. Regarding the launch of the mass market products of course our R&D efficiency is quite high and I believe this is the common standing of everyone. NIO has been able to launch products one after another in a very fast manner. So for the mass market brand this is part of a long-term thinking and we believe the efficiency and the speed of the product launch is going to be probably even faster build on top of the abilities that we have already accumulated under the new brand. But regarding the specific timing under the launch cadence of those products under the mass market brand we can still have time to decide based on the market conditions and the R&D progress of those products. So we believe it's still too early for us to share those information for now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Chang Liu from CICC. Chang, your line is now open. Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is about R&D. We know that there is a fierce competition in acquiring temporary [indiscernible] autonomous driving development. So could you [indiscernible] share with us NIO's advantages - advantages in acquiring them? And - and more in details, could you share with us our current team size of AD development and our targeted team size? And is there an update on our R&D expenditure for this year? And my second question is that, could you update the tech [indiscernible] BaaS and the NIO Pilots for us? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your questions. AD is a very important R&D metric. AD [indiscernible] and we are quite decisive to make investment in the autonomous driving technology and organization. Our autonomous driving organization is quite different from other companies that probably because, so we have full VPs report directly to me personally. So as you can see that is the autonomous driving is not just one department it's actually a new initiative for the - of our company. We have teams focusing on hardware, autonomous driving system, autonomous driving algorithm and the autonomous driving operation.
So we believe this is not just the efforts of one IT department. We will need to leverage all the capabilities that we have across the company. Right now for over AD department we have around 500 people. By the end of this year we have around 500 people. By the end of this year we expect it to have additional 300 to 800 for the AD team. We will continue to make a decisive investment in autonomous driving technology and the challenge acquisition starting from 2016. We have already viewed over ADaaS team and autonomous driving team and NIO is the first company to have a mass production of the EyeQ4 chipset and we have built our domain controller, the autonomous driving assistant in-house right from day one. So we have already accumulated many experiences and capabilities in this regard. Coming from last year the main focus of ours is to build up the capabilities in terms of the autonomous driving algorithm into the computer vision we believe that right now we have already built a very strong team.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding the R&D expenses, starting from the second quarter, we have accelerated to offer research and development in the company. As I mentioned, in 2022, we're going to deliver three new products and in 2023 and beyond, probably, we're going to deliver even more products. I believe the NIO is the fastest company in the industry to deliver products to the market. Averagely speaking, the R&D timeline for us is around two years, which is already the fastest in the auto industry. And this year, we have already kicked off many different R&D programs. Starting from the third quarter of this year, we believe that we're going to step up our R&D expenses due to the team size and the programs that we have in the R&D pipeline.
So previously, we also mentioned that the R&D expenses in 2021 should be around RMB 5 billion, and we would like to see this RMB 5 billion spent according to the plan because this shows that our R&D progress is actually on track. So the current focus of ours is to build up our R&D team and then make sure all the development projects is on track according to the product is on track according to the plan and we believe probably by the end of this year the size of our R&D team is going to be doubled compared with the size last year.
[Foreign Language]
The take rate of battery-as-a-service in July has reached 60% and is growing month-over-month. Previously I have also mentioned the take rate for the NIO Pilot has reached 80% including the selected package under the full package. So overall speaking the take rate of BaaS and NIO Pilot is on the rise. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chang. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Edison Yu from DB or Deutsche Bank. Edison, your line is now open. Thank you for taking our questions. I have two follow-ups on Europe first it seems there is quite a bit of hiring going on in the Netherlands and a little bit in Germany. Could you maybe discuss the next phase of Europe after Norway? And then the second question on Europe it's very encouraging to see this user advisory board. Can you maybe discuss some of the things that you're doing differently in Europe relative to what's been going on in China? I think for [indiscernible], I would like to share some numbers with our investors. First, in Norway, our team size has already increased to 40 employees in Norway. And of course Norway is only our first off to go overseas. So in the 40 years we've also entered other European countries and also other regions. So that's why we continue to hire more people in Amsterdam.
[Foreign Language]
Another point is starting actually in the second quarter of this year, we have a pointed the CEO of Europe. He is already on board and he has been building up the team for NIO Europe. Of course, we're going into enter more markets in Europe including Germany. For most of the products, we are going to deliver to Europe is going to be based on the NIO Technology platform 2.0 except the ES8. So this is our current strategy for the European market.
[Foreign Language]
So for NIO as a user enterprise when we enter the markets or different regions, we have always believed the user participation and the support is a very important principle that we should uphold. Of course, for different markets they have different cultures, different environment, different use cases we will need to adapt to those different situations. But so, we believe the user community and the user enterprise concept should apply to overall markets in the world because our vision is to make sure that we can put the user experience and their user interest first. This is a general principle for us.
A very interesting factor that I would like to share with you is that in Norway when we initiated their user advisory board, we thought that probably we should have around 200 people but in the end 700 to 800 people signed up for the user advisory board. So from this example, we can see that actually the Norwegian people are quite willing to participate in those community events because previously through the media report and other literature, they think that the Norwegian people are more cautious towards socializing with other people's. But this example has proven this is the wrong interpretation or the wrong stereotype of the Norwegian people and we believe that the user community concept should apply to all the people in the world. Thank you, Edison. Thank you. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Gong from UBS. Paul your line is now open. Yeah. Thanks, everyone. I have two questions. The first question is regarding your plan to address new models based on the MP2 in 2022. Given most of the NIO space although they cannot put six models of together, will you try to expand the average the size of your deal space. Or are you going to gradually resource via the existing first generation of the products? As just now you mentioned that you'll have a shorthand the differentiation and amortization of the first generation of your products. Does that mean it would be a gradually fizz out and migrate into the second generation of the platform? This is my first question.
My second question is regarding the mass market brand. I understand at this moment you are still pending decisions in terms of the timing and how to position itself. But can we have a little bit color when you think about the relationship of NIO brand versus your NIO mass market brand? Would it be more similar to let's say method Mercedes Benz and Smart or BMW MEV or Audi versus say Volkswagen brand. How do you think about the relationship of the two brands?
I recall in last quarter's results you mentioned that there is only one more thing that somehow assured that is, would income from EVT reversion. Is that an indication that somehow the recent online discussion say on NIO's mass market brand which also announced some tiny small vehicles. Is it something you are bearing in mind at this moment? Thank you. Yeah.
[Foreign Language]
Overall speaking we understand the different campaigns will have different strategies regarding their product offering. We would like to offer more diversified choices to our users but we also need to strike a balance because we're not going to like the traditional OEMs to launch a CF product for the users to choose from and we are also not going to like other companies to just offer two to three products for the users to choose. We believe the different users will have a different preference and taste regarding the body sizes, body type the design. So that is why we would like to offer limited but diversified product offerings to our users.
We understand the era of Model T happened 100 years ago and right now the timing and ages are quite different for us. So that is why they say [indiscernible] strategy regarding the product and the NIO houses and NIO spaces of course we are going to adopt the digital technologies or properly use the rotation mechanism to make sure users can still experience our products in the NIO houses and the NIO spaces. But according to the current data we have right now it seems that the majority of our users actually place their orders online. So we believe that this is not going to pose a significant issue for us.
Regarding the NIO Technology Platform 1.0, we understand all of our current product are based on the NT 1.0. It's actually quite competitive. If we compare with Audi, BMW, for example, their EV products, I believe all of our products are still quite competitive, and when it comes to their ICE product, I think our product actually does not belong to the same generation with their ICE products. So for the NIO Technology Platform 1.0 products, we'll believe that they are still quite competitive and we'll continue to sell those products in the market.
And regarding the three new products that we're going to deliver in the 2022, we believe that this is not going to affect the upgrade the pace or the normal upgrade pace of the products on the NIO Technology Platform 1.0. But just now Stanley have also mentioned that we have taken a more prudent approach to shorten the depreciation and amortization period for the NIO Technology Platform 1.0. So this also shows that in the future we're going to upgrade our product on the NT 1.0.
[Foreign Language]
I believe you have a very good question and you made a very good comparison. I guess if we just take the positioning of the new brand and the new mass market brand, a simple comparison is going to be more like the relationship between Audi and Volkswagen and the Lexus with the Toyota. But this is more about the positioning of these two new brands. Of course, we're not going to enter the segment also in [indiscernible]. We believe that they have already done a very good job in their specific segment. We would like to do something different and offer different products for the mass market. Basically our thinking is that we would like to launch products that can have a competitive pricing compared with Tesla's product, but to have much better products and services… Best services, much better service. …and have better products and the much better services compared with Tesla. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Chung from Citi. Jeff your line is now open. Hey. Hi. Hello, William and Steven. Great results. And I have three questions. One is the about the ET7. If this pricing is being set above RMB 400,000 - can we say that the 2Q margin should be much higher than the current level say - let's say around 30% to 35% level 2Q margin which is a potential. And secondly is about the export margin so let's say if the scale reached like 2,000 units to 3,000 units a month, can we say that that is 2Q margin accretive because we heard that exports to overseas ASP could be much higher. So could you give us a little bit color or do you think the export margin will be similar than the China domestic. Yeah, that is the first area.
And the second question is about the G&A and as you just mentioned is going to accelerate into the second half of the year and I just heard you said that equivalent to the cost per car to increase by about 3%, right. So can I clarify this a little bit whether this was mainly reflected in the 2Q margin or that EBIT margin? And finally it's about the R&D and SG&A.
So previously we expect this year's R&D to be about RMB 5.2 billion, SG&A around - above RMB 6 billion. So going forward in the 2Q do you see that there could be still a potential that this [indiscernible] should be increasing faster than our revenue growth. And when do you think this [indiscernible] growth will be slower than our revenue growth if we start from two to three or two to four yeah, that's my three question. Thank you.
[Foreign Language] Thank you for your question, Jeff. About overall speaking for the gross margin targets, previously I have also mentioned that on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0, the vehicle gross margin target should be at the level of 25%. So on the current data we gathered it seems that the ET7 should be able to each this target. But the actual additional gross margins of ET7 will need to be validated until the mass production and the delivery of ET7 to our users. So for the other product or for the product on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0 including ET7 it will probably meet the 25% zero gross margin level and this is our target first and for the other margins just like I explained that we have ADS service, NIO Life battery as a service upgrade and the swapping services. All this is included in the other margins. So this will also contribute to the improvement of other margins. For the export of business over current strategy, that we'd like to have global pricing. But for the specific pricing in different markets it will vary a little bit considering the tax and the tariffs in different countries. We accelerated our depreciation and amortization for the fixed assets for end-to-end products, that will be booked in the cost per vehicle. So gross profit margin starting from Q3 will decrease by 2% as I mentioned in the prior questions. Yeah. Okay. And also Jeff with regard to the [ph] fixed ratio we believe for now the next 12 months is a very decisive window for us to accelerate our product development and also service and track infrastructure deployment. However, in front the second half contributed to our economy of scale will gradually manifest and our expense ratio will start to decline again. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Stephen. Thank you, William. Thank you so much. [Foreign Language] Thank you. As there are no further questions now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website.

Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO’s third quarter 2021 earnings call.
[Foreign Language]
In the third quarter of 2021, we delivered 24,439 ES8, ES6 and EC6, a new quarterly record representing a solid growth of 100.2% year-over-year.
[Foreign Language]
Based on the overall production planning from September 28 to October 15 to prepare for further capacity expansion and new product introduction including ET7, we implemented upgrade and restructuring of manufacturing lines at the Hefei JAC-NIO advanced manufacturing center. Affected by the upgrades and the restructuring, we delivered 3,667 vehicles in October. The plant has resumed to normal production since late October.
[Foreign Language]
According to the data published by China Passenger Car Association, the penetration rate of battery electric vehicles among passenger vehicles reached 17.5% in September. As the automotive industry is accelerating its transformation towards smart titration and electrification, more and more users are now choosing smart EVs over ICEs.
The order momentum continues to be strong and our new orders have reached a new all-time high in October. Currently, our delivery volume is mainly constrained by supply chain volatilities. We expect that the total delivery in the fourth quarter of 2021 to be between 23,500 to 25,500 vehicles.
[Foreign Language]
In the third quarter, the vehicle gross margin stood at 18.0%, while the overall gross margin reached 20.3%, benefited from the sales of a regulatory credit.
[Foreign Language]
Next, I would like to share with you some recent operational highlights of the company.
[Foreign Language]
In September, the first batch of ET7 tooling trial build wrote off the production line representing that the try outs and the commissioning of the overall manufacturing process have been completed. The teams are making final preparations for the mass production of ET7.
During this appropriation process, we have also made various product optimizations on ET7. For example, the drag coefficient of ET7 was improved from 0.23 to 0.208. We are very confident about the final product competitiveness and the market performance of the ET7.
[Foreign Language]
The software and hardware development of NAD are also pressing ahead on schedule. The development of the other two new products on NIO technology platform 2.0 are also moving forward smoothly and the delivery to users is expected to start in the second half of next year. We will share more product details at NIO Day 2021.
[Foreign Language]
In September, we launched the 75 KW hour standard range battery pack with LFP/NCM hybrid cells, which has further enhanced the competitiveness of NIO’s battery systems, empowered by the industry first LFP/NCM cell layout and advanced software and hardware systems of thermal management and SoC estimation.
NIO’s battery system team worked closely with our partner, in overcoming the disadvantages of the LFP cells, in aspect of low temperature performance and SoC estimation. On top of that, the 75-kilowatt hour hybrid battery pack has also achieved higher energy density and longer drive range and lower cost, compared with the 70-kilowatt hour NCM battery pack.
[Foreign Language]
In terms of production capacity, besides the upgrades and the restructuring of the manufacturing lines in JAC-NIO advanced manufacturing center, the second manufacturing site at NIO Park in Hefei is also under construction. After the kick-off on April 29th, we completed the main structure construction on August 26, and will start the equipment installation at end of this month. In the third quarter of 2022, we will begin production officially.
[Foreign Language]
On the supply side, due to global COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events, and other factors, the overall supply chain remained challenging. Our supply chain team, R&D team, and the partners have adopted a series of measures to support the record-high quarterly deliveries in the third quarter, and will continue to secure the supply for the delivery in the fourth quarter and upcoming new product production.
[Foreign Language]
With regards to the sales and service network, we now have 32 NIO houses and 285 NIO spaces in 132 cities in China. We will continue to expand and optimize other NIO House and NIO space coverage to effectively penetrate into more Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. As of now, we have 43 NIO service centers and 181 authorized service centers in 141 cities. We will build more service centers, to ensure high quality services to the rapidly growing user base.
[Foreign Language]
Up until now, we have deployed 608 battery swap stations in 153 cities in China and completed over 4.74 million swaps. In addition, we have built over 460 power charger stations and 3,155 destination chargers across China.
[Foreign Language]
As we speed up the deployment of the battery – of the swapping and charging infrastructure, the superior experience and the value brought forward by battery swapping technology and Battery-as-a-Service, has made us the go-to-choice for more and more users.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding the global market, we opened our NIO house in Norway on September 30, which has attracted wide attention from both the public and the media. On the same day, we started to deliver ES8 and provide services to our users in Norway. Besides achieving Euro NCAP 5-star safety rating, the ES8 has also received great reviews on its performance and the product experience from the local users and the media.
The order intake has exceeded our expectations. More importantly, among all the orders, 92% of the users have chosen us. NIO’s products, services, and innovative business model, not only have been well received in China, but also present unique value and strength in the global market. In 2022, we will further step up our efforts in entering more global markets.
[Foreign Language]
Users have always been the foundation of NIO. A diversified user community brings a greater vitality to NIO and drives NIO to become better.
In October, NIO and the NIO User Trust joined hands with Sanjiangyuan Ecology Protection Foundation to build a growing ecosystem in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. With much anticipation, we have announced that NIO Day 2021 will be held in Suzhou on December 18 this year. NIO user advisors and NIO Day organizing committee are working closely on the final preparation. Please stay tuned for the coming NIO Day organized together by NIO and our users.
[Foreign Language]
In 2021, NIO has doubled down on investments in product development, capacity expansion, charging and swapping network, as well as sales and service networks. In 2022, we will continue to make a decisive investment to further enhance our long-term competitiveness, and provide better products and services to users.
[Foreign Language]
As always, thank you for your support. With that I will now turn the call over to Steven, to provide the financial details for the quarter.
Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results. For the third quarter of 2021, and to be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB9.81 billion or $1.52 billion, representing an increase of 116.6% year-over-year, an increase of 16.1% quarter-over-quarter.
Our total revenues are made of two parts; vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the third quarter was RMB8.64 billion or $1.34 billion, accounting for 88% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 102.4% year-over-year, an increase of 9.2% quarter-over-quarter.

Other sales this third quarter were RMB1.1 billion or $181.4 million, representing an increase of 350.8% year-over-year, an increase of 117.9% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the sales of automotive regulatory credits and the batteries upgrade service, as well as other revenues, which increased in line with incremental vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2021.
Cost of sales in the third quarter was RMB10.81 billion or $1.21 billion, representing an increase of 98.3% year-over-year and an increase of 13.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales was in line with revenue growth, which was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle delivery volume in the third quarter of 2021.
Gross profit in the third quarter was RMB1.99 billion or $0.31 billion, representing an increase of 240.3% year-over-year, and increase of 26.6% quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin in the third quarter was 20.3%, compared with 12.9% in the same quarter of 2020, and 18.6% in the second quarter of 2021.
The increase in gross margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of vehicle margin and sales of automotive regulatory credits. The increase of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the sales of automotive regulatory credits.
More specifically, vehicle margin in the third quarter was 18.0%, compared with 14.5% in the same quarter of 2020, and 20.3% in the second quarter of 2021. The increase of vehicle margin year-over-year, was mainly driven by the higher average selling price, as well as have lower material cost.
The decrease of vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the increased financing at subsidized rates for vehicle purchases, which resulted in a deduction of vehicle revenue and increase in tooling depreciation costs.
R&D expenses in third quarter were RMB1.19 billion or $185.2 million, representing an increase of 101.9% year-over-year, an increase of 35% quarter-over-quarter. The increase of R&D expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to increased personnel costs, new research and development functions, as well as incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter were RMB1.82 billion or $0.28 billion, representing an increase of 94.1% year-over-year, an increase of 21.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the increase of personnel costs in sales and service functions and costs related to sales and service network expansion.

Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the third quarter were both RMB1.82 or $0.28 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interest to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB0.36 or $0.06 per ADS. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB47 billion or $10.3 billion as of September 30, 2021.
And now for all of this outlook, as William mentioned, for the fourth quarter of 2021, the company expects deliveries to be between 23,500 and 25,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 35.4% to 46.9% from the same quarter of 2020 and a decrease of approximately 3.8% to an increase of approximately 4.3% from the third quarter of 2021.
The company also expects the total revenues on the fourth quarter of 2021, to be between RMB9.38 billion and RMB10.11 billion, representing an increase of approximately 41.2% to 52.2% from the same quarter of 2020 and a decrease of approximately 4.4% to an increase of approximately 3.1% from the third quarter of 2021.
This business outlook reflects the company’s current and the preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to be change.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tim Hsiao of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Hi Will, and Steven, and team. Thanks for taking my question. It’s great to see NIO manage to navigate through the component crunch and production hiccup in first half. Just two quick questions from my side. The first one, we have seen restructuring and upgrade of the production lines, costs around two rounds of disruption to our delivery and production this year.
Just wanted to confirm that, if we completed all the necessary restructuring for the three new models next year or should we expect any similar disruption sometime next year?
My second question is about the details of the other sales. Could you share more information about NIO’s third quarter other sales, because it has been surging quite a lot? I think a more significant revenue increase was attributable to the sales of EV credits and the battery upgrade services.
Can we have the further breakdowns regarding the contribution from both items, and what could be the scale, as well as the contribution into fourth quarter? Because if you look at the current fourth quarter revenue guidance, it seems that it just mainly reflected the contribution from the weaker sales. So should we expect a contribution from other sales to rise further? Those are my two questions. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Tim, thank you for your question. I will answer the first one and Stanley is going to answer the second one. In the previous remarks, we have also talked about the progress of our capacity expansion for the two plants.
For the first half funds, just like you mentioned, starting from the end of September to the middle of October, we have some restructuring and upgrades of the manufacturing lines to further expand the production capacity and prepare for the new product introductions.
Following this upgrade, we probably will do some minor restructurings and modifications of the production lines. But we believe the following restructuring is not going to have a very significant impact on the normal production of the vehicles.
Secondly, regarding the new products, some of the new products will be manufactured in the second plant. Then this means that for the second plant, we will need some time to ramp up the production for the new products, but this is not going to affect the manufacturing of the existing products. Hi, Tim. Regarding the second question, among the other revenue, RMB517 million was contributed by the EV credit sales and after deduction of this EV credit sales, our total gross margin for other revenue decreased from minus 5.6% to 12.6%, that’s because the – it’s driven by the expansion of our sales and service network in Q3.
And as mentioned by William in his explanation, the construction of our sales and service network infrastructure moved earlier and faster than our sales increase, especially in this year. So, we are expecting the total revenue of other service will increase, but the gross profit margin for these products will decrease a little bit in Q4. Yes. Okay. Great. Could you - sorry, just a quick follow-up some – could you highlight some potential contribution from the sales of credit into fourth quarter? Yes. Almost, majority of the EV credit sales was realized in Q3. So in Q4, we don’t expect a significant revenue from this part. Yes. Got it great. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Yes, just like as Stanley explained, this year is a bit different from last year. We recognized the sales of the regulatory credits much earlier, compared with last year. Thank you, Will. Your next question comes from Nick Lai of JP Morgan. Please ask your question. Thank you for taking my question. It’s Nick from JP Morgan. Good morning, William and Steven. My two simple question is, number one related to margin, and the second question is related to ET7, the new exciting model.
First of all on the margin front, yes, vehicle margin third quarter was 18%, slightly down from 20% in 2Q. Yes, I wonder how should we think about the margin into 4Q or first half next year taking into account of two factors; the first factor is the pricing dynamic or competition from the peers and the second is improved raw material prices, especially on the battery front. That’s the first question. And I mean, I think you answered part of my question earlier on credit sales.
So, second question on ET7, it’s simply a very exciting product, when should we expect the car to hit a showroom in the near term? And medium to longer term, after production is ramped up, how should we think about the volume and the possibility of ET7, relative to our current high-end product, ES8? ES8’s current monthly run rate, sales volume is monthly about 1,500. So, how should we think about the profit margin and the volume for ET7. That’s two simple questions. Thank you. Hi, Nick. This is Stanley. About your first question regarding the gross profit margin and our 75-kilowatt hours battery start to - will start to be delivered from November. And gross profit margin will be improved a little bit, compared with the 70-kilowatt hours battery.
But prices of our key materials like aluminum, copper, and also chips increase - are increasing as there will be pressures for our cost controlling. But we are confident to continuously improve our gross profit margin, which combines efforts, either from the product design or supply chain optimization.
So for Q4, we are expecting that gross profit margin will keep stable and for next year, our target is to achieve 20% gross profit margin for vehicles. And along with our launch of NT2.0 products from a long run perspective, we try to achieve the higher profit margin with about 25% - yes, of vehicles. [Foreign Language]
As Stanley mentioned, yes, as Stanley mentioned, basically, for the NT2.0 product, we expect that with the economy of scales and the volume ramp up, as well as the optimizations in every aspect. We should be able to average 25% vehicle gross margin in the long run. At the beginning, of course, we will need some time to ramp up the production of the new products based on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0.
According to our preliminary estimation internally, we believe the vehicle gross margin of the new product should be quite good. And for the ET7 delivery, we are going to start the delivery of ET7 in the first quarter of next year. So it means that, we will have the cars in our NIO Houses and NIO Spaces around the spring festivals time.
Then afterwards, we will start deliveries to the users, because we have used many advanced chips and sensors on the ET7. So this has a put a lot of pressure on the mass production of ET7. But we believe everything is on schedule.
[Foreign Language]
Thank you, Nick. Your next question comes from Mr. Ming-Hsun Lee of Bank of America Securities. Please ask your question. Thank you. Good morning. William, Steven, and Stanley. So my question is regarding your supply chain. So, right now, actually, we are hearing some of the auto company expect the chip shortage situation will not be fully resolved by the mid of next year. So, right now, I want to hear your latest view regarding your chip supply situation and also the large size battery pack supply situation.
And also, right now for your consumers, if they place orders to you, I think at the waiting time is more than two months already. So, how will you retain long-term consumers? And also, next year, we expect the EV purchase subsidy to be cut further. So, in this case, if the consumer priced older before year-end, but they need to - we need to deliver a car after, I think next year. So will we continue to give them a similar subsidy amount, so we absorb at the subsidy cut? That is my question. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you, Ming for the question. Regarding the chip shortage situation, we believe right now it’s much better than the situation in Q3. But the challenge is still quite big, because it’s very difficult to forecast what is going to happen for the chip supply.
I think everyone knows about the STMicro’s situation in Malaysia and the situation basically is improving right now. The good thing is our teams have learned to adapt to the situation and face the challenges head-on and we have always been able to find a solution to all those challenges.
On the other hand, our volume compared to the material OEMs is still relatively small. So the challenge is for us is smaller compared to the mature OEMs.
[Foreign Language]
I would like to specifically mention that because the many domain controllers in our vehicles are actually developed by ourselves in-house. So if there is a shortage of certain chips in the domain controllers, our teams have the capability to quickly find the alternative and do the rapid validation and faster production of the vehicles and the chips.
So, because of these capabilities, we have already resolved some chip shortage situations happened to our vehicles.
For the 75-kilowatt hour battery pack, we announced this in September that we will gradually start the delivery of the 75-kilowatt hour battery pack in late November. We also need some time to ramp up of the production of the new battery pack and we believe that the production is going to reach a reasonable level to the first quarter of next year.
The battery is actually a very big constraint for us. CATL is our partner on the battery side, they have invested a lot to help us and support our vehicle production. But we believe the battery is still the main constraint on the overall production and supply capacity.
[Foreign Language]
Yes. As I mentioned, if you place the order, right now, you will need to wait for some time to get the cars delivered. But recently, we have also announced some policies regarding the subsidy reduction for the next year to keep our customers and also keep our customers during this long waiting time.
For example, we will provide a NIO credit or NIO points to the users during this waiting time and these kind of incentives have helped us in the past. For example, starting from 2018, we have already got those policies in place and we believe that this is not going to affect the users regarding the waiting time.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding the EV subsidy, we believe this is not going to have a significant impact on us, because our average selling pricing is actually quite high regarding our product. So even considering the subsidy is not going to be a very big amount, comparing to the selling price of the vehicles.
[Foreign Language]
Thank you. Your next question comes from Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please ask the question. Thank you for taking my question. I got two ones. On the first one about application IPO, because one of the key constraint is that NIO seems to be the only one still just in the U.S. and also some of the media report is because of the NIO User Trust. Can you explain a little bit why NIO User Trust could be one of the reason when you come back to IPO? That is the first question.
And second thing is about gross margin. Actually, you mentioned one of the reasons, because auto finance, due to the margin decline. However, if you have seen the demand has been very good and short on supply. I mean, I am just curious, why we in a very tight supply will still increase the auto finance, due to the falling margin.
Theoretically, should reduce the auto finance line. And also I told some of my friends coming at you actually may remove or reduce the auto price in the number four quarter. Can I confirm if this is the case, can I assume the gross margin we have increase in the number four quarter, compared to number three, because you don’t provide auto finance anymore.
And the average ASP also increased, because auto finance seems to be one of the reason for ASP decline in the number three quarter, compared to the second quarter. Thank you. Bin, this is Steven. Thank you for your questions. I would like – with regard to your first question, I have two comments. First, we’re open minded. We are closely monitoring the market and we’ll make the right choice in the best interest of our shareholders. Second, we actually explore the possibilities to get listed in Hong Kong market and we are indeed doing what’s necessary to evaluate and communicate. [Foreign Language]
Thank you, Bin for your question. Yes, so we will make the decisions to best serve the interest of our investors and we will be open-minded to different choices. Regarding the impact of the auto financing on the margin, if you get to know about our business operations you will know that we will need to take some measures such as balance of the supply and the product considerations, as well as the user demands.
For example, with the 75-kilowatt hour battery pack, we announced this battery pack in September. Many users would like it to wait for this 75-kilowatt hour battery pack. But just like I mentioned, we will start the delivery of this battery pack in late November and even at that time, we will still need some time to ramp up the production of the battery pack to a reasonable level.
That is why, we will need to take some measures to balance this demand among the users and the product configuration, as well as the battery supply and we encourage the users to choose the 100-kilowatt hour battery pack in that case.
We believe the right approach for this not to reduce the price of our product or offer discount to our users on the vehicle price. And so, that is why, we would like to take those measures to balance the demand and supply. But this is not going to be the long-term measures we take. This is only a short-term measure for us to balance the supply and the demand situation.
Once the supply gets to a reasonable level in the long run, then we believe the big - the overall gross margin and the vehicle gross margin is going to improve.
[Foreign Language] Thank you. Your next question comes from Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Hi, everyone. And thank you for taking our questions. First question is on the ET7 ADAS capabilities. Could you maybe discuss what kind of features we could expect at launch? And if you can’t reveal that right now, would you expect to do any sort of demonstrations on the road in the coming months, similar to what other competitors have done?
And then, second question, more longer-term, last year at NIO Day, you kind of teased a solid state battery or a hybrid solid state battery coming to the vehicles, I believe at the end of next year. Is there any update on this? Is this still on track? Any details you could provide there, that’d be great. Thank you [Foreign Language]
Actually, I believe a lot of people are working on the demos. So, we don’t actually want the teams to focus their energy on the demo. We would like to have the teams to be fully dedicated to the mass production of the technology and offer new product like the ET7. Regarding the ET7 NAD, we will need some time to gradually release those advanced features to the users and we believe for all of the features, and of course it will be based on our in-house full stack technology.
Previously, I have also explained that the NAD features will be released to the users based on the subscription like the ADS service. So this innovative business model has offered us some flexibilities in terms of how should we provide and when should we provide all those services and features to the users.
We will need to strike a balance between different factors including the regulations, safety, and reliability. Then after we strike the perfect balance or find a sweet spot, then we can start to provide those services to the users. I believe right now, there are hundreds of companies working on those kind of demos, so we don’t want to waste our energy on that.
Regarding the 150-kilowatt hour battery pack, we are now working together with our partners and everything is basically on track. Previously, we mentioned that we will start the delivery of this battery pack in the fourth quarter of next year and we believe we should be able to meet this schedule. Thank you. Thank you, Edison. Your next question comes from Jeff Chung of Citi. Please ask your question. Hey. Hi, William, Steven. I got three questions. Number one, what kind of annualized total volume production from the NT2.0 platform should lead to the 25% GP margin according to your guidance? Secondly - second question is, apart from the three brand new products launching in 2022, how likely are we going to launch the facelift version of the existing product, the ES8, ES6 and EC6?
So, how likely we are going to launch six new products next year instead of three brand new products? And finally, is the EV credit, so could you guide us how many points we sold in the third quarter? So - and from which we can estimate the ASP and the credit compared with previous quarters? Thank you, William. Thank you, Steven. Jeff, with regard to your first question about GP margin, our 25% GP margin for NP2.0 platform is based on the annual production volume of 300,000 units per year. [Foreign Language]
Just like Steven mentioned that, our plan is, if we can achieve annual production of 300,000 units, we should be able to reach 25% vehicle gross margin on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0. We are very confident to achieve this target. For the existing product, of course, we have a plan to upgrade over product to the NIO Technology Platform 2.0.
And we believe that this is very important for the company and we will need to focus manage the schedule for the product upgrades in specific details. Internally, we have already kicked off the development to work on this regard and we have started, how should we upgrade the different products to the NIO Technology Platform 2.0. Yes. About the EV credits, totally around 200,000 points were sold in Q3. And what I want to remind is the price volatility for EV credit is also high, along with China’s EV penetration increase recently. So I hope this helps you to build the expectation for our futures - NIO credit revenue. Yes. [Foreign Language]
This year, basically, we believe the number of the credits we receive will increase. But this year, the penetration rate of the EV has increased very rapidly. This probably is going to change the situation for next year regarding the regulatory credit sales. According to my personal estimation, I think considering all those factors, the price of the EV credit is going to be different or probably going to be lower, compared with this year’s price.
[Foreign Language] Your next question comes from Paul Gong of UBS. Please ask your question. Yes, hi. Thanks guys. I have two questions. The first one is regarding the – our Norway operation and obviously, it has been more than one month. And you just briefly mentioned 92% of the users chose us, and the order has been exceeding your expectation.
Can you give us more color like how the achievement if it was there? And what challenges over there? Obviously, it’s a rich country, but the labor cost might also be much higher than in China. What can you share with us? And after Norway, what is your next destination for the overseas operation?
The second question is regarding your expense spending. It seems that for this quarter, the increase in SG&A has been a bit faster than expected, while the R&D increase has been a little bit slower than you expected. What is the key rationale behind it and key reasons behind?
Again, you have so many orders and deliveries because of the supply chain disruption, where you can see the slowdown a little bit of the SG&A and instead to put more budget into the R&D in the following one or two quarters.
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question. Regarding our operations in Norway, we believe the basic operations have a mix of expectations in all aspects. After the NIO House opened on September 30, I would like to share with you some data. After the test drive, one-fourth of the users have placed orders for our products. We believe this is very impressive and this shows to me that basically the efficiency is much higher, compared with that of here in China. This is on the delivery side.
On the services side, so, we do need a lot of work to do. Our swap stations in Norway have just started the operation, because previously we need to send people over to work on the installation and on the commissioning of the swap stations. And then, for the after-sales we also encountered some challenges brought forward by the COVID situation.
But the order momentum is quite strong. We have done some trial delivery at the end of September and in October and we believe the delivery in November is going to improve significantly. There is a lot of order backlog. But we would like to control our pace of delivery a little bit at the beginning, because internally we set the target of ourselves, especially on the user satisfaction rate.
We have a kind of VAU, it’s Vision Action Upgrade designed in the company and the basically we use the VAU to set the target for ourselves. My personal VAU is to make sure we can achieve high user satisfaction rates. And right now, according to the feedback we got from the ground in Norway, we understand that the word of mouth reputation has been quite good.
And one of my friend actually sent a video to me to show that there are lot of visitors in the NIO House, I am very happy to see if this video see so many people in our NIO House in Norway. We will continue to make a decisive investment on the service and on other aspects and we will do this step-by-step.
Next year, besides Norway, we are going to enter additional five countries in Europe. And for this product planning of all those European countries and basically the ES8 based on the NIO technology platform 1.0 will only be sold in Norway. But the for other new Norway countries, we are going to enter, we will only sell the products based on the NIO Technology Platform 2.0.
[Foreign Language].
I believe for the investment question, this is more about the long-term competitiveness or the long-term strategy for the company. In China, the competition is becoming more fierce, because there have been many new entrants into the smart EV industry. We believe product development, technology development, sales and service network infrastructure, including swapping and charging network are part of the long-term competitiveness of the company.
That is why we double down on our investment in all those regard in 2021. In 2022, we will continue to make a decisive investment on those aspects. We believe the infrastructure like the swapping charging network, the sales and service network are also part of the long-term competitiveness of the company.
And maybe in the third quarter of this year, the investment on those aspects have ramped up faster than expected. That is why we can see the SG&A cost increased higher than the previous expectation. But on the R&D side. We have also doubled our R&D personnel this year, and we have worked on – we have been working on many new products and the new technologies. But for other new products and the technologies, it will need some time to ramp up the pace.
In the fourth quarter, we will be able to see some R&D expenses and the cost increase in this regard. You can imagine internally, right now, we have multiple new products and new projects working in parallel. Then probably at the beginning when we set up those projects, the cost is not going to be that high, and we will need some time to reflect all those R&D investment on our balance sheet or P&L.
At the beginning, it is relatively small but gradually a long way to the project, this cost is going to increase. But we believe that the product and technology should be the cornerstone of the company’s long-term competitiveness. And that’s why we will continue to make decisive investment on those regards.
[Foreign Language] Thank you very much. Your next question comes from Chang Liu of CICC. Please ask your question. Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is regarding the capacity expansion. So could you give us a guidance on next year’s sales volume, especially for the new three models and also our current three models? So can our capacity needs meet in next year. And considering the strong EV demand on our new – more new models in 2023, do we have a plan in constructing more new plants.
My second question is regarding the upgrade of smart hardware, because we are expecting a really fast upgrade in the smart hardware in next years. So how do we keep our competitiveness of our next models and to keep our users satisfied?
Also, I have a follow-up question for our globalization. So in longer term, do we have a guidance for the proportion of overseas sales accounted for the overall sales? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you, Liu Chang, for your questions. Right now, we have basically two plants. The first plant, like I mentioned that we have upgraded the manufacturing lines to further expand the production capacity. For the new plant, we are going to start the production in the third quarter of next year. So, for our product and operations, we believe these two new plants - these two plants should be able to support our demand for the short-term.
If we combine these two plants together, the maximum production capacity we can support is up to 600,000 annual production capacity based on double shifts. So we believe this maximum production capacity should be able to satisfy our demand in the short-term.
[Foreign Language]
For the NIO Technology Platform 1.0 smart hardware upgrades, we previously communicated with our users that we will study some plants to upgrade the hardware on the NIO Technology Platform 1.0 based on our design.
On the NIO Technology Platform 2.0, we plan to probably provide its services starting from next year, and we will provide some more details and updates on this regard at a more suitable time. Of course, this smart hardware upgrade on the NIO Technology platform 1.0 is not going to be the same as the same kind of experience of the NIO Technology Platform 2.0, but we believe the digital carpet of the existing product is going to significantly improve.
We have already considered all those flexibilities and the possibilities of the hardware and software upgrades in our product design. And for example, just now, I mentioned about the hardware upgrades and then for the software aspects we have been continuously upgrading our software.
We launched and released our Aspen 3.0 to our users of the existing products and received great reviews and feedback from all those users. And we will continue to upgrade our software and iterate our software to make sure we can provide much better services and experiences to our users.
[Foreign Language]
Regarding the previous Aspen 3.0, we also believe that this provides a solid foundation for our global market entry and if we go back to your question about the global market entry and the target for the global markets, NIO has always aspired to build a global brand.
If we look at the global market, we can see that China is still the biggest auto market and the biggest premium market. So, China will still be the most important market for us. But regarding our aspiration for the global markets, I cannot provide very specific targets for the global market at this moment. But I believe for the markets outside of China in the long-term they should account for around 50% of all sales of our product. Yes. Thank you. William. [Foreign Language] As there are no further questions, now, I’d like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, once again for joining us today.

William, please go ahead. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. In the fourth quarter of 2021 we delivered 25,034 ES8, ES6 and EC6 representing an increase of 44% year over year. 2021 was a year full of challenges for NIO and the global auto industry. By overcoming the pandemic, semiconductor shortages, supply chain volatilities and many other difficulties we have continued to lead the premium smart electric vehicle market in China with a total delivery of 91,429 new vehicles in 2021 representing a strong increase of 109.1%. In January 2022 NIO delivered 9,652 vehicles increasing by 34% year over year. In light of the Chinese New Year holiday NIO delivered 6,131 vehicles in February 2022 representing a growth of 10% year over year. During the holiday we adjusted the production lines to prepare for the delivery of ET7 in late March 2022. Although user demand and order momentum remains strong, production and delivery have been affected by COVID and the volatility of the supply chain production capacity. We expect total delivery in the first quarter of 2022 to be between 25,000 to 26,000 vehicles. We will start the delivery of ET7, the first product on NT2 on March 28, 2022. In early March we kicked off the test drive of ET7 nation-wide. Users who test drove ET7 have spoken highly about the product. The test drive to order conversion rate exceeds our expectations which gives us great confidence towards the competitiveness of NT2. In 2021 the battery electric vehicle market maintained a faster than expected up-trend. According to China Passenger Car Association the retail penetration rate of battery electric vehicles grew from 5.9% in January to 18.6% in December last year. In Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities in China such as Shanghai, the penetration rate of battery electric vehicles witnessed a more prominent growth. In Shanghai, among the sales of all ICE and electric SUVs priced above RMB350,000 NIO enjoyed a market share of 23% with its sales ranked at the top in 2021. We believe that this EV growth trend will also gradually expand to Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities in the future. In terms of gross margin, benefitted from the increase of revenue per vehicle and the cost optimization brought forward by the 75kWh LFP NCM hybrid battery. The vehicle gross margin reached 20.9% in Q4 2021 and 20.1% for the full year 2021 respectively. Currently the whole industry is confronted with the pressure of cost increases. We are paying close attention to the dynamics in the supply chain and are working closely with other partners to enhance efficiency in order to reduce the impact to the vehicle gross margin. On a separate note, NIO started to be listed, by way of introduction, on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under Stock Code 9866 from March 10, 2022. The listing in Hong Kong marks another milestone in the history of NIO and enables us to serve more investors in the future. Next, I would like to share some recent key highlights of our R&D and operations. In 2021 we started to step up our investment in R&D with the overall non-GAAP R&D expenses exceeding RMB4.1 billion in 2021. We have sped up the development of new products and increased our investments in full-stack autonomous driving and other core technologies. Investment in R&D is of a critical importance for near to long-term competitiveness. Starting from this year, we will be able to see part of the fruitful results from last year's R&D investment and efforts. In 2022, we plan to deliver three new products based on NT2 with ET7 being the first. The mass production of ET7 is well on track. The product itself has led the industry in various aspects including computing power for autonomous driving. At the NIO Day on December 18, 2021, we unveiled ET5, a mid-size smart electric sedan. As a perfect combination of NIO's supercar DNA and the concept of design for AD, ET5 is equipped with NAD NIO autonomous driving and PanoCinema, panoramic digital cockpit enabled by AR and the VR technologies. It comes as standard with 100 configurations for comfort, safety and smart technology. After the launch, ET5 has attracted a wider and more diversified user base and received more orders than our expectations. The delivery of ET5 is expected to start in September this year. Soon we also launch ES7 our first SUV model on NT2 which is positioned as a mid-large premium five-seater SUV and expected to start delivery from the third-quarter of this year. In the coming years, we will continue to elevate both our R&D investment and efforts in core technologies especially in key capabilities such as the full-stack autonomous driving and battery technologies. We believe the investment in core technologies will not only enhance our sustainable competitiveness in both of our technologies and products but also improve our gross margin and profitability in the long run and ultimately create long-term value for our shareholders. With regards to production capacity, the production line upgrade at the JAC-NIO advanced manufacturing center is in progress phase by phase. By mid-year, the production cadence across all workshops will reach 60 jobs per hour. We have largely completed the building construction of our second manufacturing facility F2 located in NeoPark. Finished the equipment installation and are now working on the calibration, F2 is planned to be put in operation in third quarter this year with a designed production cadence of 60 jobs per hour. On March 16, the first validation viewed of ET5 rolled off the production line from the F2 vehicle powered production center. On the side of the supply chain, we are still faced with challenges from chip supply volatility, raw material cost increase, COVID and the changing international situation. In the past two years and more, our teams and partners have accumulated rich experience in securing supplies for production. We will continue to work closely and to try our best to safeguard the production and delivery going forward. 2021 has been a year of decisive investment in charging and swapping infrastructure as well as the sales and service network. In terms of the sales and service network, we now have 46 NIO houses and 341 NIO spaces in 155 cities worldwide. In China, we have 60 new service centers and 179 authorized service centers in 146 cities. As the sales and service network expands quickly, we have been continuously optimizing the network deployment and the operational efficiency of each touchpoint while delivering high quality services to users. In 2022, we plan to open more than 100 new sales outlets and over 50 new service centers and authorized service centers. In terms of the charging and swapping network, we have deployed 866 battery swap stations in 190 cities and completed over 7.6 million swaps in China. So far, we have 711 super charging stations and 3786 destination chargers in China. In 2022, we will add 30 new destination charging routes to the Power Up Plan. With that, NIO will accumulatively operate over 1300 battery swap stations, 6000 power chargers and 10,000 destination chargers in China. We will further expand our power network to provide a better charging and swapping experience to users. In the global market, ES8 has formed an appreciation of users in Norway. This year, our monthly deliveries have ranked the top two among the six-seater or seven-seater passenger cars. The successful delivery and high-quality user service in Norway also helped us accumulate valuable experience in providing services in other countries and regions and gain confidence in entering more new markets. In 2022, NIO will bring its product and comprehensive services to Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. The team building and market entry preparation are moving forward smoothly. The mass-market brand has been progressing according to plan. We have established the core team specified at the strategic direction and the brand positioning and reached a critical research and development stage of the first batch of products. The development of NIO won't be possible without the continued support of our users. In 2021, 3756 user volunteers contributed their time and efforts in events like auto shows and the NIO Day. More than 12,000 users participated in over 260 charity events to make active contributions to society. At NIO Day 2021, we announced the user partner program with which new users can share benefits with each other and build an even deeper connection among users in the community. In addition, NIO launched the Clean Parks, an ecosystem co-construction initiative. So far, we have rolled out the initiative in six national parks and natural reserves in China. We aim to contribute to ecosystem building, support the adoption of smart electric vehicles and clean energy infrastructure in the natural reserves, and establish a clean and low-carbon energy circulation to protect the authenticity and integrity of ecosystems. 2021 was a year for NIO to develop fundamental powers and make comprehensive preparations for the next stage of development. 2022 is a year for NIO to press ahead at full speed. We will deliver three new products, continue to invest in R&D and infrastructure to improve our long-term competitiveness, expand our production capacity to meet the faster-growing user demand, and serve users in more countries and regions. We will always stay true to our original aspiration of putting users' interests first, make continuous improvements, and deliver products and services beyond user expectations. As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide you the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Steven Feng: Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2021. To be mindful of the length of this call, I encourage listeners to refer to our earlier press release which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenue in the fourth quarter were RMB9.9 billion, or $1.6 billion, representing an increase of 49.1% year-over-year, an increase of 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales, and other sales, because sales in the fourth quarter were RMB9.2 billion or $1.4 billion, accounting for 93% of total revenues in this quarter. It represented an increase of 49.3% year-over-year, an increase of 6.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to high deliveries. The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to a higher average selling price, decrease in subsidization, the use of the co-financing arrangements, and higher deliveries. Other sales in the fourth quarter were RMB0.7 billion or $107.5 million, representing an increase of 46.8% year-over-year and a decrease of 41.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased revenues derived from sales of service and energy packages and accessories in line with the incremental sales as well as increased revenues from used car sales and auto-financing services in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was partially offset by sales of automotive regulatory credits in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the sales of automotive regulatory credits in the third quarter. Cost of sales in the fourth quarter was RMB8.2 billion or $842.8 million, representing an increase of 49.1% year-over-year, an increase of 5% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in cost of sales year-over-year was mainly driven by the increase of delivery volume in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was RMB1.7 billion or $266.7 million, representing an increase of 48.8% year-over-year and a decrease of 14.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in gross profit year-over-year was mainly contributed by increased vehicle sales and increased vehicle margin. The decrease of gross profit quarter-over-quarter mainly resulted from the sales of automotive regulatory credits in the third quarter of 2021 which contributed a higher profit. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 17.2% compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20.3% in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease of gross margin quarter-over-quarter mainly resulted from sales of automotive luxury credit in the third quarter of 2021 which contributed a higher gross margin. More specifically, vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was 20.9% compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 18% in the third quarter of 2021. Increase of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the higher average selling price with higher take rate of 100-kilowatt hour battery. The increase of vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to decrease in subsidization in user vehicle financing arrangements. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB1.83 billion or $286.9 million, representing an increase of 120.5% year-over-year, an increase of 53.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase of R&D expenses quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB2.36 billion or $370.1 million, representing an increase of 95.4% year-over-year, an increase of 29.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the increase in personnel costs in sales and service functions, and costs related to the sales and service network expansion as well as incremental marketing and promotion expenses including for the host of NIO Day in December of 2021. Loss from operations in the fourth quarter was RMB2.45 billion or $383.7 million, representing an increase of 162.5% year-over-year, an increase of 146.5% quarter-over-quarter. Share-based compensation expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB396.7 million or $62.3 million, representing an increase of 559% year-over-year, an increase of 49.4% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in share-based compensation expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily attributed to additional options and restricted shares granted. Net loss in the fourth quarter was RMB2.14 billion or $336.4 million, representing an increase of 54.4% year-over-year, an increase of 156.6% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter was RMB2.179 billion or $342 million, representing an increase of 46.0% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 23.8% from the third quarter of 2021. Basic and diluted net loss per ADS in the fourth quarter were both RMB1.36 or $0.21 per ADS. Excluding share-based compensation expenses and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value, non-GAAP adjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS were both RMB1.07 RMB or $0.16 per ads. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB55.4 billion or $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we achieved positive cash flow for our operating activities for the full year 2021. Now for our business outlook. As William mentioned, for the first quarter of 2022, the Company expects deliveries to be between 25,000 to 26,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 24.6% to 29.6% from the same quarter of 2021. The Company also expects the total revenues of the first quarter of 2022 to be between RMB9.63 billion and RMB9.9 billion or between $1.51 billion and $1.57 billion. This would represent an increase of approximately 20.6% to 25.1% from the same quarter of 2021. This business outlook reflects the Company's current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change. Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. The first question comes from the line of Tim Chau of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, William and Steven and Stanley. Congratulations on this early result and thanks for taking my questions. Basically, I have two questions. The first question is about the cost and margin. Because we know that NIO is better positioned to cope with the battery cost inflation even without a price hike, but may I know if the rising mix of the high-margin 100-kilowatt hour, 75-kilowatt hour hybrid battery pack, or other initiatives could have sufficiently offset a margin prior to this year? Separately, if any, or only if we need to raise the prices one day, could NIO increase the price to the consumers who bought the batteries and also the battery asset management companies simultaneously, or it would take longer to renegotiate a [indiscernible] contract with the battery asset management company as it's more like a 2B business. That's the first question. Second question is about the model. Currently, I think ES6 and ES8 have comprehensively covered the SUV market with pricing range from RMB350,000 to RMB600,000. Since we will soon launch ES7, as William just mentioned, how could we effectively differentiate ES7 from incumbent SUV models without a fall in dilution and are we going to adjust the pricing strategy or reposition current SUV models along with the launch of ES7? Those are the two questions from my side. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Regarding the first question, actually starting from the 41 of last year we started to deliver the 75-kilowatt hour LFP and NCM hybrid battery pack to the users, which has contributed to the cost optimization and benefited our vehicle gross margin growth in the fourth quarter. But I believe everyone knows that starting from the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, we have been seeing some raw material cost increase in the industry, and there has been lots of cost increase in upstream of the whole industry chain which means that we won't need to share the pressure across the whole industry, gradually. At this moment, we do not have any plan to increase our pricing yet, but because during the year we are going to upgrade our product competitiveness and capabilities so at that time probably based on the cost of the raw materials in the industry we will evaluate our pricing strategy as well. But at this moment we're not going to increase our price for the products. On another point, because of the sales growth, we believe this has also contributed to the amortization of the cost and benefit of our vehicle gross margin increase, but regarding the raw material cost increase is not just about the battery but also other commodities like copper and aluminum, those raw material cost increases have also affected our vehicle gross margin as well. In light of the cost increase of those raw materials I have just mentioned and other bond cost, over full year vehicle gross margin for 2022 will still target to reach around 18% to 20%. The second question is about the ES7. This is going to be the first SUV product based on the NT2 and it's positioned as a mid-large five-seater SUV. In this specific segment we have witnessed some user demand increase recently. For example, the BMW X5 we believe is going to start the local production very soon. For the ES7, it's going to have industry leading battery, electro power train and also the smart technologies as well. We believe it's going to showcase the high-performance capabilities of the product and also satisfy users demand in terms of the premiumness and luxury feeling. We also believe this is going to attract users who will have a very high requirement regarding the product quality and the premiumness. So, all in all we believe the ES7 is going to contribute and going to be complementary to other current ES8, ES6 and ET6 instead of affecting the sales of the current products. We are going to launch the ES7 in the second quarter of this year and will share the pricing information as well at that time. At this moment we can see regarding the market segment of the mid/large SUV priced above RMB400,000 is actually has an addressable market size of over 200,000 units. This market size is also growing. That's why we're very confident with the performance of the ES7 after its launch. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. I actually have got a question about the ET7 service because recently there was a media call. First one, EV they say that ET7 received very good order flow, about 15,000 order backlog, which indicate monthly volume could be around 5K. What's your comment about this? Second thing is about the margin, because we've seen in the fourth quarter last year that service actually had very big negative cost margin, more than 30%. What's the reason behind that and what's the outlook of this fixed margin going forward? Meanwhile, you just provided 18% to 20% margin guidance. Is this just the vehicle gross margin or actually including the service margin already? Thank you. Regarding the first question of the ET7, of course we cannot discuss the specific order number at this moment. But what I can say is that it is actually much more than the media report. For the ET7 market segment, we can see some other benchmarks. For example, the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and the Mercedes C-Class. ET7 has the similar pricing as the target group which sells the product as well, especially regarding the BMW 5 Series. So, for BMW 5 Series we can see that the monthly delivery number is around 12,000 to 15,000. Of course, for the ET product it will need some time for the users to adopt and accept but if we look at the examples of the Shanghai market, right now in the premium SUV segment in Shanghai, our market share is around 23%. So, if we also mirror this to the sedan market, we believe there is a lot of room for growth and also potential for our ET7. So, at this moment we cannot see how much we're going to deliver every month, but according to the user feedback we receive right now, we're very confident with the ET7s performance in the future. No, Stanley [Foreign Language] William [Foreign Language] Regarding the ES7, previously I have also mentioned that the ES7 is positioned in the mid-larger premium SUV segment. If we talk about the specific benchmark, we can refer to BMW X5. After the local production of the BMW X5 we can see that the market actually has very high expectations for BMW X5 performance. The current market buy of this segment is over 200,000 units so if we look at the comparables, we can use the BMW X5 as a reference and based on this, we're very confident with our ES7 because we believe it can actually out compete the BMW X5. Okay for the second question, as the service flows, we accelerated the construction of power cell station in 2021 and more power cell station [indiscernible] to provide service to end users, which lead to the cost increase of other revenue other business compared with Q3. In 2022, we will continue to deploy the batteries charging and swapping facilities. Anticipated depreciation of operating expenses will keep rising but we believe the upfront deployment of battery swap stations can contribute to our branding, user experience and also sales with long term value to the Company. So, bearing a short-term loss of power cell station constitutes a strategic decision of the Company. In the long run the cumulative vehicle deliveries going up and the improvement for service efficiency. We expect that the next two margins resulting from power, maintenance and repair service and also other services will gradually improve. Other revenues and margins contributed by innovative business models like BaaS, NIO Life and also [indiscernible] service will keep growing. Okay. The gross profit margin target, 18% to 20% for 2022 is for vehicle, not the overall gross margin. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Ming Hsun Lee of Bank of America. Please go ahead. So my question is regarding the capacity in lidar hybrid battery and also the chip especially if [indiscernible] SHS also announced the chip shortage will cause the price hike. So, I also want to know whether the [indiscernible] chip will constraint your vehicle delivery this year? So regarding the production capacity, previously I have also mentioned that by the middle of this year, our first factory that is the JAC-NIO Manufacturing Centre is going to reach a production cadence across the different workshops. That is around 60 jobs per hour. The designed production capacity of the Factory 2 is also going to be around 60 jobs per hour. Of course, for the Factory 2, because this is a new factory, then we will need some time to ramp up the production gradually. So, if we think about the 60 jobs per hour it means that if we work with 4,000 hours every year, then the annual production capacity is going to be 240,000 units and for every month is around 20,000 units. If we work overtime [indiscernible] to 5,000 hours per year, then it means that the annual production capacity is going to reach around 300,000 units. So, this is about the vehicle production capacity. We believe that in the fourth quarter of this year we will see some fundamental improvements regarding the vehicle production capacity, which is going to support our next step of production. For the battery production capacity bottleneck, yes previously we have also mentioned about this and starting from last year, we have been working together with our partner, CATL, to add additional production lines for the battery cells. We believe, according to the current plan in 2022, the battery production capacity should be able to meet our demand. Of course, the cost increase of the battery is another matter. Actually, I believe the chip shortage is a bigger challenge for us, because in our vehicle we have over 1,000 chips and among those 1,000 chips, we have probably around 10% of the chips may face the supply shortages or challenges from time to time. For us, starting from 2021, we started to see some chip cost increase, and this has affected our vehicle gross margin in 2021. Based on this experience in 2021, we have already taken into consideration of the chip cost increase in terms of setting our target for the vehicle gross margin. We believe the main challenge regarding the chip is more about the supply. Regarding those high-end chips like the Nvidia or ring chips and the Qualcomm 8155 we have a long-term and direct strategic cooperation with Nvidia and Qualcomm. So, we believe we should be able to have sufficient supplies for our production. For those common chips or the cheaper chips, like from TI and Infinium, we may face some challenges from time to time and this is going to affect our production. Of course we have some other ways to mitigate those challenges. For example we can find some other chips to replace those chips or we can probably scan the market to build up our strategic inventory to avoid those risks. We believe, overall speaking, in the second half of this year or around the fourth quarter of this year we should be able to see some fundamental improvement in terms of our vehicle production capacity and the battery production capacity. But we may still face some challenges in terms of the supply chain volatility especially the semiconductors. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Chung of Citi. Please go ahead. I've got three questions. So number one is should we consider any MSRP hike in the near term to offset potential battery and aluminum cost hike? If yes, how and if no, why not? The second question is about the existing EC6 product sales volume visibility over the next few months. Any confidence we can maintain 10,000 units a month as well as the -- could you give us more color on the ET7 ramp-up pace in the second quarter? Last but not least is the lithium spot price in China. Do you think it has already peaked due to the recent government intervention? Thank you. For the current ES8, ES6 and EC6 of course if we look at the digital [indiscernible] this is actually based on the NIO Technology Platform 1.0 which was developed in 2018. So for this chip the efficiency may be impaired if we run some complicated software. So that's why starting from this year we think this year we are going to upgrade to the smart hardware of our existing products. We are also going to provide after-sales upgrade services for users regarding the smart hardware upgrades. We are going to launch this program at an appropriate time. For the existing ES8, ES6 and EC6 we believe we do not need to adjust the pricing at this moment. But of course based on the smart hardware upgrade of the existing products and also we are going to launch some model year product, then at that time we believe probably we can re-evaluate our pricing strategy based on the cost increase in the supply chain. You have also asked about the performance of our current product, whether it should be able to still maintain the 10,000 units per month. According to our order momentum in March we believe that this can meet our expectations and we believe that user demand is not a problem for us because if we compare over current years ADS6 and EC6 with other ED products and ICE products in the market, we believe we still have a lot of competitive advantages so the overall demand momentum stays quite strong. For the ET7 product ramp-up, because the ET7 is going to be manufactured in the first factory we called F1 and they're going to share the production line with the current product ES8, ES6 and EC6, at the same time we will also introduce some new manufacturing technologies and techniques in the production of ET7. So that's why, starting from last year, we started to adjust the production lines in the F1 to support the new product production. In the meantime, I have also mentioned about the ES7 which is going to start delivery in the third quarter of this year. This product is also going to be manufactured in the F1. So, the situation in F1 is quite complicated as you can see because we need to make sure we have sufficient production capacities to support the current ES8, ES6 and EC6 but at the same time, we also need to produce the ET7 and also prepare for the production of the ES7. So that's why we believe the ramp-up progress of the ET7 is probably going to be a little bit slower compared with that of the ET5. So, it seems ET5 is going to be manufactured in a separate new plant called F2. So, we believe that probably around the third quarter of this year, we should be able to reach a normal production cadence for the ET7. Regarding the lithium carbonate cost increase, we have done very in-depth research regarding the overall industry chain especially the upstream. We believe the cost increase or the price hikes is mainly due to the opportunistic price hikes and there is no specific big gaps in terms of the demand and the supply of the lithium carbonate materials. Of course, right now, we can see some Chinese authorities like MIIT have already started to set up some mechanisms to manage the situation. At the same time, we also like to urge the companies in the upstream of the industry chain that they should think more from the long-term benefit of the overall development of the whole industry instead of manipulate or take the opportunity of the cost increases to increase their price. Thank you for the questions. Next question comes from the line of Nick Lai of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you for taking my question. Two simple questions. First on margin and the second on export business. I mean, William and [indiscernible] talk about the GP margin already. Let me switch focus to the OP margin. Yes. Last year, we understand the R&D spend and assume an increase, a lot, in part, largely part due -- largely due to the top line increase. So, looking to 2022, how should we think about SG&A and R&D expense in terms of either dollar terms or percentage to revenue? Is it fair to state RMB percentage to revenue should increase - should drop meaningfully while SG&A should move more or less in tandem with the top-line sales? The second question is regarding ASPOR. I understand it's probably not a big portion of auto total sales but considering the latest dynamic in Europe and advising stronger revenue against either dollar or Euro, any update on ASPOR front? Thanks. Regarding the OP margin, last year in terms of the Company's strategy, we would like to make sure that the gross profit can cover the SG&A cost, and we believe through the efficiency improvement and execution we have followed through this strategy in 2021. In the coming years, we will continue to make decisive investments in terms of the R&D and the infrastructure. Of course, our strategy will stay the same; that is, we would like to make sure we can use the gross profit to cover the SG&A costs. If we look at the EU market, of course last year, because that was the first year for us to enter the global market, then it means that last year we need to make some advance investment and we believe this year the efficiency is much higher than last year. In terms of the R&D front, we are going to step up our R&D investments. This year we believe the R&D investment is going to be more than doubling than that of 2021 because we are going to invest in some long-term core technologies and some fundamental technologies as well as the new products for 2023 as well as some product adaptation for the global market. By the yearend of 2022 our R&D headcount is going to reach around 9000 and we believe this is going to be a big increase compared with our current R&D team size. This is the overall plan for the 2022. In terms of the overall strategic direction for the Company, our target is that we can achieve breakeven for a single quarter in the fourth quarter of 2023, and we can achieve breakeven or reach profitability in 2024 for the full year. The second question is about our global business, right? No, actually right now every month we deliver about 108 in Norway, so that boosts our confidence a lot, it proves our product's competitive and also our business model. However, since we will kick off our SUV in Europe in the second half of this year, so the contribution of the European market to sales volume won't be very significant in this year. But now on, NIO continues to develop and improve its product portfolio and service network, establish local user communities, and pursue a high user satisfaction. With that we believe that market share and sales volume in Europe will come along naturally. Allow me to take the next questions from Fei Fang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Let me just quickly translate for myself. Can management talk a little bit about the utilization metrics of your infrastructure, battery swap stations, and Supercharger stations, how often people use it, what's the unit economics, or what's the difference between top cities versus lower-tier cities? Thank you. Previously, we have also mentioned that cumulatively we have completed over 7.6 million swaps, and it means that the current status for the swap station is that every day we can complete around 30,000 swaps. For some areas with more users of course we will be able to accommodate over 1000 swaps for one power swap station in one day, but highways probably in one day the power swap station is going to accommodate around 10 to 20 swaps per power swap station. Because we have deployed the power swap station network in advance, probably one or two years in advance, because of the design target of the power swap station network is that the ratio between the power swapper to the user should be around 1 to 1000. But if we look at our parent power network, especially for the power swap network, we have over-deployed some power swap stations at this moment to make sure we have a much better experience for the users. Certainly. Next question comes from the line of Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thank you for taking our questions. First one, can you give us some sense of the feature rollout cadence in the autonomous driving? What kind of features do you think the LiDAR will enable and when can we expect those to arrive on the car? And then the second question is about the NIO ecosystem more broadly speaking. There are reports that you're working on a smartphone. How do we think about what's going on beyond the car? I know there's - VR could be a big part. Any [indiscernible] would be appreciated. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Of course, and the timing of the delivery of the ET7 we are going to start to provide the enhanced ADMS features first to the users. But on top of that, we have already queued up the full stack of autonomous driving capabilities from the perception to the controlling strategy. We target to start providing the AD as a service probably in the fourth quarter of this year with our NAD technology. Of course we have always been actively -- explore the possible connections and the synergies between the vehicle and smart phones and other mobile terminals because we believe there are lots of synergies between these two products in terms of the fundamental technologies, the supply chain and the software. At the launch of the ET5 at the NIO Day, we have also introduced some AR and VR technologies as well and we believe there should be lots of room for innovation and we can also think about some innovative applications in the vehicles. Thank you for the questions. Next question will come from the line of Xue Deng from CICC. Please go ahead. So my next question is, what's the CapEx budget in 2022 and will you please introduce the detail about the main directions and the exact amount of money? Thank you. Thank you Deng Xue. Yes, as mentioned by William, our gross profit margin already can cover our SG&A expense and this is also our target for 2022. So, our cash on hand will mainly be used for our R&D activities and also capital expenditures for our new product developments and production facilities, service network and expansion and also the charging and working infrastructures. Overall, also as mentioned in our previous explanations, we will increase our swap stations to 1300 stations by the end of 2022. We will further open 100 new house and new space and 60 new service centers -- 50 new service centers in 2022. So, and we will further to -- construct our NeoPark, located in Hefei, in 2022. So, the total expenditure I think is over -- could be a big increase compared with 2021. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the questions. The next question comes from the line of Paul Gong from UBS. Please go ahead. Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Glad I still have a chance to ask how you went at this late moment. Let me just limit my question to one. I want to know more about your thoughts about the mass market brands. Obviously, you have to compromise some of the features that NIO has for more attractive pricing points or some cost comparatives. So, the amount of the features for the new offering including say the exterior, the interior, the advanced driving features, the acceleration, the driving range, the battery swap stations, as well as let's say the digital experience and also the service. So, what do you think is the things that you are waiting to compromise on your mass market brands that would be reserved exclusively for the NIO brands and you're not expecting from the mass market brands? Just this question. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Of course, if we want to increase our volume and expand our user base, different companies will have very different strategies. For example, some peers like Tesla, they have adopted very different strategies compared with ours. For Tesla, they basically differentiated the Model 3 and Model Y from the Model X and Model S with a very big price gap. So, by doing this they entered the mass market with the Model 3 and Model Y. So far this has been quite successful, but at the same time we have also seen some downside. For example, the sales of the Model X and Model Y have decreased significantly despite the product cycle. So, we believe there are some underlying fundamental rules of the auto industry. That is, there is a limited bandwidth of a specific brand. It's very difficult to imagine a single brand can actually support the pricing range from RMB100,000 to RMB1 million. It's not feasible and I believe this is against the common sense. So, for NIO right now, we target the market segment that is around $50,000 to $100,000 and if we want to reach down to the mainstream market, that is priced around $30,000 to $50,000. We believe this is a much bigger market and there is reasonable market size for us to grow and we can also achieve reasonable growth margin. We also need to take some lessons learnt from the Model 3 and Model Y. We understand of course, for this mass market, we will also need to rethink the fundamental architecture of our product and also need to think about using different kind of materials and also different manufacturing technologies for our products. In terms of the mass market of course there also needs to be efficiency driven. For this specific market segment, priced from $30,000 to $50,000 we believe a more sensible approach versus to use a new brand to enter this new market segment. We believe this is a better strategy for us. We can also see some successful examples in the market with this strategy. For example, Audi and Volkswagen and the Lexus and Toyota. We believe this can also be a strategy for us to disrupt the market as well. Of course, for the mass market brands, the prerequisite for this is to make sure we can achieve high efficiency and also achieve reasonable vehicle gross margin. Thank you for the questions. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to the Company for closing remarks. Eve Tang: Thank you once again for joining us today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.
In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered 25,768 premium smart electric vehicles, another record quarter with a growth of 37.6% year-over-year.
Since the second half of March, new wave of coronavirus outbreaks in certain regions in China has impacted our vehicle production and deliveries. In April and May, we delivered 5,074 and 7,024 vehicles, respectively. Starting from June, while the supply chain and the vehicle production have basically returned to normal, our vehicle deliveries have also gotten back on track in Shanghai and several other important markets. We will continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to further improve the overall supply chain production capacity and accelerate vehicle delivery. We expect the total delivery in the second quarter of 2022 to be between 23,000 to 25,000 units.
Despite the outbreak, our products have continued to witness a robust demand. Our order intake stayed strong, especially for ET7 and reached a new high in May. We believe the launch of new products will drive continuous order growth. In the meantime, governments at all levels in China have also introduced a positive policy to encourage vehicle consumption and purchase of electric vehicles. This will further promote the up trading and new purchase of premium smart electric vehicles. Going forward, we will further increase the overall supply chain production capacity and we are confident of ramping up of our deliveries at a much faster pace in the second half of this year.
In terms of vehicle gross margin, the whole industry is faced with the rising cost of batteries from materials and chips which has also affected our vehicle margin. In the first quarter, our vehicle margin stood at 18.1%. As the battery cost continued to surge and peaked in April, the vehicle margin in the second quarter will be under even higher pressure. To mitigate the impact of the rising material costs, we have taken a series of countermeasures such as adjusting product prices. With the deliveries of new products, higher revenue per vehicle and increasing production output, we expect the vehicle margin to start bouncing back from the third quarter.
On May 20, 2022, NIO was listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange, which marks another important milestone of NIO. With that, we have further enhanced our footing in the global capital markets which led us to better connect with the investors and serve investors from around the world.
It is also of great significance for our global business development.
In addition, according to the announcement made by the Hang Seng Indexes Co. Limited, NIO will be included in the Hang Seng Tech Index and the Hang Seng Composite Index starting from June 13.
Next, I would like to share with you some updates on our recent operations and R&D.
Research and development of new products and core technologies has been one of NIO's long-term strategic focuses. We have been making positive progresses on various related fronts.
On March 28, we started to deliver ET7 with extraordinary handling and the riding experience has been well recognized by the users and the media. Since the delivery of ET7, we have made fast iterations and released more smart features via portal updates on a continuous basis. We have introduced over 200 new features on the NT2.0 platform with the next-generation voice interaction and emotion engine technologies. NOMI's interactive experience is comprehensively upgraded. The driver assistance system powered by NIO's full stack in-house algorithm has achieved outstanding performance in external reviews and [indiscernible].
In the third quarter, we will release NOP plus based on the HD Map co-developed with our partner, enabled by the powerful software and hardware platform, full stack in-house algorithm and end-to-end pursuit data collection and operations capabilities. NT2.0 is capable of fast iteration and upgrades, laying a solid foundation for releasing NEV services in more scenarios and providing the autonomous driving experience beyond expectations.
On April 29, the first ET5 tooling trial builds roll off the production line in F2 at NeoPark. The team is working towards the final stage of mass production of ET5 and the delivery is expected to start this September.
This month, we will unveil ES7, a brand new, mid-to-large, five-seater SUV based on the NT2.0, and we'll start the delivery in late August.
We will continue to step up our investments in battery-related, too. As of now, we have over 400 employees working on battery-related technologies, including battery materials, cell and pack design, battery management systems and manufacturing processes. We aim to build and enhance our comprehensive battery R&D and industrialization capabilities to improve the competitiveness and the profitability of our products in the long run.
With regards to production, F1 has fully resumed capacity to the level before the recent outbreak. In addition, we will further ramp up the production output on a gradual basis to support the mass production of the new products.
NIO F2 at NeoPark has completed the production line installation and tooling and has entered into the production validation phase. It will be put into operation from the third quarter this year. It only took us 12 months from kicking off construction to rolling off the first tooling trial build in F2 which is a record construction speed in the industry.
In terms of the sales and service network, we now have 381 new houses and new spaces in 152 cities as well as 247 new service centers and delivery centers in 149 cities worldwide.
With regards to charging and swapping network, we've installed over 960 battery swapping stations in 197 cities. So far, we have 829 supercharging stations and 1,140 destination chargers.
The continued deployment of our sales, service and the power network will bring long-term benefits to our brand awareness, user satisfaction rate and the sales growth.
With respect to the global market, while further expanding our sales and service network and improving the user satisfaction in Norway, our teams have been accelerating preparations to launch our products and services in Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.
In terms of our mass market brands, our product development and production preparation are in steady progress. On May 10, NIO signed a strategic corporation agreement with Hefei on the second phase of vehicle production plant and the facilities for key components at NeoPark. The agreement marks the start of the planning and preparation of the production capacity of the new brand.
NIO's originate strong vision fueled with the blue sky. We are fully committed to making continuous investments in environmental protection and social welfare and contributing to global sustainable development.
Since we announced the Clean Parks, a global ecosystem construction initiative last December, NIO has been actively cooperating with several organizations to roll out various projects to support national parks and natural reserves. On April 22, NIO reached a strategic cooperation with Worldwide Fund for nature who has joined hands with us in establishing a clean and low-carbon energy separation system in national parks and natural reserves in China and beyond.
Although we went through many challenges in the first half of 2022, 2022 is still a critical year for NIO to make committed investments and efforts in new products, core technologies, global market entry and the mass market brand. In the second half of this year, we will accelerate our new product delivery and the capacity expansion. We are confident of and look forward to realizing satisfying results in 2022.
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the quarter. Steven, please go ahead. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I will refer to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online, for additional details.
Our total revenues in the first quarter were RMB9.9 billion, representing increase of 24.2% year-over-year and remained stable quarter-over-quarter.
Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicles sales in the first quarter were RMB9.2 billion, representing an increase of 24.8% year-over-year and remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. Increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher delivery.
Other sales in the first quarter were RMB0.7 billion, representing an increase of 15.6% year-over-year and remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased sales of service and energy packages and others in line with the incremental vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2022 which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from battery upgrade services.
Gross margin in the first quarter was 14.6% compared with 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021 and 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to the decrease of vehicle margin and reduction in other sales margins resulting from expanded investment in our service network. The decrease of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the decrease of vehicle margin.
More specifically, vehicle margin in the first quarter was 18.1% compared with 21.2% in the first quarter of 2021 and 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly driven by the lower average selling price due to changes in our product mix. The decrease of vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased battery cost per unit.
R&D expenses in the first quarter were RMB1.76 billion, representing an increase of 156% year-over-year and remained stable quarter-over-quarter. The increase of R&D expenses year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as for incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.
G&A expenses in the first quarter were RMB2.01 billion, an increase of 68.3% year-over-year and a decrease of 14.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily due to the increase in personnel costs in sales and service functions and costs related to the sales and service network expansion. The decrease in SG&A expenses quarter-over-quarter are mainly attributed to the decrease of marketing and promotion expenses -- marketing and promotion expenses incurred from the hosting of NIO Day in December 2021 as well as decrease of professional services expenses.
Loss from operations in the first quarter was RMB2.19 billion, representing an increase of 639.7% year-over-year and decrease of 10.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss in the first quarter was RMB1.78 billion, representing an increase of 295.3% year-over-year and decrease of 16.8% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the first quarter was RMB1.83 billion, representing a decrease of 62.6% year-over-year and a decrease of 16.3% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB53.3 billion as of March 31, 2022.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Chung from Citi. Please ask your question. So I have two questions. One is the second quarter GP margin outlook. So it looked like the high-margin products as a percentage of sales in the second quarter could reach about 37% versus 17% in the first quarter. I think this is one of the positives that may potentially lift up the GP margin trend.
And secondly is that there has been some MSRP hike recently. And we would like to know how much of the sales volume from the second quarter has been a price hike versus the first quarter. Obviously, this is the first question.
And the second question is that our new model cycle suggests that our current aging products, three products, is going to turn into six new products into the next 6 to 12 months. So my question is whether the third quarter production capacity can reach above 48,000 units since, by referring to Tesla, we saw a strong week-on-week and month-on-month recovery from the past weeks. And my understanding is that a lot of our supply, auto part suppliers are overlapped with the Tesla. So, if Tesla recover fast would that mean that we are going to enjoy the similar pace into June and the third quarter? Thank you for your question, Jeff. Starting from April, we actually updated our agreement with our battery supplier CATL. And right now, our battery cost is connected with the raw material indexes. So basically, it means that if in the second quarter we can see the battery cost is going to significantly increase compared with that of the first quarter, and this is going to affect of vehicle gross margin performance, but there's going to be some latencies.
The battery prices increase in the prior month is going to be reflected in the battery cost of the later months and this is going to incorporate it into offer bigger gross margin performance. According to the current forecast and the market trend, we can see the battery cost is going down a little bit starting from May and we have also taken some measures, for example, increasing our product prices. This is going to help us improve our performance in the third quarter.
Right now, we are still delivering vehicles without the price adjustment and we expect to start to deliver the vehicles with the price adjustment starting from the third quarter because our business model is made to order or order to delivery.
So just now you have also mentioned that our products with higher gross margin is also going to kick in, in terms of the performance of the vehicle gross margin. Just as the ET7 that is launched in the second quarter and we expect the production of ET7 is going to gradually ramp up starting from June. And then starting from the third quarter is going to maintain at a normal level.
Overall speaking, we believe our vehicle gross margin is going to face a higher pressure in the second quarter. So this is mainly due to the battery cost impact. The vehicle gross margin of the second quarter is going to be lower compared with that of the first quarter. But with the price adjustment, we expect we are going to start to deliver the vehicles with higher prices starting from the third quarter which is going to contribute to our vehicle gross margin.
With the production capacity expansion in the F1, we expect that this is going to start to improve the overall production output starting from June. Of course, it will need some time to gradually ramp up the production, but we believe the vehicle production is not going to be a bottleneck. And the demand is not an issue for us. The main challenges that we're facing right now is the supply chain, especially in terms of the chipset and also the production capacity of our suppliers. We are very confident of our delivery performance starting from the third quarter. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. So let me translate my questions. The first question is about orders. So could you please provide further details? Do order ET7 dominate the current order intake while the demand for carbon SUV are falling more meaningful? And are we going to have say on our current SUV model in time soon? And you mentioned the record order book does that include the orders of ET5?
My second question is about batteries. Because during the presentation, I think William mentioned, NIO now has more than 400 related -- battery-related technology covering cell, pack, BMS and more. Will NIO consider evolving more in battery production over time? Or seek for fashionable battery OEMs vendors help to produce the battery base on NIO's home patents and the technology? So those are my two questions. Thank you, Tim, for your question. Regarding your first question for order, basically, in May, our order growth is quite significant and this actually includes the order intake for the existing ES8, ES6 and EC6. The overall order intake performance of the existing ES8, ES6 and EC6 is quite steady and we have witnessed certain growth.
You have also mentioned whether we are planning for some upgrades of our very existing models? We are planning for incorporating some smart hardware and some new software features for the upgraded version of the existing models.
After we launched the ET5 in last year's NIO Day, we have witnessed the steady growth of the order intake. Recently, because of the auto shows and exhibitions, we have witnessed a very positive order performance of ET5.
Just now, for the 400, this is actually about the R&D teams focusing on the battery technologies. We have over 400 employees. For this, we plan to leverage our R&D capabilities in terms of the battery to launch an 800-volt high-voltage battery pack which will also support the battery swapping technologies in 2024. We understand that this is going to bring many innovative technologies and revolutional solutions. We believe that this unified pack concept is going to redefine the battery technologies in terms of the battery cost and the battery safety.
Our plan right now is to start the production of this new next-generation battery pack in the second half of 2024. Our long-term battery strategy is going to be a combination of in-house production and also outsourcing. We believe that this long-term strategy is going to benefit the overall competitiveness and the vehicle gross margin as well as the profitability of NIO's products. This is also going to be of [Technical Difficulty]. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. I actually want to quantify the margin because you actually said that second quarter will be a low margin. Can you say what's the level of the decline in margin because you actually raised the price for current by around RMB10,000. Can you notice the decline in the gross profit margin across product just RMB10,000? You also mentioned that in the third quarter we're back to normal. What's the back to normal are you referring to? You referred to 18% gross margin in the first quarter or an after peak level of around 21%. Meanwhile, I suppose you will further increase the price for the upcoming battery semiconductor intention corporate version of content product. Is that going to be another increase in the gross margin? Thank you, Bin, for your question. Regarding the price increases for our products, previously, I have also explained that this is going to be reflected in our vehicle gross margin in the third quarter because right now we are still delivering vehicles without the adjusted price.
For the second quarter, the battery cost is higher than that of the first quarter, but the impact of this is still uncertain. Specifically, we believe it's going to be higher than the RMB10,000 you have just mentioned. But we believe there's still many uncertainties that we need to weigh out a little bit because, just like I mentioned, right now, the battery cost of products is actually based on the raw material trends and the index.
So it means that for the third quarter, we will probably see some trends of the raw material cost going down a little bit. And with our vehicle gross margin improvement based on the new technology platform 2.0, the vehicle gross margin in the third quarter, we believe it's going to bounce back. But there are still many uncertainties because the battery cost is very difficult to forecast and to determine at this moment. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America. Please ask your question. My first question, could you also give us some guidance regarding your potential product pipeline for 2023, especially for the A66. Will you consider to launch the new generation next year?
Second question is regarding your services others business. First, revenue starting kind of Q-on-Q, is it because of COVID impact? And secondly, gross margin of this business is also not very good for the quarter. It's also -- is this because of the lower utilization when you build a new battery swap station? And what do we expect the margin improvement for this business? Thank you, Ming, for your question. Of course, for the existing models, including the ES8, ES6 and the EC6, our plan is to upgrade all those models to the platform in the next year. Ming, this is Stanley. The other operating loss mainly because the increase in depreciation and also operating expenses related to our power swap stations; and in this year, we will continue to build the battery charging and swapping network, which can bring the unique experience to our users and can benefit the further improvement of our user satisfaction and also brand image.
So from a short term, I think the other loss will increase along with the expansion of the network. And from the long run, the numbers of the delivery and also users grow, we will make our charging service -- charging and swapping services more efficient.
The losses arising from the charging and swapping service will gradually narrow down. And our innovative business models, including NIO Life and also ADAS, can also bring extra gross profit and booked in this account. Thanks, Ming. Thank you. The next question comes from Nick Lai from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Let me explain very quickly my two questions. First is regarding supply chain. Can you give us an update on supply condition in June as well as second half as well as the pricing with battery supplier. Has recent price hike reflect the cost increase in the first half and will battery cost continue to rise in the second half? Are we going to revise our price again in the second half as well so? And second, a quick update on our mid-market brand strategy? Thank you. Yes. Thank you for your question. There are many uncertainties in terms of the chip supply. Because in our vehicle we probably have over 1,000 chips and the chip shortage situation for those 1,000 chips may vary from time to time. And this is totally depends on the upstream suppliers of the Tier 1 suppliers of NIO.
Many of the chip shortage is actually caused by the basic chipsets used by those Tier 1 suppliers or the upstream suppliers of those Tier 1 suppliers. For example, like TI and Infineon, they provide various kind of chips to OEMs and it's very difficult to actually identify specific risky chips that we are going to face the shortage. That is why we do have a risky chip list. Normally, it includes probably around 1 to 20 different kind of chips and this list may change month to month. Of course, we will try to mitigate all those risks with different kind of measures.
Previously, our plan is to expand our production capacity starting from the second half of this year. So that's why starting from last year, we have already started to work closely with all our suppliers to make sure we can secure sufficient supplies for our products.
We have some risks in terms of the chip supply, but we believe this is actually manageable and is under control. For the production capacity of the -- in the month of June, this is actually not specifically related to the chip shortage or other supply chain rates because this is just a part of the normal ramp-up process for the production capacity expansion.
Regarding the second question of the battery, starting from April, our battery cost is linked together with the raw materials of the batteries in the market. We can see the raw material costs actually picked in April, and we started to see some trend of going down, specifically for the lithium carbonate. In China, we have already started to see there are more resources for the lithium and there are some companies trying to mine the lithium to make sure they can supply to the market and meet the demand. So I believe the general consensus of the industry already peaked in April. So it's going to gradually go down.
But of course, people have a different forecast in terms of what is going to be the final cost of those raw materials. Some people may think that the lithium carbonate is going to go down to around probably 30,000 per ton. This means that we are going to reduce the cost of the lithium carbonate by 20% to 30%. And we also have a similar forecast for the nickel material as well. So we believe the general trend is the cost of those battery materials is going down, but -- and it's not going to go up again.
The next question is about the mass market brand. Our plan is to start the delivery of the products of the mass market brand starting from the second half of 2024. This product is going to be based on the new technology platform 3.0. And we believe the mainstream products of the mass market brand is going to be at the price range from 200,000 to 300,000. Of course, the mass market brand products will also support battery swapping and we are going to use our in-house development and manufacture the batteries for the mass market brand product.
Of course, this platform is going to support high-voltage technologies. And we believe with all those advanced technologies and the competitive pricing, those products under the mass market brands are going to be very competitive. Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. Please ask your question. Let me translate my questions. The first question is related to ES7. Why from unveiling launch until delivery, it seems to be a lot faster than the previous ET7 or ET5? And how do you think about the cannibalization versus ES8, ES6 and EC6 given they are all kind of SUVs of similar size?
My second question is regarding the supply chain preparation for the NT.2 platform. Currently, it seems that the ET7 production remains to be relatively slow in terms of power with pretty long waiting period. In view, we are going to have an ET5 with major volume and ES7 in the pipeline. Have we done enough work to secure the key components supply to enable the ramp-up of the overall NT.2 platform models? Thank you, Paul, for your question. Regarding the first question, we have always been working on the development of our new products and we have been working on the development of the ES7 for some time. And the launch time of the ES7 is actually already planned when we were developing the product.
It may seem right now is very close to the delivery of the ES7. But previously our plan is to launch the ES7 earlier. Due to the impact of the COVID-19, we delayed a little bit. That is why it seems that the -- it's much closer to the actual delivery of the ES7. But everything is actually going forward according to our plan.
ES7 is going to be based on the new technology platform 2.0, which is going to be offering higher and smarter technologies compared with the current NT.2 -- NT.1 technology platform. So -- and the current ES8, ES6 and EC6 are actually based on the NT.1 technology platforms.
There will also be some price differences. The price positioning of the ES7 is going to be between that of the ES8 and ES6.
We believe that there is not going to be cannibalizations between the ES7 and the existing models because we have different positioning and pricing strategies for those products. For example, the ES8 is mainly focusing on the six-seater and seven-seater markets. And the ES7 is positioned as a mid-to-large, five-seater SUV, which has higher pricing compared with that of the ES6.
For the second question, of course we have already and actually started at a very early stage to plan for the production ramp-up of the products based on the NT.2 platform. And we have already done this for some time. Of course, there are going to be some risks, but because we have planned ahead, we believe, it is still manageable. Thank you. Our next question comes from Yuqian Ding from HSBC. Please go ahead. So I've got two questions. First is to ask about whether our price hike in May is enough to cover the cost headwind from the battery side, aluminum body and also the chip alignment in the channel? And what's the management thoughts about the actual cost and also the pricing strategy coming forward?
And second question is to ask about ET5 volume and margin conviction. We know there's a bit of auto splash on the entry luxury, which is the currently ET7 has been located within the segment. And also, previously, we have designed 20% above margin. But back in time, we haven't considered -- we might not consider the cost headwind coming from the commodity side might persist longer. [Foreign Language] Yuqian, this is Stanley. For cost increase of battery, I think William has, give us a lot of guidance. And regarding the price increase of other material and also chip cost, I think we have absorbed through close cooperation with our partners and also internal efficiency improvements.
And also, as William introduced, the whole market for the key raw materials are quite dynamic. At this moment, we cannot give the precise like estimation of the following months or quarters, the trend. So, for the second question, William. For the ET5, because we have already accumulated a significant amount of reservation orders, so if we consider the production of the ET5, we believe, for this year, the production of ET5 will only be sufficient to meet the backlog for the ET5 orders. So this price increase of the ET5 is not going to have any impact of our vehicle gross margin performance this year. Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please ask your question. I have quick two questions. On your in-house capacity with Hefei, you have talked about 240,000 annual capacity. Do you think you get to that 20,000 a month run rate by end of Q3 of this year, Q3 '22?
And the second question is on the NeoPark, that obviously has an incremental additional 300,000 per year capacity. You talked about ramp, starting that in Q3. Can you walk through how that ramp should look? Will it be like 10,000 a month exiting this year and then gradually increase next year? That's it. [Foreign Language] Okay. So Vijay, thanks for your question. For the production capacity of our first plant with JAC-NIO, as we have mentioned, we will continue to ramp up its production capacity in Q3. I think probably at least in the second half of the year, our overall plant capacity should reach 20,000 units per month. It can be -- it's not probably too hard for us to see when.
And then for the F2's ramp-up pace, actually, first, we will kick off the delivery of ET5 from this plant in Q3. So it will start production in Q3 and that we try to reach 10,000 units within quite a short period, probably three, four months. I think that's our plan.
Of course, next year, as we introduce more models into this factory, the overall production volume of F2 will continue to rise. Thank you. Our next question comes from Xing Chang from CICC. Please ask your question. My first question is about it was reported that in May that we have relevant recruitment information in the United States. So can you share more details about it? How do you see the breakthroughs in overseas market, which potential market we think have more potential for us to deployment and what are the difficulties?
And my second question is about NAD. Can you share more details about its current testing progress? [Foreign Language] Okay. And Chang Xing, thank you for your question. So first, with regard to the U.S. market, the short answer is we'll definitely enter the U.S. market. And actually, we've started a comprehensive study of the U.S. market and have a dedicated team in charge of the business plan for the market. We're talking to the U.S. market with innovative manner, but now it's still in the study phase. So, we'll share more information when it's appropriate.
And also then for the difficulties or difference in the laws in European market, first actually with a lot of energies between China and the European market from the bus model to the aspiration for green smart EV products. The Norwegian users also enjoy the concept of smart EV and even the price.
But if we do need to name some difference, of course, first, the culture and also the cost structure. So in Europe, surely, the delivery cost would be higher. And also, we need to be -- accumulate enough understanding of the local culture and get integrated into the local community.
William, back to you. For the second question regarding NAD, the current ADAS functions and features based on the NIO technology platform 2.0 is actually derived from the full stack technologies developed in-house by our own AD teams. We have a comprehensive full stack capabilities starting from sensing algorithm and control strategy.
Starting from the delivery of the ET7 on March 28, we have witnessed the data closed loop management and collection, which has helped us to achieve a very fast iteration and upgrades of the vehicle autonomous driving or ADAS experiences based on the NT.2.
So for us, we have witnessed many improvements in the last two months because we can collect our data and we can actually see all those data we can see that the performance of the NT.2 is actually several times better than that of the NT.1 Because after we collect all those data, we can use the data to train our algorithm and our ADAS and AD technologies.
So, I have also just mentioned that we're going to release the NOP plus. We are very confident with the performance of the NOP plus. This NOP plus is going to be based on the high-definition map developed together by ourselves together with Tencent. And this is going to be an in-house high-definition map.
We are going to integrate all those different technologies, including the high-definition map, with our AD and ADAS closed loop data management. So we are going to use the same kind of technology stack to improve our autonomous driving and ADAS features. That is why we are very confident with the NAD performance in the long-run based on our sensing capabilities the closed loop data management and also fast iterations and the systematic capabilities. Thank you very much for all your questions. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to the management team for closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website.

NIO delivered a total of 25,069 vehicles in Q2 2022, representing a 14.4% increase year-over-year. In July and August 2022, NIO delivered 10,052 and 10,677 vehicles, respectively, marking increases of 26.7% and 81.6% year-over-year. During this period, the company's vehicle production and delivery were faced with the challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather conditions and supply chain uncertainties. We will work closely with all our supply chain partners to further accelerate the production and delivery of our vehicles. Benefiting from the continued demand growth for premium electric vehicles and new outstanding product and service competitiveness, we believe the vehicle deliveries will witness robust growth in the second half of 2022. The delivery and production ramp-up of ET7, ES7 and ET5 based on the NT2 platform. Hence the upgraded 2022 ES8, ES6 and EC6, we expect the total delivery in the third quarter of 2022 to be between 31,000 to 33,000 units. In terms of our financial performance, despite the significant increase in battery costs in Q2, the vehicle gross margin reached 16.7%, contributed by the deliveries of ET7 with high specifications. Part of the orders with adjusted prices and refined management of a sales policy. Next, I would like to share some recent key highlights of our R&D and operations. At NIO, the first products based on the NT2 platform, the ET7, has demonstrated strong product competitiveness in the mid-large premium sedan segment, with its industry-leading software and hardware platforms and the smart digital experience. On June 15, NIO launched the ES 7 of mid-large 5-seater SUV based on the NT2 platform, inheriting NIO’s high-performance DNA, the ES7 both autonomous driving, handling and the safety performance, creating comfort and the intelligent experiences beyond the expectations. In addition, ES7 offers an electric so far as an option, enabling a new outdoor experience with a touring caravents. Since the start of the user test drive in August, the ES7 has been well received in the market and kicked off deliveries at scale starting from August 28. We have also launched the 2022 ES8, ES6 and EC6 fitted with the new digital system order, with comprehensively enhance the perception unit and computing power. The 3 products offer richer digital corporate experience and have strengthened their competitiveness in the market. The mass production preparation of the ET5 and midsize smart electric sedan based on NT2 is also in full swing, while its performance and configuration have been further optimized and enhanced compared with those at the time of the product launch. With pure and progressive design ultimate performance and outstanding intelligent experience, the comprehensive competitiveness of the ET5 far surpasses the peers in the same segment. We're confident that ET5 will become one of the most popular midsized premium sedans. The production order confirmation of ET5 will start from September 9, and the first batch will be delivered to users on September 30. With regards to digital systems, we released the Banyan 1.1.0 based on NT2 in August with over 60 new features and optimizations. In terms of the digital corporate and the driving experience, this update has introduced more modes under the parking scenario, diversified the audio and video experience in the cabin and further optimize the suspension comfort and the vehicle handling. In the aspect of the advanced driver assistance system, we have further upgraded the environment simulation display and automatic emergency braking, which has to enhance the action experience and driving safety for the users. As for production, we rolled the first batch of ET5 preproduction vehicles off the production lines at NIO’s Factory 2 at NIO Park, and we plan to start the mass production this month. With regards to sales and service network, we now have 395 new houses and new spaces in 149 cities across the globe and 263 new service centers and delivery centers covering 151 cities in the world. In terms of the charging and swapping network, we have built an expressway power swapping network, covering 5 verticals and 3 horizontal expressways and 4 metropolitan areas in China. We have installed 1,094 swap stations, including 285 situated by the express ways and completed over 12 million battery swaps for our users. At the same time, we have deployed 1,873 power charger stations, including 5,341 power chargers and 5,466 destination charges and connected with more than 5,600 third-party charges, offering over 860,000 times of in fleet for power services. NIO is dedicated to putting in place a power system with chargeable, swappable and upgradable experiences, making the recharging experience better than refilling. To this end, we have been making continuous investments with a vertical and horizontal network across the country and a hub and spoke layout in the metropolitan areas. We aim to bring a more convenient and joyful travel experience for our users. Our swap stations are not only efficient recharging facilities but also serve as a virtual power plants. During this summer, we responded to power grid -- we responded to power grid peak shaving in different cities while over 100 stations. In the meantime, up to 60% of the stations are regularly involved in the off-peak charging by increasing the electricity consumption in off-peak hours. To support energy saving and emission reduction, NIO power swap stations will continue to support power great demand response and optic charging in more regions. As for the global markets, with the new ET7 being shipped to Europe in August, the order placement and user delivery of our new products will take place in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway this year. On August 28, was chosen by our user community as the host city for NIO Day 2022 and the preparation for the events have been officially kicked off. We look forward to sharing with you our latest progress regarding our products and the core technologies at that time. The player in the smart electric vehicle industry, NIO has been devoted to practicing corporate social responsibility and supporting global sustainable developments. Since the very beginning of our establishment, NIO has been endorsing the formular student electric China. And starting from last year, we began to endorse the formular student autonomous China, FSAC. In August of this year, NIO officially became a partner of a formulary student Germany. We would like to contribute to the development of young talents in the global automotive industry by supporting this event. On August 15, NIO officially entered into a partnership with the United Nations development program, UNDT. As a partner of the Green Park's platforms, the UNDP will conduct in-depth collaborations with NIO in areas such as the environmental protection of protected areas and the natural reserves and supporting social and partnership to encourage young innovators to explore business solutions to advance biodiversity conservation and ecological protection. The second half of 2022 will be a critical period for the delivery and production ramp-up of multiple new products of NIO, which will present huge pressure on the supply chain, production, delivery and services. The team will work closely with our partners to improve system efficiency, accelerated the mass production and the delivery of our vehicles and ensure high-quality products and the service experience. As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the floor over to Steven to provide you the financial details for the second quarter. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the second quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details. Our total revenues in the second quarter were RMB 10.3 billion, with an increase of 21.8% year-over-year and 3.9% quarter-on-quarter. Our total revenues are made of 2 parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the second quarter was RMB 9.6 billion, representing increase of 21% year-over-year and 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher deliveries. Increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly driven by higher average selling price. Other sales in the second quarter was RMB 0.7 billion, which is an increase of 34.6% year-over-year and 8.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to increased revenue derived from auto financing services, sales of service and energy packages and sales of used cars. The increase in other sales quarter-on-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased revenue derived from sales of used cars and auto financing services. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 13.0% compared with 18.6% in the second quarter of 2021 and 14.6% in the first quarter of 20225. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was attributed to the decrease of vehicle margin and reduction of other sales margins, resulting from expanded investment in power and service network. The decreased gross margin part of the quarter has been attributed to decrease of vehicle margin. More specifically, regarding the second quarter was 16.7% compared with 2.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and 18.1% in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter was mainly attributed to increased battery cost per unit, which was partially offset by favorable changes in sales mix of ET7. R&D expenses in the second quarter were RMB 2.1 billion, which is an increase 143.2% year-over-year, 22% quarter-over-quarter. In credit year-over-year and quarter, increased patent costs and development countries as we add incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies. G&A expenses in the second quarter was RMB 2.3 billion, which is an increase of 52.4% year-over-year and 13.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily to the increase in department costs and costs related to sales and service network expansion. The increase in SG&A expenses quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed increase in personnel costs and increase in marketing and promotion services include expenses the latest launch of. Loss from operations in the second quarter was RMB 2.8 billion, which an increase of 272.8% year-over-year and 30% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss in the second quarter was RMB 2.8 billion, represent an increase of 360.6% year-over-year and 37% quarter-to-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the second quarter was RMB 2.7 billion, which is an increase 316.4% year-over-year and 50.4% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 54.4 billion as of June 30, 2022. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to pursue our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. [Foreign Language] So I've got 2 questions. The first one is about the component supply crunch. Because the supply bottleneck continuously kept the sales upside of the models like ET7. Should be concerned about any potential hiccup to the production of models like ES7 and ET5 in upcoming months? And in light of fresh round of the operating in China, what has NIO team done so far to hedge the risk of potential disruption to the company's upcoming models? And even for next year, we are going to have the NT2.0 for and EC6. So what have we done to avoid this kind of risk to our production? The second question is about the chipset. I just want to learn that, what's your take on the restriction to the export of high-end GPU from companies like Media and AMD to China? While near term, the impact to the auto industry should be pretty limited. But would that accelerate our new point of semiconductors, the localization in the upcoming models or even speed up the in-house development of our own chips for functions like autonomous driving in the future? [Foreign Language] Thanks, Tim, for your question. Regarding the first question. In the third quarter, especially in terms of July and August, we have some supply chain hiccups. And we believe COVID-19 resurgence in some regions in China in September also effects of our supply chain to some extent. But based on our experience, accumulated throughout the March and the April experience in Shanghai, we believe that the COVID-19 impact is under control compared with that of the quarter. Regarding the macro casting components, the yield rate is below our expectation, and this has affected the vehicle delivery to us, but we have already taken multiple measures to use the yield rate of the macro casting components. For example, we have already sent over dozens of engineers to our suppliers to help them to improve the yield rates that we have already witnessed some improvements. At the same time, we have also introduced some new partners for the micro testing component. We believe we have already resolved this due to some extent, the preliminary stage, we understand properly in October, we should be able to resolve this issue at once. Of course, we are about our delivery in the fourth quarter, and we are confident that our delivery targets for the whole year. Of course, there will be many challenges ahead of us, but we will drive back to achieve the target and improve delivery performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding the U.S. shipment related with the AI training chipset, we believe that this will not have an impact on our business operations. Based on offer estimations over computing power is sufficient for our autonomous driving technology in in the aspect of the AI training for now, and we have been working very closely with our partner, NVIDIA. At the same time, we have been keep monitoring the situation very closely. We understand -- there are also many AI chipsets type companies in China who are working on the mass production of their chipset, so we are evaluating a different kind of technical solutions for this AI training chipsets, and we would like to work with different companies on this respect. Basically, we believe that this is not going to affect our long-term strategy. Of course, we are building of our core technology and the capabilities, including the chipset. And we believe our target is to build the full stack in-house capabilities in all those key core technologies. We are building our capabilities, and we believe that this is going to help us to mitigate the political risks and the regulatory risks. At the same time, it can also help us to improve our technology powers and also offer gross margin as well. The next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America. [Foreign Language] What is your latest guidance in the SG&A and the R&D ratio, considering more industry competition and also overall lower sales for the industry. Do you have any new target for your point of sales? Second question your ET5 5 and ET7 have very good feedback during the Chengdu Auto Show. But currently, there is more competition and product iteration in the industry. Will you speed up the new product launch? And also, could you give some guidance regarding your 2023 new model plan? And can you also share do you have any plan for third brand? [Foreign Language] Thanks, Ming, for the question. Yes, in the industry, we have seen many companies launching good products in the market. But in terms of the investment, we would like to follow our own strategy and cadence. In terms of R&D, of course, this is our long-term strategy. We'd like to make decisive investments on R&D. This year, we have ramped up of our R&D investment to improve our long-term competitiveness. And also for the SG&A, as a percentage of the revenue, we believe the long-term trend is -- this is going down. And we don't expect to change our pace or our strategy just because of the competition in the external environment, we would like to make sure we can focus and determined on our own strategy and pace. Well, for the ET5, we have already showcased the ET5 in different aspects in the Chendu Auto Show and other exhibitions and auto so as well. We have also received a wide range of media coverage for the ET5. ET5 has attracted a lot of attention of the users, the public and the media, and we have received very good reviews and feedback from the user itself. Next year, we plan to further launch more products based on the NT2 technology platforms, and we plan to upgrade our parent ADV to the technology platform 2.0. We believe with all the product rolled over to the new technology platform 2.0, we will be very confident regarding our market performance at that time. Because if we look at the ET7, the ES7 and the ET5, we the comprehensive competitiveness of the NT2 technology platform. And we have launched many innovations that have been very much welcomed by our users. Of course, at this moment, I cannot share much details regarding the new product launch, and we would like to say that we are going to accelerate the ramp-up of our new products based on the new technology platform. Okay. Regarding the third question, of course, we would like to have more and more users to use of the products and enjoying of our technologies. At the same time, to pay attention to the users' needs and advance at different price range and users of a different brand may have a different need regarding the products and the technologies. So for us, we would like to have more smart EV users to experience our products and enjoy the benefits of those core technologies, and we will make decisive planning regarding this. The next question comes from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. [Foreign Language] My first question is the full year volume guidance. As you already previous guide that second half this year, the volume guidance will be 100,000 units. If you're considering our third quarter guidance, that means fact in the last quarter, #4 quarter, your volume will be around 68,000 units. Is that true or not say in October '23 or in November '22 and December '24 to '25 think about your volume progress? That's the other 1 question. And then 2 is about the order backlog. We actually do some data visit to a dealer. They told me tight 3 to 4 months with a new products, say, yes, 785. So can I assume both 15,000 are ordered for the 7, 15,000 for ET7 and roughly 55,000 for ET5. So together, you've got an 80,000 order backlog. That is the right way to think about the order backlog? That's the second question. And last one is about margin outlook in the number 3 quarter. Basically, the second quarter guidance, previously, that will be declined 3% to 4% Q-on-Q and right now the margin seems to be better than your guidance, right? So what's your outlook for the number 3 quarter? You actually have been with the price for 2x for the old products, should the third quarter gross margin return to a level in the first quarter and this year? [Foreign Language] Thanks, Bin, for your question. Previously, I've also mentioned that we will try our best to meet the delivery target for this year. Of course, this means that the fourth quarter is going to witness a lot of pressure and the challenges on our delivery and supply. We have already started to make the preparation for the delivery starting from the third quarter. We believe starting from the fourth quarter, we're going to have the 2 factories are running to make sure we can support the delivery demand. Actually, starting from the third quarter, have already kicked off of the tooling and the preparation for the mass production of ET5 at large scale in the factory II in the NIO part. At the beginning, we believe the production capacity of the Factory 2 is a relatively lower compared with the Factory 1 because the factory I will only need to manufacture one product that is ET5. So we believe in the fourth quarter, we are going to break record every month. And we are confident to achieve the record-breaking target for the fourth quarter, and we have been making active preparations to meet this target as well. Actually, we haven't -- yes. Regarding the specific order information, we believe we haven't disclosed this information for a long time because different companies have different definitions and understanding regarding the orders. But what I can say now is that we have a sufficient order backlog regarding the ES7 and the ET7. Actually, for the ES7, we believe the order performance at much better than our expectation. For the ET5, the waiting time is much longer. Recently, we believe that the bottleneck or the constraints and not about the demand, is mainly about the production capacity of the supply chain, of course, for our own production capacity. So we believe we have already made sufficient preparations, but the main constraint will be in the supply chain. For other questions about -- [Foreign Language] Okay. William, yes. For the third question about the gross profit margin of Q3 and second half year. Sure, the company has taken multiple measures to improve our gross margin profit. And we reached the selling prices of certain vehicle models by and ET7, and most of the positive impact will be reflected in Q3. Most of es7 starting to be delivered in Q3, our first addition with higher price and margins. So we expect a slight increase of vehicle margin in Q3. But in short term, we are still facing great uncertainty and challenges regarding the battery cost which will be -- which will have a negative impact to our gross margin. Thank you, Bin. The next question comes from Jeff Chung from Citi. [Foreign Language] So my first question is about the ET5 production capacity. How many ET5 we can produce in December? And what is the pace on ET5's ramp up from October to December? This is the first question. And the second question is about the overall production ramp-up from September to December. So our third quarter guidance implied the September run rate should be accelerated by 15% month-on-month. So in order to meet our full year's target, the October to December month-on-month revenue it has to be at least a 30% level on every month. So should we expect a straight-line ramp-up or accelerating pace? That's December, November, the portion could be more critical rather compared to October? [Foreign Language] Thank you, Jeff. Yes, actually, I think for the production capacity ramp-up, everyone understands this will make some time and there's a process, especially when it comes to new product production ramp-up. At the beginning, it will start at a relatively low volume and then it can accelerate to a stable level. We have already made sufficient appropriations for the mass production of the ET5. And we believe the ET5 will have the opportunity to surpass the 10,000 units in 1 month. If we look at December, of course, our internal target for ET5 should be higher than this. For the November and December, we believe we are going to break the delivery record month over month. Especially, we are going to see the peak at December. Previously, I have also mentioned in October, the supply chain bottleneck will be resolved for the ES7 and the ET7 and around that time, we will also ramp up the production of the ET5. So it means that we're going to see the delivery volume to gradually ramp up. But at this moment, we cannot predict with certainty because there are many factors outside of our control. But in the past few years, we have experienced many challenges and extreme situations. In the past, we have accumulated lots of experiences. So our team knows how to handle those challenges and ramp-up of production amid those challenges. We believe in the fourth quarter, of course, we're going to experience any pressure in terms of the supply chain and production, but we are confident to make sure we can meet the target that we set for. [Foreign Language] So my question is if the production capacity is 10,000 -- [Foreign Language] Of course, for the reservation orders, there are some fluctuations and uncertainties. But for the production order confirmation, this is the starting point for us to make the arrangement of the actual production of ET5. If you would like to get your ET5 earlier, then, of course, you should place your orders as soon as possible. The next question comes from Edison Yu from Deutsche Bank. First one, we noticed that William visited the U.S. last month. And I was wondering what kind of decisions or perhaps considerations were taken when he was there perhaps earlier entry into the U.S.? And then the second question is the original plan was to introduce a solid hybrid battery pack, I believe, in the fourth quarter. Is there any updates to this? Is it still on track? [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] Thank you, Edison, for your question. NIO is a global setup from day 1. Actually, we set up the San Jose R&D center back in 2015. Because of the COVID-19 situation, I haven’t been able to visit of our colleagues in the U.S. for several years. We actually have hundreds of colleagues here based in the U.S., and we also have colleagues in Europe. So at this time, I would like to visit our colleagues here in the U.S. and then I will also go to Europe to visit over colleagues over there. For the U.S. market entry, we have been making preparations for a long time. We have been thinking about the U.S. market entry strategy back in 2017, and this has been in planning for almost 5 years already. We have been thinking about what kind of products should be the best product for the U.S. market? What kind of user experience we should provide? And what should be the right business model for the U.S. market? We believe – so right now, we have a much clear plan regarding the U.S. market entry, and we have been making comprehensive preparations based on our plan and the strategy for the U.S. market. U.S. market is quite different from the China market and also the European market. The U.S. market is very competitive and regulatory environment is also quite different from China and Europe. We have been making long-term thinking and preparation about the U.S. market entry. And we believe that the right strategy for us is to make comprehensive preparations and patience. Of course, there isn’t much details we can disclose at this moment. But we believe we have a clear strategy for the U.S. market entry, and we just need to be patient for the execution. For the 150-kilowatt hour semisolids battery pack, this battery pack offers a very high power density, and we are making comprehensive evaluations of this semisolid battery pack. We are making preparations for the production of the battery pack together the with our partners. But according to our current evaluation, we believe that probably we are not going to provide this service to our users in the fourth quarter. And according to the current evaluation, this battery pack will be delayed for several months. Of course, we have been working with our partners to evaluate the progress and this is the current situation that we will try to work with our partners to improve the situation. The next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. [Foreign Language] So 2 questions from me. The first one is, have you realize that there might be some orders that have been placed by certain people who is not really intending to get the vehicle, but just to and try to sell the order to someone else for profit, which the order and give some misleading information for your production plan. And how do you prepare for that? My second question is regarding your secondary and tertiary brands preparation, Outpace and Firefly. We noticed that there are some orders has been entered with some suppliers, especially from the batteries and other components. Are there more color management can share compared to, let's say, 2 quarters ago? [Foreign Language] Thanks, Paul, for your question. Regarding the first question, of course, if we cannot meet the user demand in a timely manner then probably some users may transfer their orders to others. But we have very strict policies regarding the order transfer. So we believe there will be very few cases for the order transfer. And the percentage of order transfer will be quite low. This is probably also because of our follow-up mechanism. If you place a reservation order for now, then will follow up with you regarding the specific orders and then be converted to the actual production orders. In our current order backlog, we lead the percentage of users who are only placing the orders to make sure they can transfer the orders to others in the future to make a profit. This percentage should be quite low because of all the different mechanisms we have in place. For the mass market brand, previously, we have already discussed about our plans for the mass market brand. Currently, the R&D progress is on track. Our plan for the mass market, the product is to follow the schedule and the cadence of offer latest technology platform that is the new technology platform 3.0. We're going to launch the mass market products based on the new technology platform 3.0. Yes, probably from the media and the supply chain, there have been some discussions about the third brand of NIO. Actually, in the past, we have recognized that if we want to accelerate the conversion from the ICE to EV, we will link to provide more products to cater to different user in different segments. And we believe in the past year, we have witnessed tremendous growth in terms of the EV demand at the entry-level market segment, which has also been driving the EV penetration here in the China market. We have realized some interesting opportunities for the business model innovation. And I believe NIO is very good at combining the innovative technologies with the user experience and provide very innovative experience to our users. We have identified some opportunities for us to make innovative technologies and blended together with the business models to provide services to the users and provide a different kind of products to a wider range of user groups and communities. So at this moment, we cannot disclose much information about it. But what I can say is that we do believe that there are some opportunities about. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back to Ms. Eve Tang for closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. [Foreign Language] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's third quarter 2022 earnings call. In the third quarter 2022 NIO delivered a total of 31,607 smart electrical vehicles, up 29.3% year-over-year setting a new quarterly high. Based on our latest technology platform, NT2.0, we have launched and delivered three new products, which has improved the competitiveness of our product line-up in all aspects and enabled NIO to enter more premium segments, catalyzing continuous demand growth.
In October, overcoming the production and supply chain volatility, we delivered 10,059 vehicles, representing a 174.3% increase year-over-year. We will continue to collaborate closely with our supply chain partners to stabilize components supply and further accelerate the vehicle production and the delivery. We expect the total number of deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be between 43,000 to 48,000.
Next, I would like to share some recent highlights of our R&D and operations. In September as the show cars of ET5, a smart electric midsize sedan began to be on display in our stores. Store traffic reached a record high and order intake witnessed its strong growth momentum. On September 30, we officially kicked off the delivery of ET5 and the preliminary user satisfaction rate exceeded our expectations.
Over the past couple of months, Banyan, the digital system of NT2 has iterated and upgraded multiple times with continuous user experience improvement. We have strong confidence in the market competitiveness of the new models based on the NT2 platform.
With respect to the sales and service network, we now have 399 new houses and the new spaces in 149 cities and 280 service centers and delivery centers in 163 cities. In terms of the charging and swapping network, NIO has installed a total of 1,210 power swap stations and provided 14 million battery swaps for users. NIO has installed 2,055 charging stations with 5,765 for power chargers and 6,077 destination chargers in place. In the meantime, our power map [ph] has connected to over 590,000 third party chargers in China and more than 380,000 chargers in Europe.
Since we entered the Norwegian market last September, our products and services have been well received by local users and the user community has been growing rapidly, which has laid a solid foundation for and boosted our competency in entering more markets in Europe.
On October 7 this year, we held NIO Berlin 2022 while we comprehensively introduced our products and services to users in Europe, marking of our official market entry in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden.
NIO Berlin drew a lot of attention and recommendation from users and the auto industry in Europe. We are now organizing larger scale test drives and kicked off user delivery in Europe.
Yesterday, NIO ET7 won the 2022 Golden Steering Wheel award granted by the prestigious German Magazine Auto Bild, as ET7 was voted the best car in the median and upper class category. Both of our products and innovative technology have been highly recognized by the users, industry experts and professional media in Europe.
To better serve user communities in Europe, we plan to open new houses and new spaces in 10 major European cities such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Rotterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm. We also plan to install 20 power swap stations in Europe by the end - by the year end and another 100 by the end of 2023. So that more users can experience new chargeable, swappable and upgradable power system in Europe.
In addition, we have established an R&D center in Berlin for localized development and deployment of digital cockpit and ADAS to continuously improve for the intelligent digital experience of local users.
On September 27, NIO announced the cooperation with the Danish Society for Natural Conservation and Danish Nature Foundation under Clean Parks initiative. NIO hopes to actively engage with the local communities, share their responsibilities and jointly make contributions to a more sustainable future.
On September 30, upholding news [indiscernible] aspiration of Blue Sky Coming, NIO released the first NIO Environment, Social and Governance report 2021, where NIO shared its ESG management practices and performance in 2021.
In 2022, NIO has further advanced in product core technologies, charging and swapping network, as well as sales and service network which have laid a solid foundation for us to compete in the global market for the long run. In spite of the operation challenges brought forward by the changing micro environment, we believe that NIO is fully capable of staying focused on product and technology innovations, as well as its service capability improvement, while further optimizing the cost structure and improving operational efficiency to do more beyond the experience products and services to users worldwide.
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide you the financial details for the third quarter 2022. Over to you Steven. Thank you. I will now go over our key [Technical Difficulty] for the third quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB 13.0 billion, representing an increase of 32.6% year-over-year, and 26.3% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the third quarter were RMB 11.9 billion, representing increase of 38.2% year-over-year and 24.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to higher deliveries, as a result of more diversified product mix offered to our users.
Other sales in the third quarter were RMB1.1 billion, representing a decrease of 8.5% year-over-year and an increase of 48.2% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the decreased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits, offset by the increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales.
The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits and increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales.
Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 13.3%, compared with 20.3% in the third quarter of 2021 and 13.0% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to first, the decreased revenue derived from sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin, second, the decrease of vehicle margin, and third the reduction in other sales margin resulting from expanding investment in power and service network. The increase of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the sales of automotive regulatory credits with high sales margin.
More specifically, vehicle margin in the third quarter was 16.4%, compared with 18.0% in the third quarter of 2021 and 16.7% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased battery cost per unit, which was partially offset by the decrease in subsidization in user vehicle financing arrangements. Vehicle margin remained stable quarter-over-quarter.
R&D expenses in the third quarter were RMB2.9 billion, representing an increase of 146.8% year-over-year and 37% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increased personnel costs in research and development functions as well as the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.
SG&A expenses in the third quarter were RMB2.7 billion, representing an increase of 48.6% year-over-year and 18.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to, first, the increase in personnel costs related to sales and general corporate functions, second, increased expenses related to the Company’s sales and service network expansion, third, increase in marketing and promotional activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe.
Loss from operations in the third quarter was RMB3.9 billion, representing an increase of 290.2% year-over-year and 36.0% quarter-over-quarter. Other losses, net in the third quarter of 2022 was RMB495.6 million, representing an increase of RMB528.2 million from other income of RMB32.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of RMB305.6 million from the second quarter of 2022. The increase of other losses over the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the loss from the revaluation of our overseas RMB-related assets as a result of the depreciation of RMB against U.S. dollars in the third quarter of 2022.
Net loss in the third quarter was RMB4.1 billion, representing an increase of 392.1% year-over-year and 49.1% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO’s ordinary shareholders in the third quarter was RMB 4.1 billion, representing an increase of 44.9% year-over-year 50.9% quarter-over-quarter.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investment and long-term time deposits were RMB51.4 billion as of September 30, 2022.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session.
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ming Lee with Bank of America. Please go ahead. William, Steven, hi. [Foreign Language] Previously your capped by component supply, especially the welding part, as well as the chips. So could you also update your latest capacity component capacity? If there is no COVID control, impact. Thank you. [Foreign Language
Thank you, Ming for the question. Yes, regarding the production in October, there has been some impact due to several reasons and the impact is around several thousand. One the factor is because of the subframe just like you mentioned, but we expect that this will be resolved in November.
And then the second reason is the new EDS for ET5, we actually have a new EDS pump next to our factor II [ph] and the automation level of the new EDS pumps is very high. We only need to have around 30,000 people to support the overall operation of these new EDS pump.
Due to the ramp-up volatilities of the EDS over production is affected by around 2 to 3000. And the third reason is the COVID-19 situation. I believe this has impacted the production for around one week. So overall speaking, all those factors have affected the production in October, but we have resumed normal production now, and we expect to have a new production line for the new EDS next week and probably by the end of this month this new EDS line will be ready and we can ramp up the production. We will - we have already solved the subframe issue. And I believe probably in December, 85 production will not be a issue. And as of now, I don't believe there is any production issue for the ET7 and the ES7. [Foreign Language] The U.S. semi band [ph] how will this impact the development for the industry and also NIO. Besides Nvidia currently can sell 800 chips to China if compared to 100, how do you see the impact to the progress of our autonomous driving training? [Foreign Language] Thank you for your question. Regarding the Chip Act. I believe this many affected the chip used for cloud training. Right now, I believe that we have a sufficient chips like the A100 to satisfy the need for the AD training in the long run.
But at the same time, we are also exploring different opportunities. For example, we're considering working together with some cloud service providers, and we are also evaluating some long-term solutions to support the integration of our AD solutions. As of now, I don't actually see any impact on overall operations. Thank you, Ming. Our next question comes from Paul Gong with UBS. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is regarding the ET5 order. Just now you mentioned that the satisfaction level has some - beat your expectations. But you did mention how the orders intake has been. How do you see the orders intake in the months and especially after the late October after Tesla launched another way of price cut, do you see any impact from there? This is my first question. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Paul, for your question. Of course, I understand regarding the ET5 orders. The more important thing for us is right now to find ways to deliver ET5 users and shorten the waiting time for the users. So generally speaking, order is not an issue for us regarding ET5.
Regarding the ramp-up of ET5 because this is still at a relatively early stages, so we would like to pay more attention to the quality improvement and make sure we can stabilize the quality of the ET5. The demand for ETF is very strong as we expected. Of course, it's a strong - if the order can be even stronger, the stronger the better. But if - but at the same time, we don't want the user to wait for a really long time.
If we come back to Tesla, Tesla often cut its prices. So we don't actually think this affected the user demand regarding new product. If we look at the specific products, like the Model 3, there is a big press gap compared with other products. And if we compare the Model Y with over ES6, we don't actually believe that we are competing in the same segment. So if we look at the pricing of our products and the positioning of our product, that's strictly speaking, we're not competing with Tesla in the same segment. [Foreign Language] So my second question is regarding the expenses, including both R&D and SG&A. It seems to be climbing up a lot Q-on-Q this quarter. Is that just temporary because you have new products and trying to explore the market in Europe? Or is it more like structural? And if so, what is your expectation for its trends going forward? Hi, Paul, this is Stanny. The increase of SG&A in Q3 compared with Q2 is because our sales and service network in China and also in Europe since we entered more country market in Europe this third quarter and also some marketing and promotion activities - more marketing and promotion activities in Q3 compared with Q2.
From the long term, I think also you can check with - you can check this result from Q3, SG&A as a percentage of sales revenue will continue to be optimized along with the improvement of our operation efficiency. I think in 2023 and also the coming years, you will see a stable trend to - for further improvement of this ratio. [Foreign Language] Regarding the R&D expenses, yes, we do see some increase in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. This is mainly because of our new product development cadence, as well as other initiatives like the battery chipsets and the test and the validations when we enter new markets, as well as the employee cost and the ETP cost. This is actually part of our over plan, and we don't think that there is any other additional R&D expenses that is out of the planning of the company. [Foreign Language] Regarding the R&D operations, I believe right now, we have entered a relative stable phase regarding the R&D development work, as well as the operations. So for us, we believe when it comes to the R&D expenses, including the human resources cost, it will stay at a relatively stable level. For example, probably every quarter, it should be around RMB 3 billion.
Of course, at the same time, we will continue to improve the system efficiency of our R&D efforts and - but for some time from now, I believe it will stay at this level to make sure we can have more product and technology innovations to provide better experience for the users. [Foreign Language] So what is roughly the ratio of Europe accounts for this quarter session? Yes. Hi, Paul. You know, Europe is now at quite initial stage. So currently, the overall expense is not a big percentage of the overall SG&A. Now the mark - the sales and marketing team for our Europe business is about 500 headcount. So yes, that's basically the information for our Europe business. Okay. Thank you very much. [Foreign Language] Our next question comes from Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is about the production and delivery. So I think based on the fourth quarter guidance, basically, the average delivery in November, December could be around 17,000 to 19,000. So what would be the peak monthly output NIO can reach by end of this year? And how is the trajectory looks like into first half next year?
With the supply chain bottleneck kind of a structure issue, given the unchanged COVID policy, and more new model, new players and likely longer time for suppliers to expand their capacity they improve their production yield? [Foreign Language] About speaking, it's quite difficult for us to make estimation regarding the impact of the corporate control and prevention measures on the operation of the company. But if we talk about the supply chain and the vehicle production, I believe the vehicle production capabilities should be able to meet the delivery target we set for next year.
And if we speak of the supply chain, we do see some challenges, for example, in December, we will face some constraints regarding the supply of the silicon top line. But if we look at 2023, I believe the supply chain and the production capacity has the capability to meet the demand and the target that we set up for ourselves. [Foreign Language] For 2023, I believe for the vehicle production, we will be - have - we will have a relatively sufficient production capacity to meet the demand. And if we can achieve a 150,000 production capacity on one shift, I believe the production of the vehicle will be carried out in a very smooth manner. [Foreign Language] So my second question is about the profitability because based on our own observation, we noticed the life cycle with smart EV in China is actually getting shorter, rather than longer in traditional cars.
So considering the very sizable R&D and manufacturing investment, what would be the more reasonable terminal growth in your operating margins? And you know, should we – we should look for, especially I think the competition is getting more intense? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you for your question. Regarding the smart electric vehicles, I believe we have a much faster iteration cycle compared with the traditional vehicles. And we believe that the iteration cycle should be around 3 years, and this is how we iterating our smart technologies in NIO.
Of course, different companies have different strategies and different iteration cycles. But in NIO, if we look at our technology platforms, and we believe with one technology platform, so we actually have the same kind of hardware and software for all the vehicles based on data technology platforms.
For example, previously, we have explained, we have the NIO Technology 1.0 and the NIO Technology 2.0. So all the products are based on NIO Technology 1.0. They have the same kind of software and hardware when it comes to the smart technologies, and that's the same for NIO Technology 2.0.
At the same time, we also have the unified battery pack and we also share a lot of commonalities when it comes to the vehicle problems. Of course, previously, we mentioned we would like to offer different kind of top head to meet the diversified demands and take for different users.
So if we think about the technology platforms and of vehicle platform strategy, I think 20% to 25% vehicle gross margin is not a very big challenge for us. But if we look at 2022, specifically, the cost of the battery sky rocketed. So of course, at the same time, we have increased the price of our products. And even against this backdrop, we have, I believe, achieved a relatively reasonable vehicle gross margin.
Previously, we have also achieved a 20% vehicle gross margin in the past. Like in the past, we didn't have the battery cost increases. So this is a relatively reasonable vehicle gross margin for – our products. In the future, if the battery cost can come down to a reasonable level, I think it's possible for us to regain the 20% to 25% vehicle gross margin with our products.
In addition to that, with our vehicle technology, vertical integration, including the battery, the chipset, I believe we will have more room to improve for the vehicle gross margin, and it's possible for us to achieve 25% to 30% vehicle gross margin.
If we look at the mass market, I believe the challenge is much bigger because if we combine all the companies in the mass market right now, I think the overall gross margin is actually negative. Of course, BYD is an exception because they have the vertical integration of the batteries and other technologies.
So if we do not have the vertical integration capabilities in the mass market, it will be quite challenging to provide in the mass market. But if we have this capabilities in place, I think it's possible for us to also achieve 20% to 25% with other mass market products. Thank you, team. Our next question comes from Bin Wang with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] My question, first one is about your guidance. You know, actually asking three things. Number one, ET5 will be higher volume than BMW 3 series. And then two guidance to start, you were breakeven in the number four quarters next year. And number three, guidance, at start this year you have an 18% to 20% gross margin for the vehicle. Did you maintain this guidance for these orders? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Bin, for your question. About speaking, that's still the direction we're aiming for – for the core business of NIO, we are still aiming to achieve breakeven in the third quarter of 2023, and this is still our plan. At the same time, we're also working on different strategic new business.
For example, we have two new brands and the battery chipset and the smartphone business at the same time. So if we look at 2023, the investment for those strategic new business is going to be around RMB 3 billion to RMB 4 billion. It means that probably around RMB 1 billion every quarter. If we take all those strategic new business aside, we are still very confident to achieve breakeven for new core business in the fourth quarter of 2023. [Foreign Language] So for the second question regarding ET5, you mentioned previously the - one of cofounder mentioned that the ET5 volume is going to exceed the volume of the BMW 3 Series in AE Bank [ph] And of course, this is not a guidance, but because I believe ET5 is much, much better than BMW 3-Series. So we are very confident to achieve this target. [Foreign Language] For the vehicle gross margin, in 2022, I believe there's still many challenges for us, especially when it comes to the lithium carbonate [ph] cost. Right now, the lithium carbonate cost still stays at a very high level. Previously, it has dropped to around RMB400,000 and now is going back or actually reached a new high that is around RMB600,000. This has significantly affected the battery cost and for us, this is actually out of our control, and it's very difficult for us to predict .
But I believe we can still remain a relatively stable vehicle gross margin in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. For the lithium carbonate cost, I would like to probably share some impacts. So I don't think that the price or the cost of the lithium carbonate is due to the supply situation. Because right now, if you look at the car companies in China, I don't think that there is any car companies that cannot deliver their products because of the battery shortage.
So of course, in the future, we believe lithium carbonate cost will go down, but we cannot predict when. This has a relatively big impact on us because for all of the products we have a relatively high battery capacity. Averagely speaking, for each of our vehicles, the batteries around 80 to 90 kilowatt hours. So if the lithium carbonate cost stays at a very high level, this is going to have a big impact on the vehicle gross margin.
For us, maybe I can give you some numbers, which will probably help you to understand the situation. If we think about RMB100,000 cost for the lithium carbonate, this is actually affecting our vehicle gross margin by around 2.02%. And if we can see the lithium carbonate cost drops from 600,000 to 400,000, then this is going to improve our vehicle gross margin by around 4%. So if the lithium carbonate cost can drop to even lower, probably around RMB100,000, which is a reasonable price for the lithium carbonate then it means that our vehicle gross margin can improve by probably around 8%. So this is the reality we are facing. [Foreign Language] So my question is about what’s the Model Y [indiscernible] ET5, Tesla. And we see this going to be showcased in the upcoming year date in December this year? Thank you. [Foreign Language] So for the product line up in the first quarter of next year - in the first half of next year, we're going to have the five new products. And I believe probably one of them is going to be like the Model Y to Tesla like you mentioned. But for us, we focus more on the overall volumes of all the product line up.
We are in the premium market segment. So our philosophy is to satisfy the diversified user demand with high efficiency. In the price range from 300,000 to 500,000, we will provide a different product to satisfy the diversified user demand and the taste. So I believe with our product line up, we should be able to achieve a good of all delivery volume that can meet our expectations.
I don't actually expect that one product can fill around over or probably around – what can sell over 100,000 units in China. For example, for ET5, it can sell probably over 30,000 units per month. This is going to be a very common straight car, and I don't think this is good for the ET5 or for NIO. [Foreign Language] For the massive -- for the mass market, this is a different story. We just had a meeting today with the mass market team. And for us, we believe the mass market product can sell probably over 50,000 units per month, for one model because this is different in the market segment and different target user groups. Thank you, Bin. Our next question comes from Jeff Chung with Citi. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my question is about the sales volume growth into November and December. So in order to meet our medium quarterly target, 43,000 units. And if the month-on-month improvement to be linear at around 37%, we should be reaching around 19,000 units monthly run rate by December. So from which could you break down the volume of ET5?
And the second question is if this ramp-up pace is going to be nonlinear with most of the weight happening concentrated in December. So could you tell us what kind of elements will be determined our run rate overshot in December, but not in November? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Thank you, Jeff, for your question. In November, we will still need some time to ramp up the production, including ET5, considering the factors I just mentioned like the EDS.
In December, except the silicon carbine I just mentioned, I believe we will have more production compared with the production of November. Of course, in December, we hope that we can still achieve over 20,000 production run rate. [Foreign Language] No more questions. Thank you. The next question comes from Nick Lai with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] Let me take my two simple questions. Really, the first question is about the cash burn and the CapEx expectation as we move into '23 and '24 and also take into account of incremental investment [indiscernible]?
The second question, again, is on the AI shift to price strategy and if you can just talk about the potential opportunity dilution. We have stock of [indiscernible] 1000 chip and that was looking for car solution, that's related to algorithm, but what about the chip they use in the car? Thank you. Hi, Nick, this is Stanny. As introduced by William and myself, we will further improve our SG&A operating efficiency. And furthermore, our R&D expense will keep stable compared with - relatively stable compared with 2022. So operating cash flow wise, I think we are quite optimistic to achieve positive working - like operating cash flow in future years. So our cash burn mainly depends on the capital investment.
Now we are planning our next year's budget. And from the - generally, I think the total segue of CapEx in next year will not increase so significantly compared with this year. But we are planning more like sales and service network. And also, we are planning more production and also supply chain capacity. So at this moment, I won't give you the clear guidance. And we are also confident that our cash on hand can supply our ongoing operation until breakeven is finally achieved. Yeah. Thank you. [Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] About speaking, we understand there are still many uncertainties in the market. But I believe with our current cash reserves and also the bank facilities, we should be able to support the company's operation until we breakeven. So we don't think this is going to be a huge challenge for the company. [Foreign Language] Regarding the chipset, previously, we have already addressed the AI training chipset that is the NVIDIA A100. And now I would like to probably elaborate more on the onboard chipset.
We are the first company in the world to launch of a products that is equipped with NVIDIA already, which is actually 6 months earlier than other companies. We also have a very close collaboration with NVIDIA. But at the same time, last year, we have already kicked off the R&D of our AD chipsets. Right now, we have around 500 people working on the AD chipset.
I believe it is commonly acknowledged that AD chipset is closely coupled with the AD algorithm. If we can use the AD algorithm to define the design of the AD chipset, the overall efficiency can be significantly improved, which can also contribute to our vehicle gross margin. The overall progress of the AD chipset R&D is on track and we have seen some positive achievement from the team. [Foreign Language] Thank you. The next question comes from Jane Chang with CICC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is about in the current external environment, everyone encountered a lot of difficulties in production. So in the longer term, will we consider switching from OEM mode to self-build production? Are there any difficulties in obtaining qualification and will it optimize our new product, the ramp-up speed or manufacturing cost?
And my second question is regarding to R&D investment and CapEx about the boundary of our in-house R&D. As we can see that in the third quarter R&D extent - further expense to RMB 2.8 billion. So consider the current capital market environment and the much more intense competition in Chinese EV market in a few years. But will we adopt a more conservative strategy of R&D and CapEX? So under what circumstances, we will address our current strategy? And whether our organization is flexible enough to adjust?
And the last question is about just mentioned and PV models. So what do we think of the MTD market? Will we launch the new product pipeline in this segment in the future? That's all my three questions. [Foreign Language] For the Factory II, we are still working together with JSE. I believe our joint manufacturing corporation has been quite positive. Regarding the vehicle production, I believe the vehicle production capacity can support the company's delivery target in the short term. Previously, I've already mentioned that for one plat we should be able to achieve 150,000 units under one shift and if we combine the two plants together, the Factory I and Factor II, then you need that under one shift, so we should be able to achieve a production capacity of 300,000 units. If we double this to two shifts, then the production capacity can also be doubled.\
When it comes to the supply chain, of course, there are some volatilities for the whole industry, not just for NIO. But as we ramp up our production capacity and delivery, I believe we have the capability to mitigate the risk of the supply chain.
For the second question regarding the boundaries of our investment, previously have already mentioned, we do have a sufficient catch reserve to support the company's operations. And when it comes to the overall investment for R&D, every quarter, we expect to have - to invest around RMB 300,000 for - 300,000 actually for 3 years. Sorry, billion - sorry, every quarter, we expected to invest around RMB 3 billion R&D efforts. So this includes all the R&D initiatives we have explained previously. For the CapEx we will improve the efficiency on the CapEx investment, and we do have a very strict management regarding the finance and the investment of the company. Okay. And with regard to the MPV market, our strategy is very simple. In the short term, we have no plan to launch MPV model. Of course, long term, we'll keep monitoring the big market, also look at staff, we believe this market is very hot.
For the supply side, several Chinese brands have launched their high-end PV model, but from the demand side, at least right now, the MPV segment still remains a rich market, but that's why we would like to get more clean and then set what to do in the next several years. Our next question comes from Yuqian Ding with HSBC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] I've got two questions. First is to follow up on the margin side. So next year's gross profit margin improvement, will that be mainly coming from the increasing economic scale? Could we have some quantification over there? Because we see from the mix side, it was more 85 [ph] in the mix could be coming down a little bit.
And also, we talked about our Q4 breakeven, does that based on the current lithium price assumption or in our Q4 breakeven assumption they're basically baking normalizing of the lithium price?
And the second part is to ask, what's the City Pilot [ph] on the autonomous driving side with our time line to push for City Pilot. And when do we expect the - our autonomous driving capability to improve from selling vehicle items to support materially on the margin side? [Foreign Language] Thank you, Yuqian, for your question. As of now, of course, the lithium carbonate cost is not going down as we expected in the fourth quarter. But like I - this point previously, I don't believe this is a supply issue because if we look at the market right now, all the car companies can actually get sufficient supply of the batteries.
For us regarding the lithium resources, so we have seen some lithium resources enter the market in the past year - in the past and we expect probably next year, the cost of the lithium carbonate is going to be around RMB 300,000 to RMB 400,000.
When it comes to the budget planning of the company, of course, we would like it to be more conservative. So our assumption is around RMB 400,000. This is basically over judgment regarding the lithium carbonate cost probably for the next year. [Foreign Language] For the autonomous driving, I believe we will need some time to see the contributions of autonomous to the vehicle gross margin and the overall gross margin. There are several factors. The part is because of the feature and function development and the parties because of their legislations.
Recently, we do see some positive progress on the legislation front. For example, MIT has launched some pilot programs for the autonomous driving. And for us, we believe it will still need probably 1 to 2 years to get mature when it comes to autonomous driving technologies and also the legislations. So in the short term, we expect probably they will not see any significant contribution from the autonomous driving to the vehicle gross margin and the overall gross margin. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] CITIC Securities. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is about inventory. So the inventory is around RMB 6.7 billion on quarter 3. It is nearly doubled compared with quarter 2. So does this number imply around 10,000 more inventory cars on your balance sheet?
My second question is about ET5. It was really hot on September. But recently, we see some negative comments and news on the social media because of its poor performance on energy efficiency. So I was wondering what your next move to deal with the consumers' concerns. Thank you for taking my questions. This is Stanny. For the inventory increase in Q3, I think mainly two reasons. One is about our increase of inventory cars in Q3. Our production was negatively impacted by our [indiscernible] in Q3. So we increased the production of EC8, and EC6 in Q3.
Secondly, it's because of the increase of the component inventory to secure the production in the coming months, we stored more key materials like chips and also other raw materials in Q3. So all those factors lead to the increase of our inventory stock. [Foreign Language] Yes, for the EC5, different tires may have a different impact and the different performance when it comes to the power consumption. If the users choose a performance tire than the power consumption will be higher. But if the user choose the long range tire or the low resistance tire than the power consumption performance is going to be much better.
So we would also like to remind all the users, if you really enjoy driving and handling and you would like to experience the acceleration of EC5 within 4 seconds, then of course, you can go with the performance tire. But if you care more about the drive range, then it's better for you to go with the long-range tire, which will have a much better performance when it comes to the rent. [Foreign Language] As there are no further questions, now I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact the new Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. [Foreign Language] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2022 Q4 earnings conference. In Q4, 2022, NIO delivered a total of 4,052 smart electric vehicles, up 60% year-over-year, achieving a new quarterly record. According to the retail data released by CATRC, China Automotive Technology and Research Center, NIO was the best-selling brand in China's premium EV market, priced over RMB 300,000 with a market share of 54.8%, while over market share in the premium EV market priced over RMB 400,000 reached 75.8%.
In 2022, despite the impact posed by COVID and supply chain disruptions, NIO delivered a total of 122,486 smart electric vehicles, up 34% year-over-year. In January and February of 2023, we delivered 20,663 vehicles, representing a 30.89% increase year-over-year. We expect the total deliveries in the first quarter of this year to be between 31,000 and 33,000 units. As the penetration rate of the premium EV growth and more NIO products is expected to be delivered in the second quarter, we have a strong confidence in the market demand in 2023.
Next, I would like to share some recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations. Since we started to deliver ET5 in September 2022, it's the production and delivery has been ramping up steadily. According to CATARC's retail data, this January, among all the mid-size sedans priced over RMB 300,000, NIO ET5 outperformed popular internal combustion vehicles from well-established brands and became the top-selling model in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other 15 cities in China and the second best-selling model nationwide in China.
On December 24, 2022, we held NIO Day 2022 in Hefei, where we launched the smart electric flagship coupe SUV EC7 and all-round flagship SUV, the All-New ES8. EC7 is a large-sized coupe SUV that encourage NIO's high-performance DNA and delivers ultimate handling and the riding experience. The delivery of EC7 is expected to start in May. As NIO's flagship SUV based on the technology platform 2.0, the six seater All-new ES8 offers two seat layouts, catering to all scenarios including work, family, social, and exploration. The delivery of the All-new ES8 is expected to start in June, both new products have attracted wide attention and received great feedback.
In the first half of this year, NIO will gradually launch more new products and shortened the waiting time for our launch to user delivery. Other supply chain and manufacturing teams have been preparing for new product launches and production ramp-up, making sure that supply and production go hand-in-hand with the growing demand for the new product.
For intelligent driving, NIO has gradually rolled out NOP+ Beta to all NT2.0 vehicles. Based on our full stack in-house developed intelligent driving technologies and the closed-loop data management. NOP+ Beta has realized significant improvements in areas of a sense of reassurance, comfort, and efficiency.
The utilization rate has doubled with a total engaged mileage of over 1.75 million kilometers in the recent week. We plan to roll out more features and functions to our users and will gradually release power swap pallet for highway in the first half of this year.
With respect to the sales and service network, we now have 375 NIO houses and NIO spaces in 141 cities and 305 NIO service centers and NIO delivery centers in 148 cities.
In terms of the charging and swapping network, NIO has installed a total of 1,331 power swap stations and provided over 18 million battery swap for our users. In the meantime, NIO has accumulatively deployed 60,385 power chargers and 7,558 destination chargers sent over power map has been connected to over 1.04 million third-party charges. In 2022, 50% of the power charged by our users is from battery swapping stations, which has become the most convenient and favorite solution among new users.
[Foreign Language] In 2023, NIO will speed up the development of the battery swapping network and plan to install additional 1,000 power swap stations. By the end of 2023, there will be more than 3,000 -- 2,000 to 3,000 power swap stations in total. So far, the mass production of power swap station 3.0 is going forward smoothly with large-scale production expected to start in April, the accelerated deployment of power swap stations can not only provide existing users with experiences beyond expectations, but also significantly boost user demand.
[Foreign Language] In Q4 2022, NIO started to offer NT2.0 products and comprehensive services in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. NIO products have been highly recognized by professional media in Europe, and the user satisfaction rate has also reached off expectations.
After obtaining the prestigious Golden Steering Wheel award, ET7 was honored with multiple awards in Europe, such as the Technological Front-Runner of the Year at the Danish Auto Awards, Car of the Year and The Best in the Luxury segment by Auto Motor Sport, Sweden and the Promise of 2023 by the Association of Business Drivers in Netherlands.
On January 31, 2023, we started to deliver EL7 of mid-large smart electric SUV to the first batch of users in Europe. As we continue to introduce a more diversified product portfolio, expand our sales to service and power network, improve over brand awareness, we are confident in our long-term development in Europe.
[Foreign Language] On the efforts of our strategic NIO business, including batteries, AD chips and mass market brand, are also well on track.
The development of NIO wouldn't have been possible without our users and customers. In 2022, 4,447 users volunteered at auto shows, NIO Day and other events. NIO users have also been actively making contributions to society with the participation of public wealth activities reaching 60,204 people times in 2022.
On January 18, 2023. NIO was recognized in Corporate Knights 2023 Global 100, the world's most sustainable companies to list, among 333 companies in the car and trucks manufacturing, including parts category, NIO ranked in first. In the meantime, on January 31, 2023, NIO the second advanced manufacturing base with certified 3-star growing building and lead coat marking the first of its kind in China.
We attach particular importance to low carbon development, environmental production and ecosystem co-construction and actively practice sustainable philosophy to continuously improve over years to performance.
In 2022, to build our long-term competitiveness we made decisive investments and achieved a positive strides in the research and development of core technologies and products, the deployment of charging and swapping infrastructure as well as sales and service network and the global market expansion, laying a solid foundation for the company's long-term growth.
As of the product portfolio Transition to NT2.0 with more NIO products to be launched and delivered in 2023. We will do our level best to provide users with experiences beyond expectations. At the same time, we aim for all-around execution efficiency improvements so as to compete in the global EV market in the long run in an agile and efficient manner.
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the fourth quarter. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the fourth quarter were RMB 16.1 billion, representing an increase of 62.2% year-over-year, and 23.5% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 14.8 billion, representing an increase of 16.2% year-over-year and 23.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher deliveries, as a result of a more diversified product mix offered to our users.
The increase in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to volume ramp up of the ET5 and ES7. Other sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 1.3 billion, representing an increase of 90.3% year-over-year, an increase of 22% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the increase of revenue from rendering of research and development services and increase in other revenues in line with the incremental vehicle sales.
The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to increase of revenue from rendering of research and development services and increasing sales for accessories charging piles and used cars in line with the incremental vehicle sales, partially offset by the sales of automotive regulatory credits in the third quarter of 2022.
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.9%, compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 13.3% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease of gross margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to decreased vehicle margin. The decrease of gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to decreased vehicle margin and the decrease in other sales margin, mainly resulted from the sales of automotive regulatory credits with high gross margin in the third quarter of 2022.
More specifically, vehicle margin in the fourth quarter was 6.8% compared with 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 16.4% in the third quarter of 2022. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to: first, increased inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the existing generation of ES8, ES6, NC6 but are expected to have lower production levels and deliveries due to the transition to new models on the NIO technology platform 2.0, which in totality elected impacted vehicle margin by 6.7%; and second, increased battery cost per unit.
The decrease of vehicle margin from the third quarter of 2022 was mainly due to the increased inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the existing generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6.
R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 4.0 billion, representing an increase of 117.7% year-over-year and 35.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was attributed to the increase personnel costs in research and development functions as well the incremental design and dividend cost of new products and technologies.
SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were RMB 3.5 billion, representing an increase of 49.6% year-over-year and 30% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to: first, the increase in percent costs related to sales and general corporate functions; second, the increase in marketing and promotion activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe. Third, in credit expenses related to the company's sales and service network expansion.
Last, operations in the fourth quarter was RMB 6.7 billion, representing increase of 175.5% year-over-year and 74% quarter-over-quarter. Operating costs net in the fourth quarter of 2022 was RMB 315.7 million, representing an increase of RMB 262.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of RMB 811.3 million for other losses of RMB 495.6 million in the third quarter of 2022.
The increase of adding comps year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but mainly due to the gains from the revaluation of our overseas RMB-related assets as the result of appreciation of RMB against US dollars in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Net loss in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.8 billion, representing an increase of 169.9% year-over-year and 40.8% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.8 billion, representing an increase of 168.3% year-over-year and 41.2% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investment in long-term time deposits was RMB 45.5 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to proceed with our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is about the supply chain and also the automotive, because NIO shipment last year were seriously dragged by the supply bottleneck of aluminum parts, CDS and chips. So, according to the announcement of NIO's first quarter volume guidance of 31,000 to 33,000 or does it suggest more moderated vehicle sales in March. Is that because component that still suffered from supply constrained? What current vehicle production run rate and how fast you could ramp up on weekly and while we pace into second quarter? [Foreign Language] Thank you, Tim, for your question. In the fourth quarter of last year, the supply of the parts have affected over vehicle deliveries to some extent. But starting from the first quarter of this year, we have seen that the control and prevention measures regarding the COVID have been lifted. So currently, we believe the supply of the parts is not the bottleneck for us.
Starting from the second quarter, we believe with over new vehicle deliveries, we will need to have some time to ramp up the production, but we don't believe that the part supply will be a constraint for us. [Foreign Language] So my second question is about the battery cost and those of the gross margin, because the fourth quarter vehicle gross margin dropped more significantly. So we think the 6.7 percentage point margin dropped mentioned in the announcement, how much of that would be one-off? And how much of that would be lasting into first quarter? In the meantime, on the bright side, I think battery prices caught below to the vehicle margin, NIO's vehicle margin this year. So how should we think about the contribution from the new battery country prices? Because I recall that we mentioned we RMB 100,000 decrease in E. cognate well to about 2 percentage point vehicle gross margin expansion. So could you please share some updates regarding how much more contribution from the lower base cost, should we expect this year or in first half? Thank you. Thank you, Tim. This is Stanley. First, I want to further clarify the Q4's 2022 gross profit margin. Since our brand new ES8, ES6, EC6 will start user delivery in Q2 23. So we lowered our order forecast for current generation ES8, ES6 and EC6 in Q4 2022. So inventory provision and losses on purchase commitment relate to those products was booked in Q4 with total amount of RMB 985 million, excluding this impact, the vehicle margin in Q4 was 13.5%. So compared with the last quarter, the decrease results from the change of product mix especially more ET5 sold in Q4 with lower gross profit margin. And for the forecast of gross profit margin in 2023, I ask William to help Explain. [Foreign Language]
So, for the gross margin for the full year of 2023, we are confident that in the Q4 of 2023, the vehicle gross margin will go back to 18% to 20% due to several factors. The first one is of our product portfolio. Starting from the second quarter of this year, we are going to start the delivery of vehicle models with higher vehicle gross margins.
The second factor is just like you mentioned, recently, we have witnessed the cost reductions of the raw materials, including the lithium carbonate, chips and other commodities. So, we believe this will also contribute to our vehicle gross margin improvement in this year, especially when it comes to the lithium carbonate cost, we have witnessed significant cost reductions.
We have also engaged discussions with the upstream companies in the battery supply chain. We stand there are some capacities reserved for the lithium carbonate this year. And starting from this year, we are going to see more output from the upstream capacities.
At the same time, considering the market demand, we believe the demand probably is not going to be strong compared with the past. But if we balance the supply and the demand regarding the lithium carbonate we believe probably in the fourth quarter of this year is quite likely the lithium carbonate will go down to probably around RMB200,000 or even lower.
The third factor, we believe, is that starting from the third quarter of this year, we're going to start more product deliveries. This is mainly because more new products will be delivered to our users starting from the second quarter of this year.
So, we believe with the ramp-up of the vehicle deliveries, the amortization rate of the fixed cost will also improve. So, our target still remains that we can achieve the vehicle gross margin of 18% to 20%, and we're very confident that we can achieve that.
[Foreign Language]
For the first quarter of this year, we believe that we're going to face more pressure on the vehicle gross margin, considering the overall situation, because this is a transitional period for the company when it comes to the vehicle sales because we are transitioning into a new technology platform for our product portfolio to the NT2.0. So it means that for the existing generation of the ES8, ES6 and EC6, we won't need to have some measures to accommodate the subsidy reduction as well as some subsidization of the show cards.
At the same time, when it comes to the production capacities because we need to prepare for the launch of the new generation ES8, ES6 and EC6 in our Factory I. So we need to do some modifications on the tooling of the production line, this has affected the output of the Factory I in the first quarter, which result in a higher vehicle cost of our products. So at the same time, when it comes to the specific quarter, that is the first quarter of this year, we will also see that EC5 contribute as a large portion of the overall vehicle delivery, which will also affect the gross margin in the first quarter. Thank you, Tim. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee with Bank of America. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is related to operating expense. So in the past, you -- William mentioned that R&D per quarter is expected to be around RMB 3 billion. But this year -- this quarter, we saw that the expense is close to RMB 4 billion. So we want to understand if there is a new guidance for sales and marketing as well as R&D expense? Hi, Ming, this is Stanley. The guidance for R&D expense, I think we keep this guidance. And our average base for each quarter of 2023, we will -- the non-GAAP R&D expense will be around RMB 3 billion to RMB 3.5 billion.so that's for R&D expense. And for SG&A, as mentioned by William along with the start of user delivery of our NIO NT2.0 product in Q2, we think our sales efficiency will be improved gradually, and the ratio effecting versus sales revenue is expected to drop significantly. So that's for the first question. Thank you, Ming. [Foreign Language] Just to add to Stanley's point, regarding the SG&A, because we also need to consider the investment for the European market. For the European market, right now, we are still at a relatively early stage in terms of the vehicle sales and the deliveries. We believe this is more like an investment period for our global market expansion. [Foreign Language] So my second question is related to product pipeline. So this year, you will have a NIO ES8, ES6 and EC6, -- ET7 and EC5 version. So what will be the time for ES6 and EC6 to be delivered? Besides that, for ES7 and the ET7 where you have a facelift version to further improve your autonomous driving function as well as marketing function? Could you also elaborate your rough product pipeline for 2024, include the second brand? [Foreign Language] Thank you for your question. Actually, for the second quarter of this year, we are -- according to our latest plan, we expect to launch four NIO models, including our most important product, probably that is the ES6, and in July, we plan to deliver the ES6 model. Actually, this is a little bit late compared with our previous plan because of the previous plan is that in the second quarter of this year, we are going to deliver all the five new models. But we will -- that probably it's better for us to have some breathing room between different product launches. So we can probably ensure much higher quality of the products and also make sure the teams have a much better pace the product deliveries and sales.
In terms of the product upgrades, we have been continuously making product improvements and we will keep the market informed if there's any kind of update. When it comes to the product launch cadence for the next year, I think probably, this is not the right timing for us to share those information, because right now, I believe the teams are facing tremendous pressure, we can deliver the five NIO models this year with very high standards. But all in all, we have the over on pace and over own schedules when it comes to our new product launch and also of a new brand and in terms of the product launch cadence and of a new brand, everything is on track according to our plan. The next question comes from Wang Bin with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. I actually got two questions about guidance. Number one is about the volume for full year still maintain guidance for 250,000? Because given the recently in the price by the competitors and first quarter delivery, you actually earlier [indiscernible] of the product. So we do actually maintain the full year volume guidance of about 250,000? Number one. Number two, you actually mentioned earlier the number four quarter for NIO brands that are known turn on to profitable, given the change in the internal competition, do you actually maintain the same guidance? Thank you. [Foreign Language] In -- for the full year of 2023, we are confident that we can achieve our targets. After we complete our product deliveries, we believe that we will see some upside momentum for our vehicle deliveries. For this year, we are going to deliver five new product based on the NT2.0 technology platform.
After all of our product portfolio transition to the NT2.0 platform, it means that we are going to enter a very strong product cycle. We believe that this can actually improve our team efficiency much better, because the teams don't need to sell two generation products at the same time.
After we transition all the product portfolio into the technology platform 2.0, we believe we are going to cover probably 80% of the mainstream vehicle models for the BMW, Audi and Mercedes and when you compare our product with their products, we believe our product competitiveness is much stronger.
The second driver is going to be of charging a swapping network. This year, we plan to deploy additional 1,000 power swap stations to cover more market. Especially, we believe that this is going to help us to boost our demand in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.
Probably some of you know that for over current vehicle deliveries, over 50% of our vehicle deliveries happened in Shanghai, Chuzhou and [Indiscernible]. So at the same time, if you look at the overall vehicle delivery landscape of those products, it means that we have a huge potential to explore in other cities and the regions.
So we believe with the deployment of the additional 1,000 power swap stations, so we can cover more users and also improve the experience of the existing users, which can also support our vehicle demand growth in other different cities and the regions as well.
At the same time, when we look at the software features and functions that are planned to be released on the NIO technology platform 2.0, we believe will also contribute to other vehicle demand. Just like I mentioned in the recent week, the engage -- the mileage of the NIO -- NOP+ Beta is over 1.75 million kilometers. All of our products come standard with the strong computing power and the center suite. So this actually provides a huge foundation for us to have a closed loop of data management.
If you look at all the test by the third parties or by the professional media, NOP+ Beta ranked the first in all those tests. So we believe, together with other improvements in terms of the digital corporate and as well as the audio systems and other softwares and features in our products, this will significantly boost the product competitiveness of our products. Because when you look at the competitors or the peers in the market, most competitors, they offer those functions and features as an option, but for us because everything comes as a standard. So it means that we will have a huge room to upgrade the experience of our users.
[Foreign Language] In a nutshell, our target is still to double the volume in this year, and our teams are quite confident to achieve this target. When it comes to the profitability, this is closely bundled together with the gross margin. So if the raw material cost reduction can be of expectations, like I explained before then for the fourth quarter, we believe this probably can still achieve the target that we said before.
But when we made the plan to become positive, we didn't consider the strategic new business investments. So aiming to that for the fourth quarter of this year of a target is that put aside the investment for the strategic NIO businesses. Of our NIO brand, the main business of the NIO brand can still achieve breakeven. Thank you. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Yuqian Ding with HSBC. Please go ahead. Thanks, team. Yuqian, here. I got two. First, on ET5. We noticed order book contraction on this flagship volume model ET5. How would the management look at stabilized the monthly sales volume on ET5 still 10,000 per month? What's the key driver to support? Is it broadly affected demand related or any specific service network expansion supported?
The second question is on lithium to margin. The lithium price is correcting. We talked about before about RMB100,000 per ton price correction roughly released 2% margin. So, roughly, we might get a 4% to 8% buffer this year? Can we keep them all or we might have to pass some to the consumers given the universal pricing pressure? On that notion, will you take the [indiscernible] to get lower lithium price, but to lock up more softening [ph] share with them? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question. Starting from the second quarter of this year, we are going to gradually launch and deliver all the products based on the new technology platform 2.0. When it comes to the total product portfolio, we can look at them into three different dimensions.
The first one is the volume driver that is the ET5, ES6, and the ET5 Touring that we haven't released, but I believe everyone knows. So, if we combine the ET5, ET5 Touring, and the ES6 together, we believe it's possible for us to achieve 20,000 units per month if we consider the addressable market of--
When it comes to the second dimension, that is the volume contributor that includes the ET7, ES7, and the ES8. We believe for those models; each model can achieve delivery volume around 2,000 to 4,000 per month. And if we combine them together, and for this volume contributor segment, this property can contribute 8,000 to 10,000 units for overall vehicle delivery and sales.
For the third dimension that is the brand shaper that is over Coupe SUV, the EC7 and the EC6 because coupe SUVs is a relatively niche market and we believe that this can probably help us to better showcase of a branded design and for those users who would like it to be different, and they want to show off their taste and their sense of design then probably they can choose this Brand Shaper products.
Of course, we hope to sell more products including the Brand Shaper but this is a relatively niche market segment. So we believe, it's a Brand Shaper that the EC7 and the EC6, are probably the volume is around 1,000 to 2,000 per month for each product. So, if we look at the complete product portfolio of all those products, we believe those strong product portfolio and diversified product portfolio should be able to support us to achieve a volume of 30,000 units per month. Okay. Ian, this is Steven. I would like to answer your second question about the lithium price. First, it was a great that our GP margin is very sensitive to the lithium price. As you have mentioned, if they -- lithium increased by RMB 100,000 per ton, our GP margin can be boosted by as high as 200% point -- to point. So that means, we expect over brief this year there is a good chance that lithium carbonate price will trade to around RMB 200,000 per ton, and that will offset a good GP market elasticity for NIO.
And if you look at the lithium carbonate price, in the past, it was just like around RMB 100,000 and then they picked around RMB 570,000 in November 2022, which increased the whole EV industry. And then from the beginning of this year, the lithium carbonate price, however, treated around RMB 400,000 per ton. Looking forward on the supply side, as more -- as several battery suppliers invested in the upstream raw material real efforts. And these efforts started to yield meaningful lithium carbonate supply from the second quarter of this year. So from a supply side, we do see a stable increase.
On demand side, yes, that year, the China's EV sales volume almost doubled. But if you look at this year, a good estimation is around 30%. So we expect the gap between the supply and demand will reduce significantly, which will lead to a lower and more recent lithium carbonate price around RMB 2,000 per ton.
Last but not least, when we look at the production cost of lithium carbonate, if you look at the late [indiscernible] plant cost, which is RMB 100,000 to RMB 150,000. So a lithium carbonate price around RMB 200,000 per ton can offer a good profit room for such rapid lines supply to offer stable. So in short, if the recent come price will trade quite a lot this year, and that's good for the whole industry. Thank you, Steven. The next question comes from Paul Gong with UBS. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. The first one is regarding the latest sales trend of ES7 and ET7. I understand that the 866 these three models are phasing out. That is a temporary weekly before switching to the new platform. And I also see you have put a lot of the expectation on the NT2.0 platform products. But what has been driving the weakness of the ES7 and the ET7 recently? Is that due to the immediate hangover effect of the subsidy that cards or is that due to the supply chain bottleneck, or is it like capacity allocation to ET5 that has cannibalized the ES7 and ET7 sales. So what has been the reason for the recent weekly of these two NIO platform kind of flagship models?
My second question is regarding the efficiency improvement. I think William had some spoken in Germany the beginning of this year regarding the key effort of efficiency improvement in 2023. So what has been the key area that you want to improve? We can still see you invest a lot for the future, including the batteries 1,000 working stations to be deployed for this year, including the expansion and NIO house in Europe, but where can we find the efficiency improvements and the expense ratio or reduction for the rest of this year? [Foreign Language] Thank you, Paul, for your question. We can see that for the first two months of this year, the market demand is not that strong, especially when it comes through the demand for the BEV. We see this has suffered some impact. But if you look at all the peers, I believe most peers have published their delivery results for the first two months. This is actually affecting everyone in the market. I believe a very important factor is the subsidy cuts. Starting from this year, there will be no more subsidies. And this will create some short-term effect on everyone in this market. But when it comes to NIO specifically, because we have a relatively higher MSRP, so this impact on us is actually relatively lower compared with others.
Starting from the February, we can see the demand is recovering week by week, including the ES7 and the ET7 compared with January. So for the ES7 and ET7, we can see that in their specific segment, they're still very competitive. So we are very confident when it comes to the demand for the ES7 and the ET7 in the long run. But in the short term, yes, we are facing some pressure. I believe there are multiple factors we have to consider probably like the Spring Festival and the low seasonalities of the auto market as well as the subsidies or other micro environment. But still, we are very confident with our product competitiveness in their specific segment.
Yes, actually, the efficiency improvement is the most important half for NIO this year. Last year because of the project progress and we have multiple projects going in parallel. So the human resources increased is much faster compared with the past. But when it comes to the efficiency improvements, we are not talking about the cutting projects. We believe that the efficiency is more about improving the efficiency per person. We can improve the overall efficiency of the whole organization when it comes to the R&D, sales and service and also management.
At the same time, we also need to do some prioritization of a different kind of a project, including the R&D projects and also the CapEx investment. So it means that we need to look at the priority in terms of the timeline and also the investment. So over – all in all the efficiency improvement were more focused on the output and the quality of the output as well as to the prioritization. Thank you, Paul. Thank you. The next question comes from Nick Lai with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] My question is very fast. Yeah, the first question is about the cooperation agreement with CATL and the pricing arrangement with CATL and also an – can you pre-update us statement solid actually. And secondly, can we talk about the potential investment size for new initiatives? Thank you. [Foreign Language] Nick, thank you for your question. For this year, we will introduce a new battery partners. I believe, probably around March, we're going to launch new battery packs in collaboration with ALB. At the same time, we will also keep our long-term strategic relationship with CATL, but right now, we're in discussion with CATL in terms of the new agreement, but we haven't signed the agreement yet. I believe that the discussion direction is basically that the battery companies will start to work in parallel with the auto companies, and we are going to share the volatilities of the raw material cost together throughout the supply chain.
And when it comes to the semi solid battery, we have a sense of battery teams to help our partners in the semi-solid battery, make sure they can have a small mass production for the batteries. But we are really sorry for the delay, but probably this will be available. We estimate this will be available probably after several months.
Regarding the investment for the new strategic -- for the strategic new businesses, for the full year, we estimate that this will be around RMB 4 billion to RMB 5 billion. So, if we break it down, then it means that probably around RMB 1 billion every quarter. The overall target for the company is that for the group, we still aim to achieve a breakeven for the company in 2024. The next question comes from Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, thank you for taking the questions. First one, can you maybe go over some feedback you've gotten in Europe? You've been in Norway for over a year. You recently launched in several other countries. What has been the user feedback? And what is a reasonable amount of volume we could expect there in the next few years? And then second question really quick. On the other margin, it's still quite negative. It's been quite negative. When can we see some recovery in that level? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
Thank you for your question. European markets, we have delivered our products to some users, and those users have been speaking very highly about our products. We have been tracking the user satisfaction rate on a weekly basis. And we believe that this is basically means of expectations.
The one aspect that we think is lagging behind is the infrastructure building in Europe. Right now, we have around 11 power swap stations. This is actually far behind our original planning. That's the same with the deployment of the new houses in Europe. So we believe because of the infrastructure deployment in Europe is lagging behind, which also affected the delivery and the sales in the European market.
When we look at the user demand and the test drive data, we can see there are some improvements on a weekly basis. And the team building is also on track for the European market. But the only thing that we need to speed up is the infrastructure building in the European market.
For this year, we believe the sales is not of top priority. To be honest, our target in terms of the sales volume for the European market this year is probably less than 10,000. And we believe the most important thing for us is actually the user satisfaction rate. For the long run, we are very confident about our performance in the European market. When we consider the user satisfaction rate that we are seeing right now and the competitiveness of our product portfolio in the market. Okay. For the second question about the loss. As the sales in the car products growing in China, the losses from vehicle repair and maintenance continuous scenario. But we kept expanding our power swap station network in 2022, which drove the loss increase of other loss and we will stick to the continuous deployment of power network and plan to newly build 1,000 power swap stations in 2023, as William mentioned. Therefore, we expect the loss of other business will continue to increase in 2023. But the continuous expansion of our power infrastructure will not only help us improve our user satisfaction but also help us to sell more cars in the market. So that's all. Thank you, Edison Thank you, Edison. The next question comes from Jane Chang with CICC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]
So, my first question is about with the further increase in the number of our distribution stocks, how we will cover more loyal tier cities, considering that these customers in those markets are very sticky to traditional luxury brands. So, will we make some more targeted adjustments in our products and marketing? [Foreign Language]
Thank you, [indiscernible] for your question. When it comes to the expansion into the sub-tier cities, we're not talking about the deployment of the NIO houses or NIO spaces. We believe that the more efficient way is to deploy the power swap stations in the sub-tier cities. For example, in Shandong province, [indiscernible], there's some growing user base and the users at the beginning, they actually grow the user base themselves and then they worked together with us to deploy the power swap stations that -- the first of our swap stations.
Then later, we deployed the second power swap stations in this town. And now this town has around 500 users. So, for those sub-tier cities, especially when it comes to the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, we think the more efficient way for us to grow our user base deploy the power swap stations.
Previously, our power swap station is mainly deployed in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, but this is our strategy this year to make sure we can deploy more power swap stations in the Tier 3 and the Tier 4 cities. [Foreign Language] My second question about -- we can see that at the beginning of this year, the press competition in the energy vehicle market has become mild. And also, we are positioning on -- positioning luxury brand market, where we can still see a greater press reduction in both energy new energy and ICE e-vehicle market. So we will be more aggressive in the price strategy of NIO models. Have you considered the way of reducing some consideration and reduce -- to introduce more models with lower price? [Foreign Language] Our consistent strategy is to keep our product pricing stable. So we do not have any plan to cut the features and functions for our product. So each of our products in our portfolio, we believe when we look at the features and functions, and the performance of those products as well as the user benefits. We think every aspect of the product is well deserved and well established when it comes to the product pricing and strategy. So for the NIO brand, we do not have any plan to cut the features and functions of product. And I think that, this is consistent of branding and the pricing strategy because of low pricing is not a part of the strategy or the DNA of the new brand. Thank you, Tim.

[Interpreted] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2023 first quarter earnings call.
In the first quarter of 2023, NIO delivered a total of 31,041 smart electric vehicles, up 20.5% year-over-year. In April and May, NIO delivered 6,658 and 6,155 vehicles, respectively. We expect the total deliveries in the second quarter of this year to be between 23,000 and 25,000 units. As we ramp up the production of the All-New ES6 and other new models, we are confident in continuously driving up our delivery volume.
Next, I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D, and operations.
On May 24, we launched the All-New ES6, an all-around midsize smart electric SUV, and started its delivery the next day. The product quality of the All-New ES6 has been widely acclaimed by the first batch of users.
In May, we also started the user delivery of the 2023 NIO ET7, and the flagship coupe SUV EC7, coming with more than 15 new features and enhancements. The 2023 NIO ET7 continues to lead the change in the premium smart electric mid-large sedan market. As a flagship coupe SUV, EC7 inherent NIO's high-performance DNA and both ultimate riding and handling experience.
NIO's product quality and the safety also recognized by authoritative institutions. On April 24, NIO ET5 was rated good, the highest safety level by China Insurance Automobile Safety Index, or C-IASI. In J.D. Power's 2023 China New Energy Vehicle Initial Quality Study released on June 1, NIO ES6 won first place in the premium BEV segment for the fourth consecutive year. Also in J.D. Power's 2023 NEV-APEAL Study, which evaluates new energy vehicles' performance, execution and layout, NIO ET7 ranked number one among premium BEVs.
We plan to launch the NIO ET5 Touring on June 15 and start the delivery in the same month. As the world's first smart electric tourer, the ET5 Touring is designed to cover diversified scenarios for both individual and family users, significantly improving our competitiveness in the premium family vehicle market.
Besides, NIO's flagship SUV, the All-New ES8 will also commence delivery in the [indiscernible]. The new EC6, our second generation midsize smart coupe SUV, will be launched and delivered in the third quarter. As we proceed with the product platform transition, NIO's complete NT2.0 line up featuring eight different products will form a combined force to better cater to the diverse needs in the premium smart EV market, and provide users with more experiences beyond expectations.
In June, NIO's smart system Banyan will be upgraded to version 2.0. This release includes over 120 new features and enhancements. By connecting NIO's products, services and the community in a more seamless way, Banyan 2.0 will deliver a one-of-a-kind digital experience. It's particularly worth mentioning that Banyan 2.0 provides a new feature that is automatic planning of charging and swapping routes. Enabled by new Power Cloud and the comprehensive power infrastructure, it can let users plan for charging and swapping along the navigation route for long-distance trips with just one tap.
In terms of intelligent driving, NIO has released Navigate on Pilot Plus Beta, or NOP Plus Beta, to all NT2.0 users. Based on in-house-developed NIO intelligent driving technologies and closed-loop data management, NOP Plus Beta has made significant improvements in making users' journeys more reassuring, comfortable and efficient. In Banyan 2.0, NOP Plus will be using NIO's proprietary BEV model and occupancy network perception and the large language model trained with the large-scale data sets for planning and control. The experience of NOP Plus will be further enhanced.
In the meantime, we have started to test our Power Swap Pilot for Highway at scale and we'll make it available for 40 Power Swap stations on highways starting from the third quarter this year. This feature will be gradually rolled out to more Power Swap stations with users of -- with which users can enjoy more seamless and navigate on pilot experience from Point A to Point B on highways.
With respect to the sales and service network, we now have 365 NIO Houses and the NIO Spaces in 136 cities, and 359 NIO service centers and NIO delivery centers in 196 cities.
In terms of the charging and swapping network, on April 13, the first batch of NIO Power Swap Station 3.0 started operation. The Power Swap Station 3.0 features the synchronization of three operating positions, making it faster than the previous generation with higher service capacity and more intelligent experiences. So far, NIO has installed 1,474 Swap stations worldwide, including 119 third-generation Power Swap stations, and has completed over 23 million Swaps for users. NIO has also installed 7,000 Power Chargers and 8,800 destination chargers. In fact, our Power Map has also been connected to over 1.1 million third-party chargers globally.
On April 17, NIO's first 500-kilowatt power chargers went online, completing the new generation of Power Up station, which is an integrated station featuring 500-kilowatt power chargers and the Power Swap station 3.0. Through efficient coordination between chargers and the Swap stations and flexible capacity distribution, the Power Chargers can operate more stably and efficiently.
On April 22, the fourth NIO User Council was established after the NIO User Council member election, which was actively participated by NIO users worldwide. This year NIO Users Trust will continue their work, centering on public welfare, user care and common growth.
On March 26, further deepening our partnership with World Wide Fund for Nature, WWF, NIO announced to join the Science Based Targets initiative and plan to set a science-based target within the next two years with the goal of contributing to global sustainable development and leading up to the Blue Sky commitment.
In the face of the changing market situation, we will timely adjust our sales and the marketing priorities to ensure the market competitiveness of our products and services. In the second half of 2023, with the entire NT2.0 product line up entering the premium battery electric vehicle market and 1,000 new Power Swap stations have put into operation. NIO's product competitiveness powered by our decisive efforts into developing full stack R&D capabilities and core technologies of smart EVs will be gradually unleashed, which in turn can better prepare us for the increasingly intensifying competition at the next-stage.
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the first quarter. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William.
I will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2023. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I'll reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the first quarter were RBM10.7 billion, representing an increase of 7.7% year-over-year and a decrease of 33.5% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales.
Vehicle sales in the first quarter were RMB9.2 billion, representing a decrease of 0.2% year-over-year and a decrease of 37.5% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly due to lower average selling price as a result of higher proportion of ET5 and 75 kilowatt standard-range battery pack deliveries, partially offset by an increase in delivery volume. The decrease in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to a decrease in delivery volume, and lower average selling price as a result of higher proportion of ET5 and 75 kilowatt standard-range battery pack deliveries.
Other sales in the first quarter were RMB1.5 billion, representing an increase of 117.8% year-over-year and increase of 11.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the increase in sales of accessories, provision of repair and maintenance services, provision of auto financing services, sales of used cars and provision of power solutions, as a result of continued growth of our users. The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the increase in provision of auto financing services, sales of accessories, provision of repair and maintenance services, provision of power solutions and sales of used cars, as a result of continued growth of our users, and partially offset by a decrease in revenue from rendering of research and development services.
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2023 was 1.5% compared with 14.6% in the first quarter of 2022 and 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in gross margin year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to decreased vehicle margin. More specifically, vehicle margin in the first quarter was 5.1% compared with 18.1% in the first quarter of 2022 and 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to changes in product mix and increased battery cost per unit. The decrease in vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to changes in product mix and increased promotion discounts for the previous generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6, which were partially offset by the inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and losses on purchase commitments for the previous generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6 in the fourth quarter of 2022.
R&D expenses in the first quarter were RMB3.1 billion, representing an increase of 74.6% year-over-year, a decrease of 22.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year was mainly attributed to increased personnel costs in research and development functions and the increased share-based compensation expenses recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses quarter-over-quarter reflected fluctuations due to different designs and development stages of new products and technologies.
SG&A expenses in the first quarter were RMB2.4 billion, representing an increase of 21.4% year-over-year and a decrease of 30.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year was primarily due to the increase in personnel costs related to sales and general corporate functions and increase in expenses related to the company's sales and service network expansion. The decrease in SG&A expenses quarter-to-quarter was mainly due to the decrease in sales and marketing activities and professional services.
Loss from operations in the first quarter was RMB5.1 billion, representing an increase of 133.6% year-over-year and a decrease of 24.1% quarter-over-quarter.
Net loss in the first quarter was RMB4.7 billion, representing an increase of 165.9% year-over-year and a decrease of 18.1% quarter-to-quarter. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the first quarter was RMB4.8 billion, representing increase of 163.2% year-over-year and a decrease of 17.8% quarter-over-quarter.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term deposits was RMB37.8 billion as of March 31, 2023.
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to proceed our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]
So my first question is about volume and cost control, because NIO has been investing more aggressively since 2021 on new models, sales and marketing and energy replenishment network. So in light of the challenging industry and macro outlook, would NIO consider streamlining the model portfolio and cutting back on investment in some projects like smartphone, battery, chipset and refocus resource on a few flagship models? And separately, does NIO still stick to its original schedule to launch our mass market brand ALPS next year? So that's my first question. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Tim, for your question. As we have mentioned, the market competition is intensifying and we do face a lot of changes in the market dynamics. For the NIO technology platform 2.0, we are about to show the whole lineup of the eight products based on the NT2.0, and these eight products will enter the market in the near term, gradually.
The current focus of us is to make sure we have the new organization structure to have a more targeted sales strategy and the marketing strategy for all the eight products to reach its own target user groups. Because when we design those products, we do have a specific positioning of different products in their specific segment and target groups. So the kind of challenge for us is to make sure our marketing and the sales team can be more dedicated on these eight products in terms of showroom layout and the product reach and the marketing reach and the distribution of the resources at the sales and marketing teams.
We want to make sure for each product, we have dedicated teams to take responsibilities in terms of sales and marketing efforts. Of course, for those key products, we will put more resources to make sure we can reach much better sales performance. But just like I mentioned, the focus for us now is to make sure we can have more dedicated resources for the eight products separately and to make sure they can achieve good market share in terms of their specific segment.
Yes, of course, we need to be more agile in terms of face the challenges of the changing market situation to ensure our competitiveness in terms of the products and services.
Regarding the topics of the R&D projects, overall speaking we would like to insist on our big directions in terms of the R&D projects. In the short-term, yes, we do have some pressures, but we think it's really important and necessary for us to focus on those R&D capability building to build of our long-term competitiveness. But at the same time, based on our resources and the priorities of the company, we can adjust the pace of the investment for all those different R&D projects.
For the question regarding ALPS project, our timing for ALPS brand is still the same, that is the second half of 2024, where we plan to launch the ALPS products at that time, and we would choose the specific timings for those different products. However, at the same time, we want to make sure for the ALPS products we can have a much faster pace in terms of the go-to-market because these can help us to improve the efficiency and have a much better planning of the resources, especially at the marketing and sales front. [Foreign Language]
So, my second question is about the new ES6. The second quarter guidance came in stronger than market expectation, which could [indiscernible] call to like 3,000 to 4,000 units of additional sales of the new ES6. So, could you share a little bit more about the order intake of the new ES6 since it's launched to date? And is there is any bottleneck to the delivery of new ES6?
In the meantime, are you still expecting the sales aggregate of ET5, ES6, and the upcoming ET5 Touring to achieve 20,000 a month? And when do you expect to achieve that [modeling] (ph) target? So that's my second question. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Tim. ES6 is very well received by the users and also received very good feedback in the media. We think the order performance has reached our expectations and the test drive conversion rate of the ES6 actually reached a record high in the history of NIO, so that's why we're very confident in terms of the sales performance of ES6.
At this stage, especially in June, we need to focus on the ramp-up of the ES6 first. But for the targets in July is that we want to achieve 10,000 units in terms of the production and delivery. We're very confident to achieve this target in July and the supply chain team, manufacturing team and the other teams are making all sorts of preparations to make sure we can achieve this objective.
Regarding the ET5, ET5 Touring and ES6 overall volume, we believe there is opportunity for us to still achieve 20,000 units in one month. The big challenge for us right now is more about the ET5, because if we look at the ET5's pricing, we can see that the last year, we still have around RMB12,000 subsidies for the users, and at the same time, users can get the home chargers free of charge last year, but now users will need to pay for the home chargers for the ET5. So, net-net speaking probably for the ET5, if we make the apple-to-apple comparison, it's probably like a RMB20,000 more expensive this year. This is the fact and the challenge we need to face. But what we need to focus on is to make sure we can find a better way to expand the user needs and the demand.
The more challenge we are facing right now is about the ET5, but just like I mentioned, we're going to launch the ET5 Touring on June 15. This is going to help us to improve our overall product competitiveness, because we believe ET5 Touring can cater to the diversified needs of individuals and the family users and this can help us to boost our competitive -- of our product competitiveness in this specific market segment.
Thank you, Tim. Thank you, William. Thank you. Your next question comes from Bin Wang from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. I've got two questions. Number one is about the margin outlook. We've reached [10,000 per month] (ph) for ES6 in the third quarter. So what's the gross margin expectation we can have for the third quarter second half? That is the number one question about gross margin guidance.
[Foreign Language] Hi, Bin, this is Stanley. As William mentioned, with the delivery of our NT2.0 product with higher price from Q2 and Q3, the average selling price and gross profit margin per car will recover. So, we are confident that the gross profit margin will start to recover to double-digits in Q3 and over 15% in Q4. Yes, thank you. Okay, great. My second question about, any further fundraising demands are needed, because right now people worry about your net cash position, which declined quite fast. And so, can you just provide some update about your potential fundraising, especially on NIO China IPO?
[Foreign Language] [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Bin, for your question. Yes, for this year, if we look at the first quarter and the second quarter, because of the delivery performance, which is actually lesser than that of the fourth quarter last year, so this has affected our operating cash flow. But together with over delivery volume ramp-up in the third quarter, we believe that the operating cash flow will also improve.
Currently, we believe our cash is sufficient to support the company's business development. As a public listed company, we make very prudent management of our cash positions and at the same time, we do have all the different channels to do the fundraising in different markets. But this year, we have made some adjustments in terms of our cash spending. For example, we have delayed our CapEx investment and we have also delayed some R&D projects. At the same time, in terms of global market expansion, we believe it's more important for us to focus on the markets that we have already entered, for example, for those countries where we have already entered in Europe. So, if we have any kind of plans in the capital markets, we will, of course, let everyone know.
Thank you, Wang Bin. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from BofA. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you, William and Steven. So, I also have two questions. My first question is, what is the battery price decline in the first quarter? And how much does the battery price to -- help gross margin in the first quarter? And also, could you also comment the second quarter and the third quarter's battery price trend? That's my first question. Thank you. Hi, Ming. Generally, the price of lithium carbonate decreased a little bit from Q1. So this led to certainly increase of our gross profit margin. Regarding the amount wise, I think [indiscernible] per car. But recently, I think we can also see the lithium carbonate price also recovered a little bit to RMB310,000 per ton. So, well, the change of lithium price will bring uncertainty to our gross profit margin, yes. Generally -- that's generally the impact of lithium. Thank you, Stanley. And my question is regarding your latest CapEx and the operating expense guidance, because I think William just mentioned that you are starting to control certain investments, especially for some long-term investments, but are you able to give some new guidance, if there is any? I remember last year, the CapEx is around RMB10 billion. Yes, so, I want to know your guidance for this year for CapEx and OpEx. Thank you. Yes, Ming. Our CapEx will still concentrate on the construction of Power Swap stations, charging networks, so it's network and also tooling and production facilities for our new models. We will well control the cadence of those investments. But at this moment, I don't think we can give clear guidance of CapEx investment for this year. Yes, we will make adjustments dynamically in line with the spending and also the status, yes. Yes. Also any guidance on operating expense? Sorry. Okay. Regarding operating expense, one is for the R&D expense. The upcoming years remains to be the crucial stage for our R&D and also mass production of our core technology as new models. So, our average in each quarter of 2023, the non-GAAP R&D expense will be kept at RMB3 billion to RMB3.5 billion per quarter. Yes, we will also manage the spending curve and also keep improving our system efficiency.
And for SG&A expense, yes, we can see a decline in Q1. The main reason is because of the reduced marketing activities and also the seasonality impact of Chinese New Year, along with more marketing events like Auto Show, Road Show, and also the launch of new models. The SG&A total amount will increase from Q2, but the efficiency will be improved from Q3 since our NT2.0 products will be launched and more volume will be realized. I mean, that's the guidance for the OpEx of the next quarters. Thank you, Stanley. Thank you. Thank you, Ming. Hi, operator, next question, please. Thank you. Your next question comes from Yuqian Ding from HSBC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] Yes, go ahead. [Foreign Language]
So, I've got two questions. The first is, do we have plan to introduce any budget version of our existing model, especially the potential volume carrier ET5 by lower price and lower content to access more volume?
And the second question, you talked about the dial down a little bit on OpEx front. Generally, does that also affect or postpone our breakeven point of the year? [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Yuqian, for your question. We understand that there are many different kinds of pricing movements in the market, but first, regarding ET5, so, we don't think it's reasonable prices to have a budget version of the ET5, because of our philosophy is that we believe the different configurations or the important configurations should come as a standard for all of our NT2.0 products. For example, the dual motors, [AD suites] (ph), and other important functions and features, we believe those standard of package philosophy can serve the long-term interests to our users.
But at the same time, we do have some flexibilities in many other different approaches. For example, user rights, such as the free battery swapping. When we make those kinds of considerations and adjustment, of course, the important thing is to make sure we can put the users' interest first. So, when we decide to make those kinds of adjustments, we also need to consider the interest of our installed base.
For the second question regarding the breakeven point, according to the current situation, we do think probably we need to delay our breakeven point to within one year. And we think this is probably a reasonable assumption. Thank you, Eve Tang. Thank you. Your next question comes from Nick Lai from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]
My first question is really following up on the previous question regarding cash burn and CapEx cycle and so on. So you just mentioned that your push back R&D expense and so on. And -- but I'm more curious about our '24, '25 planning. How should we expect the CapEx or cash burn into '24 and '25? Would that be flat or up or down compared with 2023? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your question, Nick. Regarding the dynamic and the fluid market situation, we understand it's important for us to control the risks and to keep as a stable and sound business operations.
For the ALPS brand, basically, the project is moving forward according to our plan. For the production site, we believe the current production capacity is sufficient to support the needs of new brand and ALPS brand. So, it means that in terms of production facilities and the capacities, there is no need for big CapEx investments.
In the market front, we -- starting from this year, we should have sufficient Power Swap stations to support both brands to share the Power Swap stations. Previously, we mentioned that probably for the go-to-market of ALPS brand, we do need to make some investments in terms of CapEx and OpEx. But we would like to control the pace of the go-to-market cadence to make sure we can have much faster movement and the cadence and have a much agile mode to operate the go-to-market of that ALPS brand. So, this can help us to save the resources and the capital.
In terms of the cash management, of course, as a publicly listed company, we need to be very prudent in terms of the cash management. For the financing channels, we do have different channels in terms of the RMB and U.S. dollar capital markets. So for us, we think cash is not going to be a big issue for the company. But at the same time, we still need to make a refined management of our cash and also the working capital of the company. [Foreign Language]
My second question is really simple, really about the product mix, yes. Is new product ES6 is going to account a meaningful portion of the volume? And how should we think about the contribution from these four major models? And how should we think about the product mix going forward? Thanks. Hi, Nick. Regarding the volume percentage of ET5, ET5 Touring, ES6 and EC6, I think, from a long-run, the percentage will be 80% around. Yes, but from -- and from the long run as I mentioned earlier, this year, I think with all NT2.0 product launched, our gross profit margin can recover to 15%. And long-term, considering the cost advantage brought by the in-house technology and capability and also the innovative supply chain developments, the NT2.0 product gross profit margin target will be still be 20% from a long-run. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. Please go ahead. So, my first question is regarding the dual-motor sales front. It seems that a few recent new models all share a similarity with strong start, but after a few months, subsequent declines. Does our ES6 also face such kind of challenges or how should we avoid this happening again? [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Paul, for your question. Last year, we launched three products: ET7, ES7 and ET5. To be honest, in terms of the recent performance of these three products, including the second quarter, we understand the market performance of these three products is lagging behind of our expectations.
If we look at the factors that affecting the performance of these three products, just like I mentioned before, last year, the users purchased those three products, they have more user rights and benefits, and they can enjoy the national subsidies. But this year, for the users purchasing these three products, apple-to-apple comparison, the cost increase is around RMB10,000 to RMB20,000. So, at the same time, if we look at the macro environment, we can see the market competition is also getting intensified. So some users are choosing probably some other NIO brands or some traditional brands of our products. This is one factor.
And another factor is internal cannibalization or competition. For example, some ES7 users may decide to choose ES6 instead of the ES7, and for some ET5 users, probably they decided to wait a little bit for the ET5 Touring. This is the situation that we're facing right now. That is why we decided to probably -- we're going to make some adjustments in the near term in terms of our sales channel and network as well as our organizational structure and our sales and marketing strategy and policies.
But for the five new products based on the NIO Technology platform 2.0 that we launched this year, we do not have this concern. The first product we launched this year is EC7. After the delivery of EC7, we can see the demand is actually quite stable. As for the ES6, just now I have mentioned that we are very confident about the sales performance of ES6 after the product ramp-up. And then, for this year, we are very confident of our speaking for all the new products we launched this year, including the ES8. We're about to start the delivery of the ES8 in the near term. And currently, we can see that the reservation order performance is actually higher than our expectations.
We believe, right now the current pace of our product quality and the product go-to-market is actually much better than before. So, we believe for these five new products based on the NT2.0 technology platform should be able to reach reasonable performance in terms of the delivery ramp-up. And recently, we have also launched 2023 ET7. After the delivery of ET7, we believe it can also meet our expectations and the auto performance is also quite stable. [Foreign Language]
Sorry, I forget to translate. So, my second question is regarding the margin outlook of the high-end NIO brand versus the low-end ALPS brand. NIO brand remains to be relatively expensive, thanks to the branding and the excellent service company has been offering, but yet to achieve on satisfactory or kind of like excellent margins. So, when you're moving towards ALPS to the relatively lower end, how do you foresee the margin would be like, especially compared to the high-end ones? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your question. Regarding the brand positioning, I believe right now is a very chaotic period for the brand positioning. For the users -- for most of the users, the majority of the times they choose a product based on the price. So, right now, in terms of our product, our service as well as our technology and experience, we believe we are much better than others in those different areas, but the values of our product and services and the technologies are not reflected in the perceived value and the price of the products. This is the reality that we're facing right now, but we believe for the long run, the value of our product and services will be recognized by the users and by the market.
At the same time, we do face some challenges in the macro environment. For example, the lithium carbonate cost has significantly impacted our vehicle gross margin. Back in 2021, we have reached around 20% vehicle gross margin. At that time, we believe the lithium carbonate cost goes back to a reasonable level, we should still have a chance to reach 20% vehicle gross margin.
In the long term, we believe in terms of the economies of scale and the efficiency improvement as well as the vertical integration of our core components and the in-house R&D capabilities, there is a strong base for us to achieve a 20% vehicle gross margin. That's for NIO.
But for ALPS, the strategy is very different, because we believe that in terms of the vehicle gross margin, it's actually more about how you define the products and how we design the product. So, for ALPS it is about finding the best resolution in the specific segment that ALPS brand target is at. For us, if we look at the market, we see some companies, they sell the product at a price of around RMB200,000, but they can still achieve over 20% vehicle gross margin. So, it shows that this is achievable.
For NIO, because we have many high specs configurations in our product, for example, the over 1,000 top computing powers and all those smart features, it will be very difficult for us to lower the cost on those components and this will affect us in terms of lowering the price of our products. But for ALPS is different. When we define ALPS' product, of course, the target for us is to achieve reasonable vehicle gross margin. And we believe it is reasonable and is possible for us to achieve 20% vehicle gross margin. Thank you so much, William, for your time to sharing. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Jing Yang from CICC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]
My first question is about our NOP Plus. Our NOP Plus beta version has been opened for several years -- several months. So, can you share the -- some users' data such as usage time or accumulated mileage or average takeover mileage during this period? And how is their feedback? And we can see the official version will be charged for subscription. So, can you share more of your understanding of subscription charge?
And also in the second quarter of this year, you can see that highway navigation function to swapping stations were launched. So, what do we think of the improvement of customers' experience with this new function?
And last one is, is there any timeframe for our [indiscernible] function in the second half year? [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your question. I will answer the NOP Plus related question and Steven is going to address the question about the Power Swap stations.
For the NOP Plus, right now we have over 50,000 users using the NOP Plus services. And for us, the accumulated mileage of NOP Plus is over 41 million kilometers. And every week the mileage is around 2 million kilometers. We have already started the test of the NOP Plus in the city scenarios and use cases. This year, we're going to accelerate the test of the NOP Plus in the city use cases or the urban use cases. We will also -- when it gets ready, we will also release this feature to the users. Based on our internal evaluation right now, we are very confident regarding the performance of the NOP Plus in the urban scenarios.
At the same time, regarding the NAD, we're also doing some tests. And if in the future the regulations and the laws are in the right place for the NOP Plus release, then we will release the -- sorry, we will release the NAD for our users when the regulation is in the right place. And we believe this is probably -- right now, all the R&D of our NOP Plus and NAD is basically on track and according to our schedule. [Foreign Language]
My second question is about the battery swapping station. We can see that you have gotten nearly 1,500 stations at present, now -- and yearly we can see 200 stations has been added since this year. So, have you seen that denser of our battery swapping stations network has been built and is quite good for ourselves -- of our new models, especially for our penetration of lower-tier cities? Yang, this is Steven. I think the short answer is a very clear, yes. We see -- we have seen a very clear flywheel effect between the Power Swap station network and our sales growth. As just William mentioned, we have already deployed 1,500 Power Swap stations across China. And at the end of the year, the number of Power Swap stations will be right around 2,400. And every day we offer around 60,000 to 70,000 times of Power Swaps to our users. So, in average every day, one Power Swap station offers 40 to 50 times of Power Swaps to our users.
So that means, on one hand, our users rely on Power Swap station as their favorite charging method. On other hand, the Power Swap stations are very efficiently utilized. So that's why we see a clear flywheel effect. And that's why we're very determined to accelerate our Power Swap station deployment and also we're very confident that more Power Swap stations will lead to more sales growth.
And actually in the [indiscernible] and some Tier-1 cities, we have seen that after all the charging experience improves, our volume also grow. So that's why we're very confident that with more and more Power Swap stations penetrate into the low-tier cities, naturally, NIO sales will lead to a very strong momentum or a solid growth in the low-tier cities.
Last, but not least, I think looking forward, as more and more OEMs serious look at Power Swap stations as more or less standard way, the Power Swap stations will become a more and more convenient way for many more EV users. [Foreign Language] Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Yes, hi, just a quick question. Given some of the new ramps with the five-year models, it looks like you're getting a good response from it. Would you expect second half or even third quarter production run rates to get to that 20,000 per month on average? And just wondering what the expectation is on second half to first half deliveries? [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Vijay, for the question. Of course, for us, the target for the second quarter of this year is to deliver over 20,000 units every month and we're very confident to achieve this target. Got it. And just one other question. If you look at some of the subsidiaries -- if you look at some of the subsidiaries moving to Tier-2 cities, is that a near-term -- could that be a challenge for NIO, given you don't have enough Swap stations, et cetera in the Tier-2 cities, et cetera? Thanks. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] This year our target is to deploy 1,000 additional Power Swap stations and the majority of those Power Swap stations will be deployed on highways and some of them will be installed in the Tier-3 and the Tier-4 cities. We believe that this is going to directly boost the sales performance of our products. Actually, in April, we started the deployment of the Power Swap Station 3.0, and we accelerated the deployment in May. In June, we believe we're going to deploy around 100 Power Swap Station 3.0, and we believe gradually from now on, we're going to speed up the deployment of the Power Swap stations. Thank you. Thank you, Vijay. As there are no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, once again, for joining us today.

[Interpreted] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2023 Q2 earnings call.
In the second quarter of 2023, NIO delivered a total of 23,520 smart electric vehicles.
In July 2023, as we started mass production and ramp up of more new models, NIO's monthly delivery volume grew rapidly to 20,462 units, representing a year-over-year growth of 104% and a new monthly high. According to the retail statistics of [Cartrack] (ph), in July, NIO was the best-selling brand in the premium electric vehicle segment with the transaction price of over RMB300,000, claiming a 59% market share.
As NIO completes its product lineup, further expands the sales and service network and the power network, enhances its all-around sales capability and the [role of] (ph) sales and marketing plans, the competitiveness of the NT2 products has been further unleashed. The delivery volume in the third quarter of 2023 is expected to be between 50,000 -- 55,000 and 57,000 units.
And now I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations.
Following the delivery of the flagship coupe SUV EC7, the flagship sedan 2023 new EC7, and the all-round SUV all-new ES6 earlier this year, we started to deliver the smart electric tour ET5 Touring or ET5T for short, and the flagship SUV all-new ES8 in June. In the second quarter, NIO achieved high-quality delivery of five new models, with user satisfaction exceeding our expectations. This also proves NIO's capabilities of conducting fast product iteration and the managing product complexity.
In September, we plan to launch and deliver the new mid-sized coupe SUV EC6, which marks the completion of our product transition to the NT2 platform. With that, NIO's entire NT2 product lineup, featuring eight different models, will have entered the premium BEV market to better cater to the diverse needs of the users in the premium segment and drive the steady growth of deliveries.
NIO's product safety has been highly recognized by authoritative institutions worldwide. On July 12, 2023, NIO's smart electric mid-sized sedan ET5 and the mid large SUV EL7, which is called ES7 in China, both obtained the 5-star safety rating from Euro NCAP, making NIO the first car brand receiving the 5-star rating since Euro NCAP adopted the new testing protocols for 2023.
Enabled by the full stack technologies developed in-house and the closed-loop data management, NIO has made significant progress in the assisted and intelligent driving. User base and engagement continue to grow. At present, over 100,000 NIO users have activated Navigate on Pilot Plus, or NOP Plus, and have driven on it for over 80 million kilometers. The mileage penetration rate of NOP Plus has reached 53%. In the meantime, we have carried out multiple rounds of early bird programs in Beijing and Shanghai for NOP Plus in all operational domains, including in urban environments.
In terms of the sales and service network, so far, we have 420 NIO House, NIO space and pop-up stores in 143 cities and 304 service centers as well as 58 delivery centers in 201 cities worldwide. Since July, we have started to take a more active manner in expanding the user touchpoints and sales channels and enlarging the sales team in China. These actions will further increase our sales capabilities and propelling sales growth.
As for the charging and swapping network, to date, we have installed 1,747 power swap stations worldwide and provided more than 27 million battery swaps. Our expressway battery swap network in China consists of 476 swap stations along the 10 major expressways, connecting 68 major cities. We've also deployed over 7,900 power chargers and 9,700 destination chargers. NIO has become the automotive brand with the most public chargers and the most chargers along expressways in China. In the meantime, NIO's charging map has connected with over 1.36 million third-party charges worldwide.
On July 20, NIO announced the flexible battery upgrade service by day, providing users with more options and fulfilling more use cases.
In July, we organized the host city election for NIO Day 2023, and the city of Xi'an was voted by new users as the host city this year.
On August 20, we partnered with Worldwide Fund for Nature and Qilian Mountain National Park in installing the world's first photovoltaic self-consumption system with V2G capability. It features solar power stations, V2G chargers and battery electric vehicles. Moreover, we initiated the Clean Parks Citizen Scientist program to engage more users and the public in conserving biodiversity and supporting the establishment of a volunteer system for national parks in hope of striving for a shared vision of blue skies.
In July, NIO received a strategic equity investment from CYVN Holdings, an investment vehicle majorly owned by the Abu Dhabi government. The investment package totaled US$1.1 billion. In addition, we will also cooperate with the new strategic investor to jointly pursue opportunities in our international business.
Although the smart EV market is full of challenges and the competition is increasingly fierce, with our continuous efforts in core technologies, product portfolio, sales capabilities, manufacturing and logistics, we are fully ready to rise to the challenge. We believe that with focused marketing and self-strategy as well as execution, NIO can drive the steady growth of sales and deliveries while further optimizing the cost structure and enhancing operating efficiency on all fronts. We look forward to NIO's strong market performance in the second half.
As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven, who will provide the financial details for the second quarter. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William.
I will now go over our key financial results for the second quarter of 2023. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I will reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Our total revenues in the second quarter were RMB8.8 billion, representing a decrease of 14.8% year-over-year and a decrease of 17.8% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made of two parts: vehicle sales and other sales.
Vehicle sales in the second quarter were RMB7.2 billion, represent a decrease of 24.9% year-over-year and 22.1% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in vehicle sales year-over-year was mainly due to the lower average selling price as a result of higher proportion of ET5 and 75-kilowatt hour standard-range battery pack deliveries and decrease in delivery volume. The decrease in vehicle sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to a decrease in delivery volume.
Other sales in the second quarter were RMB1.6 billion, representing an increase of 119.9% year-over-year and 9.3% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in other sales year-over-year was mainly due to the increase in sales of used cars, accessories and provision of power solutions, as a result of continued growth of our users. The increase in other sales quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the increase in sales of used cars and provision of power solutions, as a result of continued growth of our users, partially offset by decrease in revenue from provision of auto financing services.
Gross margin in second quarter of 2023 was 1.0% compared with 13.0% in the second quarter of 2022 and 1.5% in the first quarter of 2023. Vehicle margins in the second quarter was 6.2% compared with 16.7% in the second quarter of 2022 and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to changes in product mix, partially offset by decreased battery cost per unit. The increase in vehicle margin quarter-over-quarter was many due to decreased promotion discount for the previous generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6.
R&D expenses in the second quarter were RMB3.3 billion, representing an increase of 55.6% year-over-year and increase of 8.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to: first, the increased personnel costs in R&D functions and increased share-based compensation expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2023; and second, the incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies.
SG&A expenses in second quarter were RMB2.9 million, representing an increase of 25.2% year-over-year and increase of 16.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to: first, the increase in personnel costs related to sales functions; second, the increase in sales and marketing activities, including the launch of new products; and third, increased rental and related expenses related to company's sales and service network expansion.
Loss from operation in the second quarter was RMB6.1 billion, representing an increase of 113.5% year-over-year and increase of 18.8% quarter-over-quarter.
Net loss in the second quarter was RMB6.1 billion, representing an increase of 119.6% year-over-year and increase of 27.8% quarter-over-quarter.
Our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investment and long-term time deposits was RMB31.5 billion as of June 30, 2023.
Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Bin Wang of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Thank you. My question is about your sales network structure. Recently, I heard you hired a few of the salesperson from other luxury brands such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi. So, what's the reason you hired non-NIO salesperson recently? And how is the impact so far for your sales volume increase? We also found that in your third quarter guidance, you actually implied in August and September, September will be lower compared to July. So, kind of what's the reason behind it? It's because supply chain issue? Thank you so much. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Well, thank you, Bin Wang. For your first question, actually, around June, we have realized that inside of the company in terms of the number of our salespersons as well as the capabilities of selling products, we are lagged behind by the competitors in the market. For example, for those luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes, the size of their sales team is six to seven times of ours. Without sufficient personnel or touchpoint, we cannot realize a very good user satisfaction, realize very good test drives or high conversion rate from these two orders. So starting from June and -- July and August, we have taken a more active manner in improving our sales capabilities. And with that, we hope that the company will be able to support the new orders of 30,000 units per month that will be contributed by our sales network as well as the personnel increase. So that by the end of September, we will be able to realize that target.
Of course, it takes time for us to really train the personnel and also to find the locations. So, we will have that initial capability ready by the end of September, and then the real effect will kick in from October. That is our existing plan for the improvement. This is also why starting July and August, we've been taking some active measures and actions in expanding our sales network and touchpoints, especially in lower-tier cities where we don't have a full-fledged facilities or stores, we hope to really secure and hire experience and seasoned salespersons who have their networks and user bases already to help us with the sales test.
And regarding your second question, in July, we have delivered more than 20,000 vehicles. And as shown by our guidance, our delivery volume in August and September are lower than that in July. This is mainly because by the end of July, we have announced the adjustment to our power swap user benefits. Before users enjoy or entitled to four or six free swaps per month, but starting from August 1, all the new orders are not entitled to free swaps anymore. This also helped us to pull ahead some orders or users with strong demand for power swap in July, and this has also affected the delivery volume in July.
In terms of the August, we believe that it will take some time for the order momentum and intake to be back to the normal track. But in the meantime, in August, we've also witnessed a new high of the numbers of test drives and leads. Average speaking, during the weekends, we have more than 10,000 test drives. This represents a significant growth from the past month. And in the meantime, we also understand that it will take some time for the test drive to be truly converted into orders and we will wait for that. But overall speaking, we are very confident in stabilizing the order intake as well as the delivery volume. In the meantime, we also need to understand the external challenges, especially the challenges and the pressure from the macroeconomic environment. So, our forecast and guidance have also considered that -- those external factors. But overall speaking, we are confident in the delivery volumes we provided.
Also, we must understand that in July, inside of the premium battery electric vehicle segment, priced over RMB300,000, we have already realized the 59% market share. This has proven a very solid foothold of NIO in this segment, and we will continue to make efforts in transforming and converting ICE users into buying EVs in the premium segment. In this case, we will also make more efforts in expanding our channels at touchpoint.
Thank you, Wang Bin. Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Hsiao of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question, basically, I just want to follow up regarding the sales volumes into second half. Because as William just mentioned, we successfully upgraded our sales team and sales network. So, looking into fourth quarter, I recall that we expect our monthly sales can stay above 20,000. So, if that's the case, look into fourth quarter, should we expect NIO to grow the sales further to above 20,000 or even like 25,000? And what could the contribution from the four volume driving models covering like ET5, ES6? So, could you just provide some update regarding volume?
And my second question is about the gross profit margin. Because according to the management's previous guidance, I think the vehicle gross profit margin could get back to double digit in the second half. So, after the RMB30,000 cost in late June, do you still stick to your previous view on sequential margin expansion into second half? What would be the pace in the quarter and fourth quarter, respectively? That's my second question. Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Tim, for your question. Regarding your first question, of course, we target to realize and stabilize our monthly delivery to be above 20,000 units starting Q4 this year. But in the meantime, we are also preparing our sales capability, so that we can support the new orders of 30,000 units per month. In this case, we are expanding our channels and also personnels. As mentioned, we will be occurring these initial capabilities by the end of September, and we will take some time for the preparation and ramp-up. We believe that the effect of our sales capability improvement will be kicking in from October and November with positive progress from that time point.
In terms of the reference to the NT1 product we've experienced, normally, we realize that it will take around one to two years for the new product to reach a sound and stable volume on a monthly basis. For example, for our first generation ES6, it was launched in 2019, and it was not until 2021 that it has a rather stable and sound monthly delivery. So, we are very confident with our new products.
In terms of the volume products, including ET5, ET5T, ES6 and EC6, these are 4 volume products. For the EC6, it will be delivered starting September and it will take some time for the production and the delivery ramp up. But within its own segment, it will be dominating the major market share. So, with these four models combined, we believe that its monthly volume will be stabilized at around 15,000 to 20,000 units. In terms of higher volume -- higher service products like EC7, ET7 and ES7 as well as ES8, we are expecting also increments on their sales volume.
Yes, Stanley will answer the second question. Yeah. Hi, Tim. Regarding the gross profit margin, as shown in our Q2 financials, the vehicle margin is 6.2%, similar with Q1. The key reasons are sales and production volume at a lower level, driving higher manufacturing costs and other cost allocation and also more promotions to the users and also marketing efforts during the product transition period. But along with our sales and volume ramp-up of our -- all our NT2 product, our target to achieve double-digit gross profit margin in Q3 and 15% in Q4, if we can control the battery cost and other costs well. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] So, we have already digested the impact of the price reduction. Got it. Thank very much, William and Stanley. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Tim. The next question comes from Yuqian Ding of HSBC. Please go ahead. Thanks, team. Yuqian here. I got two. First question is, we practically have all the models are now refreshed and then newly launched based on 2.0 platform model is a pretty comprehensive coverage. We will be expecting strong ramp-up in the coming six months in a visible way. But how do we expect the key growth drivers, if we're looking at 12 to 18 months, especially in terms of new product? How do we fill in the already comprehensive product portfolio or the software is going to be the next leg of growth?
The second question is on the OpEx side. So, this year, we have new model launches and we have the sales channel upgrade. But next year, when we're rolling into next year, could we see the absolute OpEx value dialed down a little bit? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your question. Regarding your first question, as you may know that starting from September, we will launch our EC6 into the market. And with that all its models on the NT2 platforms will be launched to the market. And over the past several months, we have launched five brand new models plus a facelift. In such a short timeframe, we are able to realize the high-quality deliveries of this model. This has also demonstrated our R&D efficiency as well as the strong execution. But in the meantime, we also need to realize that it's a challenge brought by the smart electric vehicles to the entire industry as in a very short timeframe, we needed to catch up to the changes of all the smart technologies.
But in the meantime, for all the NT2 products, we are looking at more software features to be updated and released. For example, our new assisted and intelligent driving. For the coming months, we will be rolling out some new features and also services. This will help us to improve the competitiveness of the product. And also, as we've mentioned, we are developing the sales capabilities inside of the company so that we can reach out to broader channels with more salespersons and support the new orders of 30,000 units per month. This will also be a very concrete foundation for the continuous growth of the sales and deliveries in the coming months.
If you look at our eight models on the NT2 platform, they are already covering 80% of the needs in the premium market. And also, we have also adjusted our organizational structure starting from the third quarter. So that from the headquarters to the regional companies, we will be having dedicated teams managing and responsible for each of the model across the life cycle. This is also the efforts we've made from the sales and marketing perspective. Hi, Yuqian. Regarding the OpEx of next year, the next year budget for us has not been ready. So at this moment, I may not be able to give you the precise number, but I can give you some feeling. Regarding the R&D expense, as introduced in last quarters, on average, each quarter this year, the non-GAAP R&D investments will be RMB3 billion to RMB3.5 billion for this year. I think for next year, the -- we will keep similar like investment R&D activities.
And regarding the SG&A expense, as explained by William, we have a relatively more aggressive sales targets for the second half of this year, I think, should be for next year. So the absolute value for SG&A will grow accordingly since we need more market activities and events. But the percentage of total sales revenue, I think, will decline compared with the first half of this year and also the whole -- I think the whole year of 2023, because of the improvements in both, I think, delivery volume and also operating efficiency. Thank you, Yuqian. The next question comes from Jeff Chung of Citi. Please go ahead. [indiscernible] Hello. I have two questions. First question is our refinancing plan going forward. And the second question is our cash flow projection into the third quarter and fourth quarter. So, why I am asking this is because we saw the first quarter, the net cash outflow was RMB10.6 billion, but improved to a cash outflow of RMB5.9 billion in the second quarter. And within the second quarter, we also saw the inventory Q-on-Q delta of around RMB5 billion, while the account payable -- account receivable remained stable. So that said, if the third quarter inventory came down plus the operating leverage with a volume hike, whether we should see the cash outflow should be significantly narrowing further? This is my first question.
And my second question is about the third quarter and fourth quarter GP margin guidance. When can we return to a 10% or double-digit level as well as the third quarter, fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of the revenue guidance? That's all from me. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Stanley, please answer the first question. Yes, regarding the cash flow, I think -- sorry. Yes, regarding the cash flow and also the refinancing plans, I think several points about this. One is regarding operating cash flow, I think as the delivery volume ramp-up from Q3 this year, our operating cash flow will be significantly improved compared with Q1 and Q2 of this year. And we also carried out a series of measures to control the CapEx investment and also manage our investment cadence prudently like delay or cancel of certain CapEx investments. This will also help us to manage the healthy cash flow. And additionally, as explained in William's comments, we received US$740 million strategic investment from CYVN. And we also completed the offering of our first off-balance sheet ABS in Q3. I think both our U.S. dollar and also RMB financing channels remain [undrafted] (ph). And all those will enable us to keep a healthy cash position and support the ongoing business development of the company.
And regarding the financing -- refinancing plan, we will disclose our plan accordingly if there is any capital market-related updates. But at this moment, I think we don't have the precise information to comment with you. Yes, that's the first question regarding the cash flow and also refinancing plan.
The second is for this year's margin? Yes. For this year's margin, I think we have explained in the previous questions. And for Q3, our target is to achieve the double-digit gross profit margin and Q4 is 15%. And for SG&A guidance, I think the absolute value will grow along with our delivery volume and sales growth, but the percentage of total revenue will decrease. But according to the market situation, the adjustment and the change of our marketing strategy will be quite dynamic. So at this moment, I cannot give you the precise guidance about the percentage of SG&A over sales revenue. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Just a correction here. I mentioned the inventory Q-on-Q delta was RMB5 billion, which was wrong. I just checked that the Q-on-Q data was only RMB2 billion. That's it from my side. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee of Bank of America. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language]
So I have two questions. The first question is, currently, you have eight products to cover the majority of the luxury car segment. So, could you give more guidance on any of the new product plan next year under the NIO brand as well as the ALPS brand?
And the second question is, what is your latest business progress for the mobile business? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your question. For NIO brand, actually, we don't plan to launch any new products in the year of 2024. Of course, we will still roll out some routine facelifts or product upgrades, but we haven't planned any new products for next year, because we think that it's more important for us to stay focused on our existing eight products on the NT2 platform to continuously improve its qualities and also market performance. Just like in 2021, we didn't launch any new models, but still we have realized a very good gross margin, sales volume as well as quality performance. So that's the plan for the brand of NIO.
In terms of our mass market brand, ALPS, we plan to launch the very first model from ALPS in the second half of next year. Right now, the R&D activities are proceeding according to the plan. Actually, we have just rolled out the verification build of the first model from ALPS and this model will be highly competitive in its product segment.
And also for the brands of ALPS, its R&D philosophy is different from that of NIO. ALPS is targeting at the mass market, and we will not have many products in the lineup for ALPS. But for NIO, it's different. It is targeting at the premium segment where we care more about the personalization and also the differentiation of the products. Just like Mercedes and BMW in China, they are selling 40, 50 models. That is a unique character of the premium segment. But for ALPS, for the mass market, it will be more family oriented and we will also care more on the sales volume of each model launched by ALPS.
In terms of our phone business, our mobile phone will be developed mainly for our new users, especially the users of our NT2 products. And the phone itself is developed centering on the vehicles, but with better mobility and connectivity experience. We are actually believing that with the phone business, it can help us to improve the competitiveness of our vehicle products, because our phone business is not to compete with those phone makers. Instead, we would like to use the phone as a carrier to provide the best experience for our vehicle users. Moreover, the underlying software and the underlying logic between the phone and the cars shares quite a lot of similarities. In terms of the launch plan for the phone, we plan to introduce our first phone product in the second half or in late September. The next question comes from Paul Gong of UBS. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. So two questions here. The first question is regarding the sales channel. You mentioned that you are going to expand it. You feel it's behind of the BMW and Mercedes Benz in terms of the channel as well as a sales person. But how does it compare to other EV start-ups? Are we ahead or are we behind? And how much do you think about the expansion of the store network and the sales personnel versus the sales efficiency improvement? And you also mentioned you are going to reach 30,000 monthly sales capability. How does that compare to today? Is that fair to assume? Currently, we have the capability to sell 20,000 monthly sales, given we already achieved that in July and expanding would be about 50% compared to today to 30,000. How does this mathematics work? This is my first question.
The second question is regarding the battery swap versus fast charging given the batteries, the semiconductors as well as even the charging piles, DC charging stations, all these seems to be rolling out with the industrial efforts. How -- I understand it's good to have both the battery swap as well as the fast charging, but would you consider the rolling out of fast charging kind of weak and the battery swap convenience and the competitive edge of NIO's cars? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you for your questions. If you look at the size of the sales teams in comparison to other EV start-ups in China, actually, by the end of June, the size of our sales team is only half of those of other companies. Of course, in terms of the service network, we have specialties and the teams working for the power swap stations, roadside services as well as at the new houses. So for the service and community part, we have a bigger team than other EV start-ups. But when it comes to the actual sales person, in our company, we call them fellows. In terms of the number of fellows, we are -- actually have a much smaller team than all the other companies in the industry.
In April and May this year, our delivery volume was not very high. By then, we didn't really realize the importance of the sales capabilities. We're taking any actions. But starting from June, as we ramp up our delivery volumes, we gradually realize that the insufficient sales teams has affected the satisfaction and also the execution of many things, including test drive and also order conversions. That's why starting from July, we have started to develop our sales channels as well as the sales team. For comparison, to ramp up to the comparable side, we believe that we need around 5,000 people working on the sales team. But of course, it takes time for us to have that many people on the team and also to train them with the corresponding capabilities.
In terms of the delivery volume, in July, we have delivered more than 20,000 cars, but that demonstrated our capability in terms of the deliveries, which is relatively easier than realizing sales capabilities.
And another thing is about the channels. If you look at our sales distribution, [Jiangsu, Fujian] (ph) and Shanghai, these three places basically contribute half of our sales volume. But for other provinces like in Anhui, the capital city itself is contributing around 80% to 90% of the sales volume. If we take Anhui as an example for other brands like BMW or Mercedez, half of their sales volume in Anhui province is contributed by cities outside of Anhui -- sorry, outside of Hefei. And they basically have dealership stores in all the cities in Anhui Province. And for us, we opened -- we've just opened our NIO House in the second largest city in Anhui province that is in Wuhu. In this case, we will need to take efforts in increasing our penetration into the lower-tier cities.
In addition to the sales channels, we are also developing and expanding our power swap networks into more cities. For the past several months, we've been developing our power swap stations in a much faster manner. And in August, we expect that we will deploy and install more than 100 power swap stations. Of course, it will take time for all these measures to kick in, but this investment will be very important for our long-term capability.
Regarding your second question about power swapping versus faster charging, as we've always mentioned, that chargeable, swappable and upgradable have been the philosophy of our power solutions, and we've been choosing the optimal solutions and also the best experience for our users based on the actual scenarios and the use cases. And as we are developing our power swapping network, we are also the automotive brand with the most public chargers in China, as I've mentioned in my opening remarks. Of course, we believe that with the development of the fast charging technology, it will also help us with the power swap operations as it can improve the service capacity of the swap stations. Not to mention that many of the stations we've installed as of today are integrated stations featuring both chargers as well as power swap. So, in terms of the power swapping and the faster charging, we've also had many discussions between these two technologies, but we believe that, so far, power swapping is still having a much better experience than faster charging, and it will continue to be a very unique advantage and the competitiveness of NIO. Thank you very much. That's very helpful. Thank you, William. Thank you, Paul. The next question comes from Jing Chang of CICC. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you for your sharing. I have two following-up questions. The first is about our other sales revenue and profit margin. As we can see that after our policy adjustment, what is our expectation for the future revenue and also profit margin for other sales after our battery swap started to gain profit? And in particular, do we have any internal calculation of the profitability of the battery swapping business? So, what is the upward trend of our gross profit margin for other sales in the following few quarters? And when will it turn positive? This is my first question.
And my second is about the technology improvement. We have always been focused more on R&D investment and also technology accumulation. So, looking forward regarding to our next generation platform, NT3, so what improvement can we expect? What are the major areas of our effort to [proceed] (ph)? So, can you just share a few insights of information about that? This is my two questions. Thank you. Hi, Jing. This is Stanley. Regarding your first question about the other sales, revenue and margin, as we mentioned, we canceled the free battery swap policies in Q3. So therefore, there will be more users to pay for battery swap services. And as the sales keep growing, we think more battery swap service revenue can be realized. But since it's only one month from the policy adjustment, so we still need some time to observe and assess the impact of this policy change.
Second is with the power swap station, the third generation put into operation starting from this April, we will accelerate the deployment of the power swap stations in the following quarters. And for this year, our plan is to build 1,000 stations. But at current stage, the capacity won't be fully utilized. So, the losses from the accelerated construction of power swap station will increase. So, I think that's basically the guidance for the other sales revenue. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Actually, the inherent efficiency of the power swap business is pretty high. Before we have negative margin on this part, it's mainly because when we were offering free power swaps, the electricity costs were also included in that offering. But now we are charging that separately. In addition, we are also charging our users RMB30 per swap as a service fee. Actually, we are seeing growing demand for such charged power swap services. Especially many used car users, they are actually using the service. So, the percentage for the users to use the paid swap service is also growing. It's mainly a business for the existing users and existing population.
For the third-generation power swap stations, we've also done a rough calculation. When it completes 60 swaps per day, it basically can be breaking even, and its service revenues will be covering its operating costs. Right now, around 20% of our third-generation stations are able to realize such performance and capability. So, for the long run, we believe that power swap is also a sustainable business. As in addition to offering power swap services, we also have other diversified business models like we can leverage the energy storage.
Regarding your second question about our next-generation technology, of course, we will be leveraging our full stack capabilities developed in-house. With that, we will continue to improve the experience and also the performance of our products. And we believe that this will give us a strong product competitiveness worldwide. And also the continuous investment into the research and the development of the core technologies will also help us to optimize and improve the vehicle margin as well as improving the efficiencies of our operations and R&D.
Thank you, Jing. Okay, thank you. That's all my question. Thank you. The next question comes from Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, thank you. I have one question. I'm wondering what is the management team's openness to embarking on some more strategic action? We've obviously seen a lot of activity from the European OEMs in China trying to revive or restructure their efforts. And I also think in the context of -- I think NIO has made some mistakes. We talked a lot about sales, the sales force today, we had a lot of supply issues last year, many of which are related actually to more traditional auto side. Can we perhaps benefit actually from having some more closer strategic relationships with some of the OEMs out there? Thank you. [Foreign Language]
[Interpreted] Thank you, Edison, for your question. Overall speaking, we are very open to all kinds of cooperations with peers in the industry. But so far, we don't have much information to update or share with you. But if you look at our smart technologies as well as our charging and swapping networks, actually, we aim to use these technologies to catalyze the transformation of the entire industry. As we've also announced at the Power Day 2023, we are willing to open up our next-generation battery technologies as well as our charging and swapping networks to the entire industry. Right now, we are in some initial communications with certain OEMs. They are also thinking about using our battery technologies for swapping networks. But to use that technologies, they need to adapt their products to our standards, which can take some time for them to make the final decisions. But overall speaking, we are very open to all kinds of cooperation.
And in terms of our existing charging network, so far, 80% of our electricity are actually charged for the non-NIO users. Maybe you've also read this news recently in Xinjiang, Sayram Lake because it's such a popular tourist spot, we have to limit access to our public chargers for the non-NIO users at certain timeframes, and that caused some complaints by the non-NIO users. But overall speaking, it's also a very good example of showing our existing charging and swapping facilities are helping many EV users, not just the user from NIO. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Edison. As there are no questions now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for any closing remarks. Thank you once again for joining us today.

William, please go ahead. [Interpreted] Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2023 Q3 earnings call.In the third quarter of 2023, by making the most of a complete product line-up on the NT2.0 platform, the improvement of overall sales capacity and capability, as well as the continuous expansion of sales, service, and power networks. NIO delivered a total of 55,432 premium smart electric vehicles, up 75.4% year-over-year. The retail stats from Carpark showed that in Q3, NIO ranked first in China's BEV segment with an average transaction price of over RMB 300,000, with market share above 45% in the segment.In September, NIO launched and delivered the all-new EC6, a mid-size coupe SUV upgraded to the second generation. It also marked the completion of NIO's product line-up on the NT2.0 Platform. In Q4, as price war deepens and competition gets tighter for smart EVs, NIO delivered a total of 32,033 vehicles in October and November, up 32.2% from last year while maintaining our prices stable. In Q4, the total deliveries are expected to be between 47,000 to 49,000.Going forward, we will stay focused on executing sales strategies and improving operational efficiency. We believe the competitiveness of NIO's second-generation products will be further unleashed next year.In terms of NIO's financial performance, attributed to the increased sales mix for higher-priced models, decreased parts costs, and improved economies of scale enabled by more deliveries, combined with the refined management of sales policies, the vehicle margin in the third quarter reached 11%.Next, I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D, and operations. On September 21, NIO held NIO IN, NIO's Innovation and Technology Day. At the event, NIO's 12 full-stack technology capabilities covering the holistic business scenarios for smart EVs from multiple brands and platforms were introduced to the public for the first time.In the meantime, NIO also unveiled China's first vehicle operating system, SkyOS, and the in-house developed LiDAR SoC named Yang Jian, demonstrating NIO's systematic R&D capabilities leading the industry.Regarding assisted and intelligent driving, NIO has been quickly iterating the system capabilities. On November 15th, Power Swap Pilot for Highway Beta was released in China. So far, 29 Power Swap stations on highways already support this feature. PSP seamlessly combines NOP+ and Power Swap, bringing new users a hassle-free highway driving and battery swapping experience that is automated and intelligent from end-to-end.In the meantime, NIO has rolled out the NOP+ for urban traffic, providing users with uninterrupted driving experience from point A to point B, both on highways and on city streets. Enabled by NIO's generalization capability in-house and taking into consideration the high demand roads on users' wishes, we've started to roll out NOP+ for cities, route-by-route, from November, and we'll gradually realize wider coverage.At present, the NOP+ been released to early bird users in several major cities and is quickly becoming available for more routes and in more cities, which has far surpassed the target announced at NIO IN. At our upcoming NIO Day communication event, we will be sharing more information about that.In terms of the sales and service network, so far we have 468 new house, new space, and pop-up stores in 152 cities, as well as 314 service centers and 62 delivery centers in 217 cities.As for the charging and swapping network, to date, we have installed 2,226 Power Swap stations, over 9,400 power chargers and over 11,000 destination chargers worldwide. More than 1.46 million public chargers have been connected with NIO's charging maps.NIO's long-tested and well-proven battery swapping system has offered over 32 million convenient, efficient, and safe battery swaps to NIO users, making Power Swap the most trusted recharging solution for them. NIO Power Cloud and NIO's Power Swap network have been opened to the entire industry.In November, NIO partnered with Changan Automobile and Geely Holding respectively on battery swapping. In the future, NIO will join hands with more industry partners in such areas as formulation of swappable battery standards, battery swap network, R&D of battery swapping vehicles, and the management of battery assets. So as to provide the holistic, chargeable, swappable, and upgradeable solution to more smart EV users, and jointly contribute to the development and wider adoption of battery swap.NIO Day, NIO's grand annual gatherings with users will be held on December 23rd in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. This year, we will unveil a brand new flagship model, a real epitome of NIO's innovative technologies. This product will become a technology benchmark for smart EVs and a trendsetter of the smart EV technologies worldwide.On September 26, with contributions to shaping a low-carbon industry with innovative EV battery swapping, NIO received the Green Innovation Award of the 2023 Paulson Prize for Sustainability. This award is a recognition of the novelty and expandabilities, as well as the economic and environmental benefits of NIO's battery swapping technology and business model.The 2023 NIO Cup Formula Student China, a racing car design competition for college students was held from November 8 to November 12 in Hefei. NIO has been sponsoring and supporting the competition since 2015. So far, Formula Student China has cultivated more than 40,000 young professionals for China's automotive industry, becoming one of the most important cradles of young automotive talent in China.The next 2 years, we'll see the most intense competition during the transformation of the automotive industry. Faced with massive uncertainty in the external environment, recently we've sorted through and adjusted our key objectives, priorities, and action plans to become more focused on efficient execution and improvement of system capabilities. While ensuring long-term investment in core technologies, strong sales and service capabilities to navigate the intense market competition, and on-time release of the 9 core products from the 3 brands.We will continuously optimize internal working processes and the division of roles and responsibilities, stay focused on projects that can contribute to the company's financial performance, and comprehensively improve organizational efficiency and resource utilization. We are very confident of NIO's long-term competitiveness in the smart EV industry.As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven to provide the financial details for the third quarter. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the third quarter of 2023. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I will reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our audience press release, which is posted online for additional details.Our total revenues in the third quarter were RMB 19.1 billion, representing an increase of 46.6% year-over-year and an increase of 117.4% quarter-over-quarter. Our total revenues are made up of 2 parts, vehicle sales and other sales. Vehicle sales in the third quarter were RMB 17.4 billion, representing an increase of 45.9% year-over-year and 142.3% quarter-of-quarter. The increase in vehicle sales year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributable to higher vehicle deliveries. Other sales in the third quarter were RMB 1.7 billion, representing an increase of 55% year-over-year, an increase of 4.5% quarter-over-quarter.Gross margin in the third quarter of 2023 was 8%, compared with 13.3% in the third quarter of 2022, and 1% in the second quarter of 2023. The changes of gross margin year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, was mainly attributable to the changes of vehicle margin. More specifically, vehicle margin in the third quarter was 11%, compared with 16.4% in the third quarter of 2022, and 6.2% in the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributable to changes in product mix, partially offset by the decreased battery cost per unit. The increase in vehicle margin of quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to changes in product mix, as well as decreased promotion.Around expenses in third quarter were RMB 3 billion represents an increase of 3.2% year-over-year and a decrease of 9.1% quarter-over-quarter. The slight increase in research and development expenses year-over-year was mainly attributable to increased personal costs in research and development functions partially offset by the decreased design and development costs and deduction of expenses due to support for technology advancement provided by local government authorities during the third quarter of 2023.The decrease in research and development expenses quarter-over-quarter was mainly due to the support for technology advancement provided by local government authorities during the third quarter of 2003. As general expenses in the third quarter were RMB 3.6 billion, representing an increase of 33.1% year-over-year, an increase of 6.3% quarter-over-quarter.Plus, for operations in the third quarter was RMB 4.8 billion representing an increase of 25.2% year-over-year, and a decrease of 23% quarter-over-quarter. Last, in the third quarter was RMB 4.6 billion representing an increase of 10.8% year-over-year, and a decrease of 24.8% quarter-over-quarter. Our balance for cash and cash equivalents, restrict cash, short-term investment, and long-term time deposits was RMB 45.2 billion as of September 30, 2023.Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Hsiao with Morgan Stanley. I actually have 2 parts of the questions. The first one is about battery swapping, because the new, as just mentioned, pretty expanded strategic alliance in battery swapping from previous partner like Sinopec to Changan and the Geely. Could you share a little bit more about your plans of how to structure the new alliance of battery swapping and the potential financial impact like your CapEx and operating loss?So in the long term, will you consider to spin off the battery swapping business and operate it independently or even go public as a standalone third-party battery swapping or utility operator? So that's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you, Tim, for your question. Yes, recently we have announced the cooperation agreements with both Changan and Geely on the battery swapping. And in terms of the battery swap network, the way we look at it is a bit similar to the cloud service or the cloud infrastructure. Both Power Swap Stations and the Cloud Infrastructure require and rely on the network effect. Both can have a pretty long investment cycle. And both are actually started with the internal services first. And after sufficient validations and verifying the demands and the fulfillment for our users' needs, we will then open up the service to the public.So after 5-years of validation and internal services, we believe that we are ready to provide such network and service to the industry. And it's about time to open up the network to the industry.And as we all know that, there are quite a lot of benefits with Power Swap. It is faster than charging, and also it has better user experience. It also brings values and benefits to users and also the society. Especially in China, many users living in the urban environment or compound and apartments do not have a home charger. In fact, actually more than 50% of our users cannot install a charger at home. In this case, battery swap becomes even more important and convenient for those users who do not have home chargers.This is also very important for the mass market brand, because NIO is after all a premium brand, and many of our users can still have chargers at home. But for the mass market brand, the percentage of not being able to have the home chargers will be higher. That's why when we started to share our battery design standards and also specifications for the mass market brand to the industry peers, many of them are very interested in this alliance. We have already announced 2 agreements, and there are several more that are still in negotiation. As we also believe that with NIO's current battery swap technologies, service standards, and also service network, this is what they need for their product as well as for their users.And Also, in terms of the business model for the Power Swap, we believe that it is sustainable both from the business perspective as well as from the finance perspective. Especially after 5-years of operations and validation, we have confidence in the sustainability of battery swap.In terms of our battery swap network, as we will continue to expand our Power Swap network, there will be CapEx also relevant to such network development. In the meantime, we are also looking for approaches where we may introduce partners into our Power Swap network. Basically, they will buy the battery swap station as a product from us, and then they will install the stations and hand it over to us for the operations. In this case, they will be holding this battery asset for us. There are a thousand of -- stations already running based on this business model. For the longer term, we will also be looking for partners holding the battery swap station assets.In terms of the NIO powers charging service, it is already almost breaking even. As you may know, 80% of our power was charged for the non-new users. For the longer term, new power charging will also be a profitable business. Actually, in certain areas and with charging stations -- with certain swap stations, the operation is already profitable. This is also -- in terms of spinning of the Power Swap stations, there are some investors showing their interest in having Power Swap or Power Swap business as a independent business. We are also in conversation with them. Yes. Okay. Tim, your next question. Sure. Thank you, Will for sharing all the details. So my next question is about the car manufacturing. Because -- as you just mentioned, NIO announced to acquire the production facility from JAC. So, first, does that mean NIO has been granted the manufacturing license? In the meantime, I think that means NIO officially shifted from the asset-light business model to asset-happy. So, in the near-term, how should we think about the unique cost of vehicle manufacturing from fourth quarter onward? I think previously, we provided vehicle margin guidance 50% for December quarter. In the long term, do you still think that the full stack in-house development, production, and direct vehicle sales without relying on dealers would be the most ideal model for both NIO and ALPS, the mass market brand, or if there will be any major difference? That's my second question. Stephen will answer this question. Okay. I'll give an example of your question about the manufacturing, car manufacturing. During this acquisition, the manufacturing agreements between NIO and JAC are still performed, are stipulated, and the production activities of the models in the corporation are going on normally.Going forward, if there is any change to the manufacturing corporation with regards to the REDD models between NIO and JAC or other situations that constitute significant information after this acquisition or in the future, NIO will communicate with and disclose the capital market in a timely manner, comply with the REDD norms and regulations and the rules for listed companies. [Interpreted] And also, to add on to Stephen's comment, if we bring the entire manufacturing fully in-house, overall speaking, our manufacturing cost will be reduced by around 10%. Our next question comes from Nick Lai with JP Morgan. [Foreign Language] My first simple question is really about NIO's plan to increase or enhance operation efficiency and re-archive our resource to more important priorities. So if you can give us some examples and a little bit -- a bit more on this initiative. [Interpreted] In this round of organizational optimizations, we have identified several principles. Because over the years of development, we have some low-efficiency positions and jobs, and also some duplicated roles and responsibilities. In this case, we have identified these low-efficiencies or redundancies in the organization. We have improved the processes of lower-efficiencies, and we have also eliminated jobs and positions that are duplicated or are of low-efficiencies. And also, in terms of the projects deferred or terminated, basically we look at the projects and their financial contribution.If they cannot bring any financial contribution in the coming 3 years, we will be thinking about deferring them or terminating them. For example, if they cannot contribute to the gross margin or the P&L, they may need to be deferred or reconsidered. A quick example is regarding the in-house manufacturing of our batteries. We've identified that in the coming 3 years, bringing battery production in-house will not help us with the gross margin improvement. In this case, we have decided to defer the plan. We will still continue to do the in-house R&D of battery cells, battery materials, and the battery packs. But we will outsource the manufacturing of the battery packs for better overall efficiency and performance.So for this round of optimization, we've done a detailed and thorough review and adjustments and also made the necessary adjustments based on the needs of the business and the resources of the entire company.But in the meantime, we will still make sure that we don't miss our focus or dilute our investment resources for the high priority items for the coming 2 years. The first is the long-term investment for the core technologies so that we can still keep leading in terms of the products and the technologies. As I mentioned earlier today, at the NIO Day 2023, we are going to unveil a brand new flagship model. And this car will be equipped with a lot of state-of-the-art technologies that are leading the entire automotive industry.And our second priority is the continuous development of our sales and service networks. Recently, we have enlarged the sales teams. We have also increased the number of the point of sales so that we can get ready for the more intense competition in the coming 2 years. Because if we don't make such preparation, we will not be navigating the intense competition. An example is that in October in Shanghai, our sales volume has outnumbered that of BMW and Mercedes running on all power sources, including ICE cars as well as EVs.And in cities from Jiangsu or Zhejiang provinces, we are also establishing a pretty solid foothold with a pretty significant market share. But when it comes to lower tier cities like fourth tier or fifth tier cities, we still have a long way to go. Or in cities where the EV infrastructure is not yet ready, we are also not outperforming those well-established brands. In this case, we need to continue to develop our sales and service networks.In terms of our sales performance in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shanghai, actually 50% of our sales volume is contributed by the sales in these 3 areas. On the one hand, it shows that our products are well-recognized in the highly competitive markets in these 3 places.On the other hand, it also means that we need to further enhance our brand awareness in the lower tier cities. And the third priority in the coming 2 years is to secure the on-time release of our 9 core products from the third brands. We have already made investments, and the products of this third brand will be coming into the market very quickly in the coming 2 years. [Foreign Language] My second question is really about the balance or the choice between sales volume and margin, and how should we consider these 2 factors when it comes to the market competition? and are we still maintaining 50% of vehicle GP margin in 4Q and a long-term target of, let's say, 20% to 22% of vehicle GP margin, sometimes toward '24 or beyond? [Interpreted] Our strategy for the third quarter is pretty clear. That is to keep our prices stable. Earlier this year in June, we have adjusted our user benefits. Actually, both our existing users and the new users were accepting this adjustment pretty well. So we may be the only company able to satisfy both existing users and the new users with a benefit adjustment.And since then, we have been keeping a pretty stable price strategy as we believe that it is beneficial to our brand image and also product competitiveness. And also users' experience and benefits. As going into Q4, the price war deepens. The competition also gets more fierce. For many well-established brands like our competitors BMW and Mercedes, they are also slashing prices pretty aggressively. Even on their EV models, the price reduction can be as high as 31%. But we still keep a pretty stable price amid this fierce competition. This is also reflected. This stable price is also reflected in our improved vehicle margin. So our longer-term strategy will be keeping our price stable while continuously improving our vehicle margin.In the meantime, we will also improve our sales capacity, capability, and efficiency so that we can bolster our sales volume. But this can take time and we will be staying patient. We will not realize or boost our sales volume at the cost of our product margin as this is not healthy for the longer run.Maybe Stanley can also add more information regarding the specific financial numbers. Nick, our vehicle gross profit margin is 11% for Q3 and we are confident to achieve a higher margin in Q4 considering more production efficiency, lower price of lithium carbonate, and also decreased part cost. Our target is also still kept at 15% for Q4. And from long run, as an important project internally, we have started to further improve our cost structure for NT2.0 products by optimizing design, improving supply chain and production efficiency, and also business negotiation with our partners.As mentioned by William, our NIO brand keeps focus on premium market segment and we will keep product prices relatively stable. So combining all those factors together, we believe our vehicle margin can be further increased to 15% to 18% in 2024. That's the general guidance for vehicle margin. [Interpreted] And also looking at our previous vehicle margin history, before the crisis of the lithium carbonate spike, we actually managed to realize a vehicle margin as good as 21%. So for a much longer term, we will also target -- a target that we like -- vehicle margin of above 20%. Our next question comes from Yuqian Ding with HSBC. This is Yuqian Ding here. I got 2 questions. Maybe we roll it one-by-one. The first one is on the cash position. We noticed the cash balance increasing quarter-on-quarter. Other than the strategic investment and the convertible bond, there is also still a RMB 1 billion increase. Does that coming from the improving operation? Can you shed out a little bit more light on that? Yuqian, this is Stanley. In fact, the new product delivery ramp-up in Q3, we achieved a positive operating cash flow. Yes. Going forward, if our sales can continue to grow, we are confident to realize a healthy operating cash flow. So that's for your first question. Yes. Okay Got it. The second question is on the OpEx reduction. Thanks for William sharing on optimizing the battery business. We also read there is also a headcount cut. Could you share more on whether there will be asset write-offs during the process of the cost optimization, and when we would expect us to reach a lean yet sustainable shape? Yes. Yuqian, about the cost optimization, yes, we reduced 10% working positions and completed the adjustment in November. But for Q4, there will be almost no financial impact since we need to pay additional compensation for the employees who left the company, offset with less payroll costs. But for next year, together with the headcount reductions, we also delayed or cancelled a certain project, as mentioned by William. So the total impact to 2024 will be a saving of RMB 2 billion. [Interpreted] Yes, this round of optimization has helped us to improve the financial performance slightly over our previous budget. However, we do need to have some one-time expenses due to the severance package for the terminated employees. Our next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee with Bank of America. My first question is regarding your second brand, ALPS in 2024. In the future, will you consider to share the charging station and the battery swap station along with the NIO brand? And also, will you also consider to share the sales channel with NIO brand? [Interpreted] Yes, when it comes to our mass market brand code named ALPS. Actually, recently we have just had the very first validation build of this brand. A road of the production line, actually, the condition of this verification build is pretty good. It can be maybe one of the best EV cars we have in the history of NIO. So we are very confident in the competitiveness of this project. And before the official launch and delivery, we still have time to continue to optimize and improve the project.In terms of our Power Swap and the charging network strategy, for NIO, our battery swap network will be coming in 2 parts. The first is the exclusive network for NIO and NIO users. And the second will be a shared network, not only for NIO users, but also for ALPS users and other brands with swappable vehicles.In terms of the charging network, we have been sharing our chargers already to many non-NIO brands. In terms of the sales network, this will be separated. So they will have their own sales stores. But we will be sharing the service capacities and facilities. So service centers will be shared between NIO and ALPS. So my second question is regarding your 2024 product. Because this year you already updated all of your new models and also launched some new models. So in 2024, will you have some facelift version of the existing model and start to use 800-voltage charging system on your car? So in this case, do you have any guidance about the battery swap station you will expect? [Interpreted] Yes, it's a common standard and practices for the automotive industry to have model years or facelifts. But for our NT2.0 products, we will not have any major modifications or upgrades. As many of them were just newly launched or delivered to the market. To stabilize our quality and supply chain, we will only make minor improvements and upgrades on our NT2.0 products.In terms of our plan for the Power Swap stations in 2024, as I've mentioned, we will be not only building our exclusive battery swap network, but also a battery swap network for sharing. On the one hand, we will build this Power Swap network for other brands that can be shared with other brands.In the meantime, we will also continue to look at the demand of our NIO users. So that, if there are any requirements or high demand stations or locations, we will also install stations there. But we are still working on the specific plans and the numbers. Our next question comes from Paul Gong with UBS. My first question is regarding your sales force, sales team. I think in last quarter's earnings, you mentioned that you are going to significantly increase your sales people's headcount. May I double check how this has been proceeding at this moment? Have you achieved your original target of expanding sales team, or have you adjusted your original plan? [Interpreted] Paul, at the present, for our frontline fellows, we have a team of around 5,700 persons, but many of them were just newly on board. Around 3,300 of them were newly on board into the company, and it still takes some time for them to really get to know the brand and also get familiar with the entire sales processes. Because for the newly hired fellows, we will spend around 1.5 months on the trainings, and afterwards we can start to sell vehicles to our users.According to our history data, a seasoned fellow on average will need to spend around 6 months to be familiar with the brand and the processes, and will become a real sales force for the company. So we need to be patient with this newly hired fellows, as many of them just joined the company in September and October. But in the meantime, we will also be completing and improving our assessment and evaluation systems, our training systems. We will also bring these fellows more efficient tools so that they can really make full use of their sales capacity and capability. My second question is regarding the R&D spending. I think this quarter you had about RMB 300 million, quarter-over-quarter decline on the R&D, and the explanation is some incentives from the local government. May I quantify that number? And more importantly, going forward, what would be your projected quarterly R&D spending? Yes, Stanley, you answer that question. Yes. Paul, there are some slight decreases considering some support we received from the local authorities. But in the long run, as we mentioned during the past earnings quarter, our non-GAAP R&D investment per quarter will also be kept at RMB 3 billion to RMB 3.5 billion. As also mentioned by William in previous statements, we will also ensure investment in core technologies and also the advantages of technology and product and guarantee the timely launch of the new product. So the investment in R&D will not decrease. There will be a slight fluctuation across different quarters. The next question comes from Jing Chang with CICC. Please go ahead. [Foreign Language] So my first question is regarding to autonomous driving. We have already opened the submission of wish list in September. So relying on group intelligence, we try to expand the NOA function in unmapped cities, which is a little bit different from other OEMs. They open up city-by-city. So the group introduced our ideas on the implementation of NOA function in the city area. And also, what's our, again, our target of the cumulative mileage of 6,000 kilometers by the end of last year. So how is our current progress? [Interpreted] In terms of news NLP Plus for cities, actually we leverage our generalization capabilities as well as the crossing AI capabilities so that we can roll out this NLP route-by-route for our users based on their demand. Of course, in the meantime, we have also formulated the data closed loop capabilities where we can really leverage all this data coming from the generalization and also cloud AI.At the NIO end, we have announced that by the end of this year, we are going to open up the routes covering around 60,000 kilometers of mileage. And so far, our progress is pretty good, and we already have established the capabilities of releasing NLP Plus for early bird users in more than 100 cities. And we will be rolling out such a service and invite our users into the program step-by-step so that it can be covering more cities with more users gradually.Of course, in terms of city-based or road-based autonomous driving or NLP, we do see some of our peers, they have some marketing slogans regarding their services, but we believe that NLP Plus, especially NLP Plus for cities, is a pretty serious service, and we would like to make sure that our users have a safe and also good experience.And then we will roll out the service and its coverage step-by-step. But overall speaking, our progress has far surpassed our expectations. And after all, we already have more than 100,000 vehicles running on the road. This will also help us to further formulate and improve our data cultureEspecially for every new NT2.0 vehicle, it is standard with 4 Orin chips and also 33 high-performance sensors. This will further help us to formulate the data closed loop and improve the data capabilities. And in return, we will also accelerate the capabilities for iteration. This is also a very unique advantage of NIO, which is quite different from any other competitors offering a similar service.So my second question is regarding to the overseas market, will it still be one of our strategic focus? Could you please introduce the current operation situation of our overseas market this year regarding to our sales volume, our layout program of our co-regions, and also about the dealerships and the infrastructure, and also our next year's target and plan? [Foreign Language] So my second question is regarding to overseas markets. Will it still be one of our strategic focus? Could you please introduce the current operation situation of our overseas market this year regarding to the -- our sales volume, our layout program of our co-regions, and also about the dealerships and the infrastructure? And also our next year's target and plan? [Interpreted] At the moment, in 5 European countries, we have opened 6 NIO houses, 8 NIO spaces, 2 multi-functional service centers, and also partnered with 54 authorized service centers. We have also installed 30 Power Swap stations in 5 European countries.But in terms of our business development in Europe, we are still at the early stage of the business development and expansion. We want to continue to test the water, ensure we have good user experience before we scale our operations and business there. That's why volume is not a priority for us in terms of our European business. And in the coming 1-year, we will continue to be staying at this stage. We will make sure that our capability and capacity are sufficient to serve our users in Europe before we start to work on a higher scale. Our next question comes from Jason Getz with Mizuho Securities USA. You talked a couple of months back about 20,000 vehicles a month in December. We're running a little bit below that now. What have been the biggest headwinds there? Has it been some production challenges, maybe broader macro weakness? And then what did it take to get to that 20,000 units? And how should we think about the run rate moving through 2024 with the new sales force? [Interpreted] Thank you for your questions. As we mentioned earlier today, in the premium battery electric vehicle segment priced over RMB 300,000, NIO has realized a 45% market share in the third quarter of this year. Actually, our market share in this segment has been pretty stable, around 40%. So this has proven that we have a relatively solid foothold in the premium BEV segment. We have a pretty significant, also stable market share already established in the segment. But when it comes to convincing users of premium ICE cars of buying a premium EV, it is actually more difficult than convincing mass market users. Because for the mass market users buying a car of RMB 100,000 or RMB 200,000, they pay attention to the ownership cost and also the usage cost of the product. But for the users of premium electric vehicles, they pay more attention to other factors.And the second reason that may be affecting the wider adoption of the premium BEV is regarding the coverage of infrastructure. As I've also shared in the Yangtze River Delta areas, mainly Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, we have a pretty significant market share. Our sales volume has outnumbered that of BMW, Audi, and Mercedes with their ICE car sales. A very important reason behind this is because we have 700 Power Swap stations already established in this area.So infrastructure is also playing a very important role in boosting the sales volume and the adoption of electric vehicles. So far in China, we have already installed over 2,000 Power Swap stations, but roughly 700 of them are along the highways. In some regions and areas, our Power Swap stations are still not widely accessible. In this case, we will need to also speed up and enhance our infrastructure coverage so that we can further boost the wider adoption of electric vehicles.So basically, 2 main reasons. The first is regarding the consumption habits of the premium vehicle users, and the second is mainly because of the coverage of the infrastructures for electric vehicles. But we believe that this trend of convincing ICE users of buying EVs or this overall trend of transforming into battery electric vehicles will be picking up its speed because we also find that some of our peers and competitors before they only have hybrid vehicles or range-extended vehicles, but now they're also launching their battery electric vehicles.Such strategy will also push the transformation of the entire industry, so we are actually happy to see such transformation. And also, many car companies are now also installing and expanding their charging network, and NIO is working on our battery swap network. With wider infrastructure, we will also boost the adoption of the battery electric vehicles.So overall speaking, we believe that 2024 will be better off than in 2023 because in 2024, we will also be having a more stable product portfolio without frequent product launch and delivery which has also slightly disturbed our overall execution. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. On the battery swap partnership side, is there any kind of design changes that your partners would have to do to their vehicles in order for them to use the swap stations? And if so, have you guys talked about what percent of mix of vehicles they produce might need to be kind of changed or edited in the production process in order to do battery swapping? [Interpreted] Actually, we have shared the battery spikes and also the design details of our battery packs for the mass market brand to our battery swap partners. And they will need to design and engineer their vehicle products, mainly chassis interfaces, following our battery standards. It will take some time for them to decide on the right models and complete the product R&D. But the overall investment and R&D expenses for developing such new models based on our battery standards won't be very high. If there are no further questions, now I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes today's conference call.

William, please go ahead. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2023 Q4 and full year earnings call. In Q4 of 2023, NIO delivered a total of 50,045 premium smart EVs, up 25% year-over-year. In 2023, NIO's cumulative delivery reached 160,038 units, representing a growth of 30.7% from 2022. In January and February of 2024, due to the seasonality of our industry and the Chinese New Year, NIO delivered 18,187 vehicles. On March 7, NIO will start to deliver the 2024 models, featuring enhanced performance and experience.With that, NIO's sales will gradually bounce back and the total deliveries in Q1 is expected to be between 31,000 to 33,000 units. In terms of NIO's financial performance, with continuous improvements on the [ bond ] cost, the vehicle gross margin increased to 11.9% in Q4.Now, I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations. On December 23, NIO Day 2023 was held in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, where the smart electric executive flagship, NIO ET9 was unveiled. ET9 embodies NIO's full-stack capabilities and the global leading technologies, featuring core technologies such as in-house developed AD chip, NX9031; full-domain 900 volt architecture; SkyRide chassis system; and the flagship safety and security. ET9 defines the technology standard for the next-generation premium smart EVs. The delivery will start in Q1 2025.In the meantime, NIO will soon start to deliver its 2024 models with the configuration and the performance upgrades, including the brand new Central Computing Cluster, Adam, which brings the computing power to a new level. Enabled by the industry's highest computing power, NIO's software release has become faster, making our products more competitive.With respect to NIO Assisted and Intelligent Driving or NAD, NIO's collective intelligence capability has seen better growth, with the total validated urban mileage increasing a 100 volt in 5 months. As of the end of January, Navigate on Pilot Plus were validated and made available more than 1 million kilometers of roads in China, including 650,000 kilometers of complicated urban driving scenarios in 606 cities.In Q2, the NOP+ for urban roads is expected to be released to all NT2 users, which will make this OTA update the largest public release of its kind in China. Through computing sharing across different domains on the Central Computing Cluster, NOMI GPT, a multi-modal large vision model will be released soon, making the cockpit smarter and more secure. In addition, NIO's mass market brand will make its debut in Q2. The first product will be launched in Q3 with the mass deliveries to start in Q4.As for the sales and service network, so far, NIO has 148 NIO Houses and 352 NIO Spaces, as well as 314 service centers and 62 delivery centers.. About the charging and swapping networks, to-date NIO have 2,419 power swap stations worldwide, providing over 39.5 million swaps cumulatively. It also has installed over 10,000 power chargers and 11,600 destination chargers.During the Chinese New Year, on the previous date, NIO completed 19,199 swaps, [indiscernible] stations on highway provides to 195 swaps. Battery swap has become the most reliable solution for NIO users. Following the battery swap cooperation with Changan and Geely, another 2 strategic cooperation agreement was signed with JAC and Chery in January. NIO will rollout comprehensive and in-depth cooperation on battery swap with these partners.Moreover, NIO has partnered with multiple energy companies, such as Anhui Energy Group and the China Southern Power Grid to jointly build swap stations. The value of our battery swap has been appreciated by more people, making a holistic chargeable, swappable and upgradable solution, a well-recognized the core advantage of NIO. In 2024, NIO plans to build 1,000 new battery swap stations and 20,000 chargers, bringing the total to over 3,310 swap stations and 41,000 chargers by the end of 2024.Regarding the capital market, in December, NIO received USD 2.2 billion strategic investment from an Abu Dhabi investor CYVN Holdings. The investment has further strengthened NIO's balance sheet, laying a solid foundation for NIO's investment into the next-generation core technologies and products.Shouldering the corporate social responsibility and supporting global sustainable development, NIO always have stayed true to its foundation vision of Blue Sky Coming. In general, NIO was selected by Corporate Knights into the 2024 Global 100 Most Sustainable Companies, making to the list for the second time in a row. NIO was placed 15th among more than 6,000 companies worldwide, up 29 spots from last year.As the competition intensified in 2024, we see both challenges and opportunities with faster deployment of charging and swapping facilities, and the change in consumer behavior, the premium BEV segment to which NIO brand belongs will soon arrive at an inflection point of growth.In the second half, a new brand for the mass market will also become our growth lever. In 2024, we will continue to focus on the corporate top priority; level-up system capabilities, strengthen [ cost mindset ] and the cost to management so as to bring our A game to the next phase of the competition.As always, thank you for your support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven for Q4's financial details. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. And to be mindful of the length of this call, I will reference to RMB only in my discussion today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.Let me start with revenue. For the fourth quarter of 2023, total revenues reached RMB 17.1 billion, up 6.5% year-over-year and down 10.3% quarter-over-quarter. 90% of revenue comes from vehicle sales in Q4, which was RMB 15.4 billion, representing an increase of 4.6% year-over-year and a decrease of 11.3% quarter-over-quarter. The improvement year-over-year was driven by growing delivery volume, despite the impact of lower average selling price, resulted from product mix changes. The decrease quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to a decrease of 9.3% in delivery volume.Moving to other sales. Other sales reached RMB 1.7 billion, growing 27.6% year-over-year and 0.4% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased sales in accessories and the provision of power solutions, which both grew with our user base.Then, let's have a look at the gross margin. Overall gross margin was 7.5% compared with 3.9% in the same period of last year and 8.0% in the last quarter. The increase year-over-year was mainly attributed to the increased vehicle margin. The slight decrease quarter-over-quarter was due to the decrease in margin from provision of power solutions as a result of expanded power network, even though vehicle margin was growing.A closer look at vehicle margin, which was up to 11.9% in this quarter compared with 6.8% in Q4 2022 and 11.0% in Q3 2023. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the decreased material cost per unit in Q4 2023 and lower base in Q4 2022, which resulted from the inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the previous generation of ES8, ES6 and EC6 recorded.Let me move on to the operating expenses. R&D expenses were RMB 4.0 billion, remained stable year-over-year and increased 30.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was mainly driven by incremental design and development costs for new products and technologies and higher personnel costs in R&D functions. SG&A expenses were RMB 4.0 billion; increased 12.6% year-over-year and 10.1% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly related to higher personnel costs in sales functions and increased sales and marketing activities.Let's move further to the bottom line. Loss from operations was RMB 6.6 billion, representing a decrease of 1.6% year-over-year and an increase of 36.8% quarter-over-quarter. Interest and investment income was RMB 1.4 billion, increased 288.7% year-over-year and 375% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily attributed to the recycling of unrealized gains from other comprehensive income to investment income of RMB 977.3 million for the available-for-sale debt related to upstream industry investment.Net loss was RMB 5.4 billion, representing a decrease of 7.2% year-over-year, and an increase of 17.8% quarter-over-quarter. Last but not least, our balance sheet gets strengthened with RMB 57.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term time deposits as of December 31, 2023. For more information details of our unaudited 2023 full year financial results, please refer to our earnings press release.Now, this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Your firs question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. I have 2 questions. The first one is about our upcoming mass-market agreement with Alps. So, is NIO still targeting to launch and deliver the first model on the Alps in [ late third ] quarter? And separately, as it is just less than 2 quarters away, could you share more information about the channel strategy, targeted numbers of stores, store types and the scale of our charging network et cetera. So, any additional colors about Alps would be highly appreciated. So, that's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. As I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the second quarter of this year, we are going to unveil our second brand, the brand for the mass market. And in the third quarter, we will launch the very first product of this new brand, and the mass release and delivery will be starting from the fourth quarter of this year. Actually, the verification build, the [ baby build ] of this car already rolled off the line in Q4 last year and we were pretty satisfied with the conditions of that build.In terms of the sales and service network of this new brand, for the point of sales, it will have its separated and independent sales network. But in terms of the after-sales services and the touch points, we do can leverage the existing service resources of the new brands.In terms of the power swap network, we've previously mentioned that for the power swap network, we have a private network and a public network, similar to the cloud infrastructure and cloud service. For the private network, basically, it's the power swap stations and the facilities that's designated and exclusive to the new brand. But in addition to that, we have a public network where we will share the power swapping resources with not only our second brand as well as other car companies. As you've also show -- know that we've already signed the agreements with several car companies and more will join the public service facility as well.[Interpreted] Our fourth generation power swap station will have the compatibility for both NIO products as well as Alps products, and we will start to build the fourth generation swap stations from April this year. Previously, we've mentioned that in 2024, we are going to install another 1,000 swap stations, and most of these stations will be fourth generation stations for the public network. Really appreciate all the details. So, my second question is now on the margin target because I recall that, back to third quarter results, I think the management team mentioned that vehicle gross profit margin for 2024, i.e. this year would be around 15% to 18%. And there could be additional like 0.5% margin uptick contributed by in-house production. So, based on current market environment and competitive landscape, do you still maintain the same target this year or [ ripped ] for any potential changes to the margin target? That's my second question. Tim, about the margin, yes, for the whole year, I think we keep this 15% to 18% target. But the quarter to -- by quarter, I think there will be some change. As you may know, we will upgrade our -- all our NT2 product to 2024 version in March. And during the transition of old and new products, more promotions are offered for the old models, leading to the decrease of gross profit margin in Q1.But starting from Q2, along with the volume ramp up of our 2024 version and also the further cost optimization activities as we mentioned, we believe our vehicle margin can come back to an upward trend. And so, starting from Q2, we are confident that 15% to 18% weaker margin can be achieved for NIO brands. And from a long run, our target -- our margin target for NIO brand will also be over 20%. Your next question comes from Ben Wang from Deutsche Bank. My first question is about 2024 volume targets. In the mid-year report, you target 200,000 units for the full year '24, which means 25% growth. Can you confirm whether this is your target? That's number one question. Number two is about a second product from the NIO brand, mass market brand. In a recent interview, Wei actually mentioned a full-size SUV bigger than the first one. There will be a second product followed by MPV. Can I confirm this is your plan for the -- your plan in the next second and third products? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Definitely, for this year, the competition is going to be -- continue to be intense. But as we've also mentioned that we will be having our products for the 2024 model with enhanced performance, especially much better computing power, the computing power will continue to lead the global market. So this will help us to improve the overall competitiveness of our investing into products. This year, we will focus on accelerating the software release so that we can release more new [Technical Difficulty] on the chips and computing power.And also in the second quarter, we are going to release our NOP+ for urban roads to all the NT2 users. By doing this public release, we can also enhance the competitiveness of the products. Plus, we also have other new features like large language models, large vision models and the NOMI GPT et cetera.In terms of our sales channel and the network, so far, we have around 500 NIO Houses and NIO Spaces, and we will continue to enlarge the reach of our sales and service network to the lower-tier cities. And in the meantime, from last year, we have enlarged our sales force as the team is getting more matured and skillful with the sales and getting more -- getting better understanding of our products. We also see this sales force start to kick in, especially in our delivery results for the February.Inside of the BEV segment or the new energy vehicle market, our delivery results in February was actually pretty good, especially in comparison to our results in January. This has also reflected the effectiveness and the efficiency of our sales force and also sales channel enlargement.And thirdly, we will also continue to deploy our power swapping network. As I've mentioned, we will deploy both public network and private networks for NIO and for Alps. And for our power swap network this year, we will mainly serve the purpose of boosting sales volume because we already have more than 2,000 swap stations. So we basically have established initial network for the power swap services, and now we will focus more on boosting sales via installing these stations.So, overall speaking, we are confident with our sales and the delivery results this year. As in our guidance, in the first quarter of this year, we are going to deliver around 31,000 to 33,000 units. In March, as whether it gets better and the market gets more dynamic and vibrant, we are also confident that our sales volume will increase. For the mid-term, we hope that our sales volume can still be back to around 20,000 units per month, and we hope that this can happen sooner.[Interpreted] And for your second question about our mass market brand, some media has already captured some of our publicly tested vehicles on the roads and also reported some sneak peeks of our very first product. For our second brand, as we've previously introduced, its overall positioning is to target at the family-oriented users, basically families of different sizes or for family of different sizes, we are going to launch different sizes of vehicles, but all with strong product competitiveness.As we started relatively late in the family-oriented segment, we do can leverage such opportunities to better look into the real demand of the target users and launched competitive products accordingly. The first product of our mass market brand will have head-on on competition with the most popular model of Tesla, that is Model Y. But our car will support battery swap. So in terms of the cost and performance, we believe that this model will be highly competitive.In terms of the BOM cost, it will be roughly 10% lower than that of Model Y, which also gives us better flexibility for the product pricing. And the second model of our mass market brand will be a SUV model for the large family. The R&D is in good progress. We have already kicked off the toolings for the second model, and this car will be launched in 2025. And the third model is also underway. We have already started product designation and R&D, but it's too early to share the information, and we will disclose more information when it's appropriate. Your next question comes from Yuqian Ding from HSBC. Thanks, team. Yuqian here. I've got 2 questions. The first is, we want to understand what is management's priority or strategy between pricing and volume? We noticed that the company acted quite refrained in pricing among universal price action from peers. Has that been -- we have been seeing the ticket price rather stable. So, does that read as more profitability as a priority over volume for this year or it's a rope-a-dope tactic before our new mass market brand coming to the market? That's the first one. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Starting in the second half of this year, NIO Group will sell 2 brands simultaneously. So strategy-wise, we have also differentiated for these 2 brands. For the NIO brand for this -- for now, we will not sell any products that will be cheaper than the existing ET5. Even for the products in our pipeline, we will be targeting at the premium segment, which means that our products for the NIO brand will be more gross margin oriented. We will be carrying more on the gross profit of our product than the volume. So we will not cut the prices. We'll enter the price war. We will not realize higher volume at the cost of our compromised margin or gross profit.And for the second brand, the brand for the mass market, it is targeted at the mass market and also for the family-oriented users, where the competition is also more intense. But luckily, it can leverage the existing electrification and smart technologies and infrastructures already developed by NIO. So it has certain advantages than starting a completely new brand from the ground up. For this second brand, we will be focusing more on the volume. So the volume is prioritized over the gross margin of the products. That's the overall strategy for these 2 brands. We believe that with this combined brand portfolio, it will also help us to realize a healthier, long-term sustainable development and operations. Got it. And my second question is, the recent 2 sessions talked about supporting SOEs to move more aggressively on the EV without constraint on the profitability. So it looks like another pressure and making the industry harder and harder to consolidate. So, thanks for the strong color on the new mass market brand and value proposition. I guess, this is us changing the way of asking other than the strong product, are we aggressive enough on the pricing? You talked about the volume priority, but if the pressure is going to be overhang for longer, are we be ready for being aggressive on the pricing for longer? [Interpreted] It's true that doing business in China, it's inevitable that we will face competitions coming from all types of car companies, including companies like Tesla, many start-ups from China, private companies well-established ones in China and also joint ventures and the state-owned enterprises. Overall speaking, the China's automotive market is a highly open market and such competition can actually benefit or bring benefits to the end users.However, it can be more difficult and challenging for car companies. But we believe that by the end of the day, those companies with good overall capabilities and competence as well as those companies who care about the experience of the end users will survive from the fierce competition. And we are confident that we will withstand such competition from all the competitors.But in the meantime, we also see cooperations out of the competition. For example, we have announced power swap cooperation with many car companies. China Automobile is the first car company to partner with NIO in power swap. Later, we also collaborated with Geely Holding, JAC Group and Chery on the battery swap.We also have partnerships with energy companies like Sinopec and PetroChina for the construction of power swap stations as well as with China Southern Power Grid on the energy storage as well as power swap stations. So, in general, NIO is pretty good at partnering up with the peers in the industry. Since the competition is inevitable, we would like to look at how we can navigate through the intense competition from the reasonability of the business perspective. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America. So, I also have 2 questions. So first question is regarding the overseas market. Do you expect NIO to enter the new countries this year? Will you cooperate with more local distributors in other overseas market or you will maintain the direct sales business model? Also, do you have any overseas sales target for this year? That's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding the global market or international markets, at the moment, we will still primarily focus on the Chinese market as it is the largest and also the most competitive market for the automotive industry. But, in the meantime, we will not stop our exploration into the international markets.So far, we have already entered 5 European countries, and we will keep refining our operations and management in these 5 European countries. And this year, we are also planning to enter into several new countries. For example, UAE, as we are invested by the Abu Dhabi strategic investors So we are also preparing for the market entry and the sales and service in that market.For the other countries, we are more waiting to see the development of the conditions and strategic wise, we will also become more flexible because there are 2 major changes. The first change is that as we will soon have our mass market brand and the next year, we are going to announce our third brand. The price will be below RMB 200,000, which means that with all 3 brands combined, we will be able to cover larger markets with more segments, because NIO as a brand, primarily focused on the premium segment, basically China, U.S. and Europe.These 3 continents contribute 90% of the sales of the premium segment. But for our second and third brands, as they are more affordable, they will be standing a bigger chance of tapping into a more diversified markets and in more regions. So, our global market entry will also take these 3 brands into consideration.And the second change is regarding our strategy entering into each market. At the moment, in China and in 5 European countries, we adopted a direct selling model. And in China, we will continue to have the direct sale with -- direct touch points with users. But for the other markets outside of China, we need to respect the local conditions and also the special characteristics of each market.In that case, we will keep our strategy very flexible and very open. We will look at which way we'll be bringing us quicker return on investment. We don't exclude any possibilities of cooperating with local partners for the market entry. So in general, we will have a very flexible and very open strategy towards markets outside of China. My second question is -- my second question is regarding the battery technology. So recently, some auto brands started to launch 5C 800-volt charging battery and the system. So when do we expect that the NIO brand and also probably your second brand will start to provide this spec? And if after you have a fast-charging battery, will you switch to expand more charging station instead of battery substation in 2025? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. In terms of the battery technologies, actually, NIO has been having this long-standing strategy of studying the ultrafast charging as well as ultra quick battery swapping. In terms of charging, actually, NIO is the most active brand in terms of deploying public chargers for the users in China. And as of now, 80% of our [ electricity ] were charged for the non-NIO users than for the NIO users.For the NIO Power's charging business by itself, it is already breaking even, and we will continue to deploy the chargers for the users. Very soon, we are going to install and launch our 640 kilowatt power chargers. So, definitely, we will follow the latest technologies in the charging industry. In the meantime, we also need to emphasize on how fast the power swap can be because no matter how quick you are on the charging rate, it can never outrun the power swap. Some media has used the analogy where power swap is as fast as charging at 20C in comparison to 5C on a common charger. Not to mention that battery swap also have the best experience for the users.And in NIO's holistic solution, in addition to chargeable and swappable, we also have upgradable, which is also very important, especially to serve the interests of our users. Very soon, we are going to have our 150-kilowatt-hour battery. We also have a 5C charging rate that will become available on our first model from the third-generation products, ET9.But in addition to looking at the battery capacity and the charging rate, what really matters is the lifetime of the battery. For that, we think that it's very important because at the moment, the industry average warranty duration is around 8 years or a 100,000 kilometers something or when the battery hit 70% state of health. But if you look at the vehicle, it has a life cycle of around 15 years.For most of the electric vehicles running on the street, they haven't really hit the end of life of their batteries yet. But as the car companies, we really need to consider about the 15-year life cycle of your products, including cars, including batteries. That's why the calendar lifetime of the batteries becomes more important for the car companies.Over the past several years, we have tackled the difficulties on the battery safety, efficiency of charging and also the accessibilities of the charging and swapping facilities. And from this year, we will focus on the long life batteries. We have already done some research and studies on the technologies and recently, we are going to share more information with the industry.What we believe is that with a longer battery life, especially longer calendar life, it will help not only the battery electric vehicles, but also PHEVs and EREVs or the new energy vehicles in general. Because after 8 years, when the battery hits its end of warranty life, you cannot ask the user to pay another RMB 100,000 to upgrade the battery or to buy a new battery.Even for a smaller battery pack of only 40 kilowatt hour capacity, you cannot ask them to pay RMB 80,000 or RMB 90,000 for a brand new battery. So as a car company, we needed to look after both battery and cars across -- or throughout its life cycle. In that case, we needed to provide the ultimate battery solution to the industry. Your next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. My first question is regarding your R&D budget for 2024. How much do you plan to spend into R&D for this year? And if you can, would you please give a rough breakdown, how much of this would go to the NIO models and how much go to the Alps? How much do go to the third brand and how much go to the autonomous driving software and some key components, et cetera? Yes. So, regarding the R&D spending plan for 2024. Paul, this is Stanley. Regarding your question about the R&D expense expectation for 2024. Generally, the scale of R&D expense will be consistent with 2023. And on average, the quarterly spendings for R&D will also be around RMB 3 billion. Yes, that's the general guidance for R&D. [Interpreted] In terms of how to allocate the R&D expenses this year, we will mostly allocate our resources on the fundamental technologies as well as the technologies that can be shared across all 3 brands. We have mainly focused on the smart and electric technologies, which can already be shared across NIO Alps and also Firefly, which is our third brand. And last year, in September, we have announced our 12 full-stack technologies at the NIO Inc. Tech Day. And basically, our R&D investments will be dedicated into these 12 main areas. And in terms of the personnel structure, around 70% of our R&D people are focusing on the smart technologies were relevant areas. No, sure. My second question is regarding the cost of Alps. Just now I think you mentioned that the cost is going to be about 10% lower than Tesla. Can we give a little bit more color given this is actually pretty impressive number when you consider Tesla is building almost 1 million cars in China a year of which 700,000 is already like Model Y. What volume scale are you based on to assume the Alps' costs, and what are the key advantages that you have adopted for this cost advantage compared to Tesla? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Actually, for Tesla, as they also public their gross margin details on the product, so it's easy for us to make a comparison. In terms of what advantages we can take for the Alps and its cost structure, actually, China is the largest automotive market. It is also the biggest market for the smart electric vehicles with already well-established supply chain.So we can already leverage the advantages of the domestic supply chains here in China, not to mention that in the past several years, we have made investments and also we achieved accumulations on the R&D activities. And R&D is one of the key drivers of improving the cost structure and reducing the BOM cost of the product.In that case, we already have a pretty good foundation. And with that, we doesn't needed to really realize a very huge volume to realize that level of cost structure. In China, for the manufacturing facility, a reasonable volume will be around 10,000 units per month. We don't need to really go to the level of 1 million to realize that level of BOM cost. So the costs here are compared to Tesla China or Tesla Global for the 10%. Sorry, just a quick follow-up. [Interpreted] Yes, to translate for that, we didn't really look at the Tesla China specifically, we are comparing with Tesla globally. Your next question comes from Chang Jing from CICC. Okay. I have 2 quick follow-on questions. The first is also about the charging and also battery swap network. We can see that our network is still -- our construction progress of the charging network is still the fastest in China. But at the same time, we see many other companies are still also accelerating their construction of the -- especially the fast charging network. So how do we think that we can maintain our first-mover advantage? And also how do we look at the relationship between fast charging and also battery swap? [Interpreted] Thank you for the questions. As we are very happy to see that many other car companies, including peers as well as other third-party companies are also dedicating their resources into installing chargers in China, as the more chargers we have publicly, the better the charging experience and the charging efficiency will be. So we are also dedicating -- or actually we are also installing a lot of charges.But in addition to that, we also have many power swapping facilities. We are the car company with the most power swap stations. Some companies in the industry are also installing power swap stations, but so far, we are still the single largest swap station operators with already establishing -- with that, we have already established a very good network effect where we can further leverage on that.So, overall speaking, many other car companies who are serious about the battery swap or who are interested in battery swap, now choose to join our battery swapping network and alliance because they can also rely on our network effect. But another thing is that the charging and swapping, these two are never in conflict with each other. Of course, for the charging, there are some special benefits. For example, if you have chargers at home, you can always enjoy the best charging experience or if you are on the go and you only need to charge for 20% or 30% SoC, you can also choose faster charter. But if you need to have a full charge in a very short time frame, power swap is still the best option for you.Like during the Spring Festival, over 90% of our users traveling on highways chose to do the power swap than doing their charging. So, that's the special benefit of power swap, not to mention that battery swap station itself is a natural energy storage system. When users are doing power swap, they don't need to get off the car. The entire process is fully automated, not to mention that we also have a battery upgrade that is enabled by the swappabilities of the battery.For example [Technical Difficulty] 80% of them chose a 100-kilowatt hour battery pack. That is our long-range backer pack. But before we had this many power swap stations in China, 50% of our users actually chose a 100-kilowatt hour battery pack. By having more users choosing standard range battery packs, the benefit is that if you're only driving the car in Shanghai for the daily commute, you can be having a sufficient range with 75 kilowatt hour. But when you need to have a weekend getaway, where you need to travel for long distance during the holidays like during the Spring Festival, you can use the flexible battery upgrade to upgrade to 100-kilowatt hour battery.For example, during the Spring Festival, many of our users have chosen to upgrade their batteries flexibly. And very soon, we will launch a 150 kilowatt hour battery pack, which will fulfill a very rare need, maybe only 1% to 2% of the use cases where users needed to travel much longer.And another benefit of power swap is regarding how it can benefit the management of the battery life because, I can use the analogy, if you eat too fast, it can damage your stomach than eating in a very slow manner. It's the similar thing to the power swap because if you always use supercharging, such quick charge may damage the battery life of your battery. But with battery swap, we can balance out the battery life, not to mention that we can also use other operating approaches and mechanism to further enhance the battery life. So, overall speaking, we don't think battery swap and charging are conflicting with each other and these 2 actually [indiscernible]. Okay. My second question is regarding to the lower tier cities market. And I see that in 2023, our sales proportion in first tier cities has been increased a little bit percent. So will also our sales proportionally -- especially in third tier and below, is still less than 20%. So compared to like BMW, which that will be exceeding 40%. So in terms of marketing and other aspects, so do we have some efforts to break through further to the lower tier cities? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. It's true that in 2024, we needed to solve the problem regarding enlarging our reach in the lower-tier cities and also boosted the sales in those cities. We have realized the significance of this, and we have already started to take actions in the second half of 2023 by enlarging our reach into the lower-tier cities.Right now, if you look at our sales volume distribution, basically more than 50% of our sales volume is contributed by the sales in the Yangtze River Delta areas. And if we look at all the Tier 1 cities, more than 70% of the sales actually happen in the first tier cities. So it's very important for us to find the right approach to penetrate into the lower-tier cities and enlarge our channel reach in these cities.On the other hand, we have also realized that the infrastructure like the charging and the swapping facilities are also playing a very important role in boosting the sales in these lower-tier cities. So this year, we will also focus on installing more chargers and swap stations in this third -- in the third or fourth tier cities so that we can enhance the overall user experience and the competitiveness in those areas. This is an opportunity as well as a challenge for us in 2024. We need to find the efficient approach to tap into the lower tier cities and to improve the sales volume in those areas. Your next question comes from Tina Hou from Goldman Sachs. So the first question is regarding your sales network and sales team expansion plan this year. So just wondering for both the NIO rand and for the Alps brand, how many new stores do you expect to open this year, and how many new sales people do you expect to hire for each of these brands? Hi, Tina. Can you repeat your question, please? Sorry. So, my first question is regarding your sales network and sales team expansion. So, could you share for 2024, how many stores do you plan to open for both NIO and the Alps brand? And also how many sales people do you expect to hire for these brands? [Interpreted] Thank you for your questions. For NIO, as the brand, actually, we have already opened 500 NIO Houses and NIO Space in China. So for this year, our priority is not on opening up more stores or spaces for the NIO brand. Instead, we will focus on improving the efficiency of each point of sale, including phasing out some low-efficiency locations and replace them with stores and locations of higher efficiencies.And in terms of the sales force for the NIO brand, so far, we have already have more than 5,000 people on the team. And enlarging the team will not be the focus either, instead, we will focus on the efficiency of the overall operations of the team. So enlarging sales team, we're increasing the number of self-stores for NIO will not be the priority for the current year.But when it comes to our new brand, the second brand, the approach will be different. We have already secured some locations and resources for the new brand. So we will not have a very long lead time to prepare for the store opening. Basically, when we launched the brand, we also hope that we can open no less than 200 points of sales for the second brand.In terms of people, it's the same logic, as we can leverage the existing training system of NIO to train the team, to make the entire sales team to be prepared for the launch of the very first model. So we will focus on the efficiency of such sales team. Not to mention that for Alps, they will start with only one product. So the efficiency of the cells be relatively easy to manage and improve. This is also another advantage of starting a brand based on existing resources and the network of NIO than starting everything from ground up. William, can I just have a follow-up? So would the Alps store location resemble that of NIO's location? [Interpreted] As Alps, our second brand, is targeting at different types of user groups with different price segments and the range, which means that this brand will also have its own principal and logic for the store locations and network development. So for Alps, they will select their own stores and locations and also deploy the network according to their own demand.[Interpreted] And of course, the sales network of Alps will also be more efficient as Alps does not need to have the full-fledged sales stores like NIO House. So its -- point of sales will be more efficiency oriented, similar to the sales stores of Tesla. And my second question is, could you give us some CapEx guidance for 2024? And then the breakdown between vehicle CapEx and also your charging/swapping infrastructure CapEx? Yes, sure. We will control our CapEx investment in 2024. Like we already canceled a delayed project with payback period longer than 2 to 3 years. And generally, the CapEx in this year will be significantly lower than 2023. Regarding the deployment of our power swap station network, we will fully leverage the resources of our business partners for the further expansion, as mentioned in [ William's ] previous statements. Yes, that means we'll utilize our own resource to build the network. So, will not utilize your own resource? Yes, for the power swap network -- station network, we've minimized the use of our own resource. That's very -- yes, that's very clear and helpful. Thank you. As there are no further questions now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you, again, for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's Investor Relations team through the contact information on our website. This concludes the conference call.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2024 Q1 earnings call. In Q1, NIO delivered 30,053 premium smart EV. In Q2, thanks to the launch of all model year products unleash of sales capabilities together with a more flexible sales policy. NIO's deliveries started to pick up month by month. In April, NIO delivered 15,620 vehicles and in May, 20,544 vehicles.
Our market share in the premium BEV segment continued to grow, with year-over-year growth far above the segment average. The total deliveries in Q2 is expected to be between 54,000 and 56,000 units, up 129.6% to 138.1% year-over-year. In terms of NIO's financial performance,  model year product transition in Q1. The vehicle margin was 9.2%.
In the meantime, with the improvement on the utilization of the charging and the swapping facility and on the profitability of the after-sales services. Gross loss on the other sales was greatly reduced quarter-over-quarter.
Now I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations. On April 25, the ET7 executive edition was launched at Beijing Auto Show. The delivery of executive edition has started in late April. With around upgrades, the 2024 NIO ET7 batch caters to the needs of business community. It is well placed to compete with the premium exec model especially ICE models such as BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and the Mercedes E-Class.
In terms of NAD, on April 30, we started to push urban to all users, making it the largest release of its cars accessible by more than users 260,000 and over 1.4 million kilometers of highway and urban street and in 726 cities in China. has been an industry leader in terms of its user base and the coverage during the Labor Day holiday, 48.1% of the total mileage was driven with NOP+, making user journeys safer and more relaxing.
Since day 1, NIO has developed a clear brand road map starting from the premium segment to build up skills and experience and then introducing a mass market brand to reach and serve more users. With that, we will be able to make greater contributions to a more sustainable future. On May 15, at the International Day of Family, we introduced a new brand for the mainstream family market. is from on voyage and its Chinese name translates into path to happiness. Our mission to make family life better is committed to bringing products with the ultimate business value and optimal ownership cost. The preorder of its first product, L16, was started. L16 is a smart electric midsized SUV. The official product launch and the delivery will begin in September. 
Launch of has shipped us into higher steel, expanding our reach to a wider user base. As more people are aware of our technologies and the products we will add close to our vision of blue sky company. As for the sales and service network, so far, NIO has 154 NIO houses and 388 NIO bases as well as 344 service centers and 64 delivery centers.
About the charging and the swapping network, so far, NIO has 2,472 stations worldwide, and has provided over 45 million swaps. Besides, NIO has also installed over 22,000 power chargers and the destination chargers. In the meantime, more industry players have joined NIO's charging and swapping network. As of now, we have partnered with JAC, Cherry, Lotos, GAC and SAW to jointly expand the standard battery swapping network.
More investors have taken notice and recognize the value of NIO's charging and the swapping business. On May 31, NIO Power signed our strategic investment agreement of RMB 1.5 billion with the support of strategic investors, NIO will be able to further develop its core technologies and expand the network. On May 13, NIO was named in the 2024 Fortune China ESG impact We have continued to show the social responsibilities and lead by example in the ESG domain to further contribute to sustainable development worldwide.
Despite the fierce competition, our continuous investment in technologies, products, service, services and the community starts to pay off and set us apart from others. NIO's premium brand positioning, industry-leading technologies and innovate chargeable, swappable and upgradable power experience have been recognized by more people and that driven steady CSV bound.
We will continue to speed our software intuition, optimize products and experiences improved system capabilities and operational efficiency to gain a larger market share. In the meantime, as the company unfolds is a multi-brand strategy and enter a broader market, we expect to bring out more potential for growth. As always, thank you for your support.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Steven for Q1 financial details. Over to you, Steven. Thank you, William. I will now go over our key financial results for the first quarter of 2024. To keep this brief, I only refer to amounts in RMB today. I encourage listeners to refer to our earnings press release, which is posted online for additional details.
Let's begin with revenue. For the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2024, total revenues were RMB 9.9 billion, down 7.2% year-over-year and 42.1% quarter-over-quarter. 85% of revenue comes from vehicle sales in Q1, totaling RMB 8.4 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year and 45.7% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease year-over-year was mainly attributed to lower average selling price as a result of user rights adjustments since June 2023 and a decrease in delivery volume.
The decrease quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to a 40% decrease in delivery volume, which was affected by seasonal factors. Turning to other sales. Other sales were RMB 1.5 billion, showing a 5.2% increase year-over-year an 8.2% decrease quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year growth was mainly due to the increase in sales of parts after sales vehicle services and professional power solutions, which grew with our user base and partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales of used cars and auto financing services.
The decrease quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to a decrease in revenue from sales of used cars. Then let's have a look at the gross margin. Overall gross margin was 4.9% compared with 1.5% in the same period of last year at 10.5% in the last quarter. Changes in gross margin were primarily driven by vehicle margins.  margin was 9.2% in this quarter compared with 5.1% in Q1 2023 and 11.9% in Q4 2023. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the decreased material cost per unit in Q1 2024.
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to lower average price as a result of increased promotion during product transitioning, changes in product mix and partially offset by the decreased material costs per unit. Next, moving on to the operating expenses. expenses were RMB 2.9 billion declined 6.9% year-over-year and 27.9% quarter-over-quarter, which has been driven by decreased design and development costs and decreased ethanol costs in research and functions in the first quarter of 2024.
SG&A expenses were RMB 3 billion, increased by 22.5% year-over-year and decreased by 24.6% quarter-to-quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to: first, the increase in personnel costs related to sales functions. Second, the increase in expenses related to the complete sales and service network expansion; and third, the increase in sales and marketing activities. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to: first, the decrease in sales and marketing activities and professional services; and second, the decrease in personnel costs related to sales and general corporate functions.
Now we proceed to the bottom line. for operations was RMB 5.4 billion, representing an increase of 5.5% year-over-year and a decrease of 18.6% quarter-over-quarter. Net loss was RMB 4.2 billion, representing an increase of 9.4% year-over-year and a decrease of 3.4% quarter-over-quarter. And finally, our balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term time deposits was RMB 45.3 billion as of March 31, 2024.
For more information and details of our first quarter 2024 financial results, please refer to our earnings press release. Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator to proceed our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. Congratulations on a good feedback on and some strategic power. I have 2 questions. The first question is about the gross profit margin because as you remember, the company previously guided gross profit margin would be back to mid-teens as the strategic focus of NIO brand is profitability and cash generation, while would be the 1 going for volume.
However, we saw increasing promotion for new in April and May, which worked pretty well actually and successfully boost the volume. Will management consider to continue this kind of more aggressive promotion on NIO brand for better volume in the upcoming months? And do we need to revise down our margin expectation? That's my first question. Thank you, Tim. I will ask Stanley to answer the first question. Yes, regarding the gross margin, actually, we upgraded our product to 2024 version in -- from March. During the transition period, of the model year product change, more promotions were offered to the automotives, leading to the decrease of our average selling price in Q1. And additionally, more lower margin models like ET5 and ET5 T were sold in Q1. All those factors lead to the decrease of our gross margin.
As you mentioned, we delivered over 20,000 vehicles to users in May with the recovery of sales volume. We will further optimize our product mix and negotiate with our supply chain partners for more cost efficiency in the following months. So we expect the vehicle margin will returned to double digits in Q2 and continued to improve in Q3 and Q4 Yes. But considering the intensifying market competition, we will also be more flexible on sales policy to make sure our market position is secure. My second question is about power. As just mentioned, I think NIO Power secures the first external strategic investment of $1.5 billion or around USD 200 million. So looking for, well, NIO Power get and accept more funding support from other car makers in the battery swap alliance?
And separately, in addition to NIO Power, is there any other tack-ons or business units within the group that could follow through to seek external capital injection and be gradually carved out? Could management team give us some examples? That's my second question. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. For the NIO Power, we have just completed the first round of fundraising. And after this round of financing, NIO still has around 90% of equity in new power. And NIO Power is now open for the external investors, be it investment from the investors were from the car companies, we are open for that. Of course, for the longer term, we do believe that New Power has a financial sustainability because we do have a promising and positive outlook for that.
At the starting stage as we needed to build up the network for the power swap facilities, the upfront investment is relatively heavy. However, we do see a clear road map for the profitability with new power. Let me share with you a number. right now for the breakeven point of a single power substation, it's around 60 swaps per day. And if you look at our current power swap service, every day on average, we offer around 100,000 power swaps with around 2,000 stations.
It means that for each station on average, they are already providing around 30 swabs per day. So for the longer term, we do see a viable road map for the sustainability and also the profitability of our power swap business. Not to mention that we can also leverage the revenues contributed by the energy storage and also the flexible battery upgrade of the power swamp. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America. William and the management team. This is Ming-Hsun from Bank of America. So my first question is regarding So right now, we are close to the end of second quarter. So could you give us some guidance regarding on your sales channel expansion and also CapEx expense related to ongoing brand? And then also, could you give us a rough product pipeline for the brands. That's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you for your question. Our current plan is that when we started to launch and deliver the first product of in September this year, we are going to open up around 100 stores in China. CapEx less as sales stores or point of sales does not come with new house, which does not require heavy investment. In that case, the overall CapEx will be pretty efficient, around RMB 1 million to RMB 2 million per store. It won't be a very heavy burden from the CapEx perspective. Pipeline for Amobi. For example, like this year and then maybe next year, is it? [Interpreted] Regarding the product line, actually, the first product, L6, it will be directly competing with Model Y. It's a mid-sized SUV for family users. And next year, we are going to introduce the second product from Ambu. It will be a mid-large SUV for bigger families. We also have other products in the pipeline.
But overall speaking, for we will not have many products in its offering, we will be focusing on enhancing the market share and also the sales volume of each product in their respective segment. Overall speaking, the total sales volume for on both segments, which is a family car market with a starting price of around RMB 200,000. The total size is around RMB 4 million. And we do believe that we have a good opportunity and room for growth in that segment. And my second question is related to your because we wanted the news today that the brand could be launched or show to the market probably by the end of this year? And could you also give us some latest update on the brand? And last time during the earnings call, you mentioned that probably  brand product could be sell in new households space. So could you confirm on this network strategy. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding our third brand, Firefly, the R&D activities are in good progress. Several months ago, I've already tried 1 of the early builds of their first model, and it's pretty good. Regarding the Firefly product in the Chinese market, it will be target -- it will be able to compact vehicle. Although its price segment is around RMB 100,000 to RMB 200,000, but it will follow a very high standard for the safety and the quality. So it will be a well-designed boutique car for the Chinese market.
In terms of the sales channel, it will also share the point of sales with new just like how many is sharing its dealership source with BMW. We will be using a similar approach. However, the selling price of Firefly will not be as expensive as many product-wise, it is definitely a very good project. We will start the product delivery from the first half of next year brand launch and the product launch, we don't have the specific date for that, but the delivery date is already more or less defined.
That is the first half of next year. Your next question comes from Deutsche Bank. My question is about margin because you will migrate to the 3.0 this year. So all the NIO brand products migrate from 2.0 to 3.0, how much margin improve we can achieve through the technology upgrade. At the same time, based on 3.0 technology can provide a volume assumption to reach the overall company that's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding NIO brands, starting from next year, we will gradually upgrade our product to the third generation, and the first product on will be And for the third-generation product, we will also take different approaches to improve the vehicle margin. For example, we will start to put more in-house technologies into our vehicles, like chips for better vehicle margin performance.
We also see some opportunities with the battery cost reductions. So overall speaking, our target for the T3 product margin will be around on average. And we do have a confidence of realizing that average margin of 20% from NT3. And regarding the breakeven target for the new brand, our target is still the same, that is to realize the monthly source volume of 30,000 units with a vehicle margin of around 20%, and then we will be breaking even with the core business of a new brand in China.
And regarding our second brand on we have announced the presale price during the product launch -- during the brand launch, but we haven't released the final price yet. Even with the presale price, we can realize a pretty good vehicle margin. Of course, we also understand that the competition in segments is more intense than new in that case will also strike a balance between the volume and the margin.
We will not boost the sales volume at a cost of our vehicle margin. And for the longer term, our targets were products our margin target for products will also be above or even around or even above 15%. Because looking at Tesla, their current product margin is around 16% to 17%. And for realizing a margin of above 15% is also a reasonable and triple target for us in the longer term.
For brand to break even its monthly sales volume should be at least 20,000 to 30,000 units per month. My second question is about the order backlog for overall you actually interviewed said that you are very traction about on those initial order backlog, some market talk is that you already have 60,000 cancelable order right now. Can you comment on that number and how you are about on the orders so far? [Interpreted] As you know that for us, we never disclose any preorder intake or numbers as the preorders are refundable, and we don't see it's a very solid reference for us to look at the actual performance of the product. However, it is true that with the preorder intake, it has surpassed our expectations as also mentioned by the President of in some interviews.
So overall speaking, without opening up any stores or having products to the market, we have already received the preorder set beyond our expectation. That's the information we can share. Your next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. Two questions. The first question is you mentioned that right now, you have 2,400 swap stations. To my personal understanding only the third generation latest battery swap stations could help onboard to swap the batteries. Could you please remind us how many units of the later generation battery swap stations could help for the unfold swap. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. For our third-generation power substation to be compatible with products, we do need to make some necessary modification. It is not a very expensive one, around RMB 200,000 to RMB 300,000 station for the modification. So far, we have already installed more than 1,000 third generation power station. So that will be a base.
In the meantime, we actually next week, we will start to install our fourth generation power swap stations, and these stations will be compatible with both on and new products. And also later this year, depending on the market and the demand, we will also see and decide how many fourth generation stations we need to deploy for new and onboard products that all fourth generation stations can be accessed by 1 products probably with that by end of the year, in the market, there will be more than 1,000 stations that can be compatible with on more products.
Of course, it doesn't mean that we will modify or a generation stations to onboard users as not every station needs to be modified or opened up to the second brand. Not to mention that to start with will not have a very big user base for the current year. In that case, the experience of both brands will be pretty good.
In the meantime, we also see some correlations between the number of power swap stations for the density of power swap stations in certain regions and the performance in that region. For example, in the area, basically, half of our users are based out in that area. And in this area, we have already installed nearly 900 power swap stations. So there is a correlation between the number of stations and the number of stores.
In that case, we are also developing an ROI model to calculate the return on the power swap station investment. In that case, our of the power swap station and the decision on the deployment will be also relevant to their contributions to the sales volume be it sales of NIO or sales the brand. As right now, we have already initially established a charging and swapping network for China to cover most of the basic needs. For the next step, we will look closely the return on the investment of all the power swap stations, especially the return on the sales volume. In that case, our deployment next step will also be more targeted. So my second question is regarding the NIO's license permit. I think you are among the first batch to receive the autonomous drive and testing license permit. How do you plan to utilize this opportunity? And how should you further develop on the autonomous driving technologies. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Yes, 2 years ago, we have received the L3 testing permit issued by ministries, including MIIT. And also among all the start-ups, we are one of the earliest to receive the first batch of permit issued by the government. This also represents a recognition of our technology.
For the next step with the permit with the testing capability, we will be able to keep more frequent communications with the government regarding the application and also the testing of the higher levels of autonomous driving technologies, which will also be very important for the entire industry. Your next question comes from Yuqian Ding from HSBC. My first question is probably still an extra mile on the margin pricing. So second quarter, probably we're going to see higher economic scale, almost doubled versus the first quarter, yet the promotion and also lower mix likely to remain dilution. So you talked about flexible on pricing earlier. So could you put us in a bit more context about how we prioritize pricing mix and volume and each of them are waiting on the margin side? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. In the April and also May, we have witnessed the increase in our sales volume, but such increase is actually due to multiple factors. The first is we have just completed our model year face lifts in the first quarter of this year.
With that, it has significantly improved the competitiveness of our product. And secondly, we have adjusted our vast policy. This March, we have announced our long-life battery strategy and also the adjustments to monthly subscription fee by optimizing our operations and also working with our battery suppliers for longer battery warranty, we can prolong the lifetime of the battery and lower the monthly fee for our users.
This is actually a very important approach to boost the take rate of the bus service after the announcements and the adjustments the take rate of the Battery as a Service has raised to more than 80%. Also, we are offering some time limited promotions on the bus service. Right now, our users can buy 4 months of the best and enjoy 1 month for free.
The third reason is regarding the improvement on our sales capabilities and capacity. In the second half of last year, we realized that we didn't have enough sales capacities and capabilities which means we didn't have enough point of sale where the sales persons on team. In that case, we started to build our sales capacity and capabilities. And starting March, April this year, we are seeing more and more qualified follows to contribute the sales and also orders to the company. So these are several major reasons that are boosting our sales volume in the past 2 months.
In addition to that, there are several other reasons. For example, we are deploying and opening up 1 more power swap stations -- more and more people are also getting to know and starting to recognize the value of chargeable, swappable and upgradable solution. And also, we have a pretty stable residual value on our used vehicles.
Recently, there was a evaluation coming from the industry institution and the S8 and several other new models actually have the best RV performance among all the BEV products. So it is not just about the adjustments on the prices, not to mention that we haven't announced any price reductions on our product. We are offering some promotions like Battery as a Service policy promotions were some trading incentives for the ICE part users, but no price reductions on the product. 
In the meantime, we also will continue to improve our vehicle margin. So starting June we are taking several actions. The first is to keep improving our product mix. We have started to deliver our ET7 in late April. ET7 and the ET7 they are pretty competitive in their respective segments. And we will also encourage our frontline teams and our follows to put more focus on this high-margin product to help us optimize product mix.
And secondly, we are also optimizing our variable marketing expenses. Starting in June, we are also dialing back on our time limited offers and promotions on the products. For example, we are reducing the number of free power swap broachers we gave out to our users. So overall speaking, we will keep improving our sales volume steadily we are optimizing the vehicle margin. That's very comprehensive. The next question is on the overseas business. The Europe unit entity subsidy investigation towards China EV might come out as a preliminary result next week. So could we have an update refresher on NIO's overseas footprint, including Europe and also Middle East? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. It's true that the entire industry is waiting for the preliminary announcement on the anti-subsidy probe of Europe. From our perspective, we don't think such progress in the right direction. Imposing tariffs on the new energy vehicles is actually going against the initiative of the sustainable development of all human kind.
Of course, we will also adjust our directions and strategies according to the latest change on the tariffs of products. Overall speaking, at the moment, European -- the south in our European market is still quite moderate in comparison to our total vehicle sales. So the impact on our short-term operations is limited. For the longer term, be for new or for onload Firefly product, we will also develop and make necessary adjustments to our strategies according to the latest tariff policy.
Regarding the Middle East market entry later this year, we are going to start to offer our products and services in the UAE market. We are making market entry preparation right now. Your next question comes from Jing Chang from CICC. My first question is a quick follow-up question about -- so can we share with us more information on the financial impact of the major, especially fast policy adjustment for first quarter, such as our vast rental fee adjustment and also our 441 battery rental and also our light battery swap coupon, this financial impact, especially for fear for our income statement. And this is my first question. Yes, about the price adjustment, I think 2 parts. First is about the price reduction from like 180  to 728, currently material impact to news revenue and gross profit margin. I think as mentioned by William, we make this adjustment based on the assumptions that the battery can used for a longer time and also some optimization of the battery operations. So that's the first.
And secondly, about the promotions used for months and 1 month for free. We granted this equity to the users for 5 years. So generally, the financial impact of this promotion is about below 6,000 per car -- so that's the general impact of this policy. My second question is about also for our online also Firefly. So this year, we will have on our first car in net zero to be launched. And our 3 sub-brands, including new will form a quite complete product matrix in next year. So can you share more information on this different positions and also the different relationships to these 3 brands? And also in what aspects can we collaborate. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding the positioning of our 3 different brands, actually, they are very clearly differentiated. For NIO, it is a premium brand target business-oriented users and business communities also have a deal over to the family-oriented users. For it targets the premium family market mass market. So its target users very clear family users.
For Firefly, as I've mentioned, in China, it will be an affordable boutique compact car. We target the family-oriented users especially those families who are buying Firefly as their second vehicle. That's about the positioning of these 3 brands. Price-wise, it is also pretty clear the starting prices of brands will be around RMB 100,000, RMB 200,000 and RMB 300,000. That is also clearly differentiated. However, these 3 brands do share a similarity that is power swap all your brands can support power swap.
In addition to power swap, 3 brands also shared the fundamental capabilities for smart technologies, electrification and also vehicle engineering capabilities. For example, when it comes to smart technologies, software-wise, hardware-wise, 3 brands can share quite a lot of synergies.
For the power swap stations, as you've already -- as we've already mentioned, NIO and will be sharing the same power swap station and also structure. For the vehicle engineering, there are also quite a lot of capabilities that can be shared across all 3 brands. In terms of manufacturing and production, the first model of L60 will be manufactured in new second factory, so from this perspective, you can tell how much synergies we can leverage and how much investment we can share across your brands. Your next question comes from Tina Hou from Goldman Sachs. So my first question is regarding actually just now William mentioned to keep the volumes steadily increase and then to improve gross margin. So [Foreign Language] So can we interpret this as for the upcoming months? We do expect the vehicle volume to be above 20,000 units per month. That's my first question. [Interpreted] It's true that we do see a pretty stable demand on our products. Recently, we do have several small headaches. For example, in May, actually, the order demand has exceeded our production capacity. So the actual deliveries we achieved in May basically means the maximum vehicle -- maximum number of vehicles we can produce for that month. So we do see a steady and sustainable growth momentum on our order intake, and we have a confidence of continuing that. Can I just have a quick follow-up for -- so for the -- I think starting from September, you will start to deliver So does the 20,000 units sort of forecast or target include or exclude. [Interpreted] After the launch of brand, we actually see positive impact on the sales of a new project. It hasn't affected the demand on the new projects. In the meantime, we are also training the operators and also the frontline teams so that we can get ready for the production of products. We may also arrange dual shifts in certain production lines or sections to fulfill the demand of both brands and the products. Regarding whether this number you've just mentioned well, if it is -- if it has included the volume assumptions for go, actually, it does not. That is only the assumption for the new brand. That's very clear, Will. And then my second question is regarding the operating expenses. So first on SG&A. In the first quarter, we see SG&A actually increased by 22% year-over-year. So should we expect a similar type of increase in the following 3 quarters and also actually starting from September since there will be 100 new stores for So in that -- like the last quarter, should we expect SG&A expense to grow even higher -- and then in terms of R&D, on the other hand, I see it down 7% year-over-year.
So for like overall R&D expense, what kind of annual spending level do you think it will be like a sustainable or a steady state kind of expense for us to keep competitive in terms of our hardware and software technology. Yes. Regarding the operating expense, the first is about selling expense. Actually, in Q1, our marketing activities decreased considering the impact of Chinese New Year Festival and also the seasonal change. Starting from Q2, we are expecting that the percentage of selling expense against the vehicle revenue will be improved if our sales growth quarter-over-quarter can be achieved as planned.
So that's about selling price. Along with the launch of Ambo, we don't think the efficiency will be like damaged since with the volume increase of we will have larger sales revenue. So this is about the efficiency of selling expense. For the R&D expense, the fluctuation in Q1 is in line with the cadence of our R&D activities especially the development of new vehicle models and cortex.
Generally, the forecast for R&D expense in 2024 will be consistent with 2023. That is to say the non-GAAP quarterly spending will be around RMB 3 billion. I think this outlook is consistent with our prior quarter's statement. Yes, I understand that in terms of SG&A as a percentage of revenue, it's going to decline. But just in terms of the year-over-year growth for SG&A. Shall we expect it to grow more than 22% this year. Yes. I think based on our current forecast, we don't think it will exceed 20% in 2024. As there are no further questions now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's IR team through the contact information provided on our website. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. William Li. William, please go ahead. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining NIO's 2024 Q2 Earnings Call. In the first half of this year, the NIO brand completes the 2024 model year [indiscernible], further enhancing the competitiveness of its NT 2.0 products. In the meantime, as NIO's technologies, products, services and the user community were recognized by more people, its order intake and the delivery continues to grow. NIO's delivery in Q2 reached a quarterly record of 57,373 units, up 143.9%. In China, NIO models had over 40% market share among all BEVs with a transaction price higher than RMB 300,000. 
Since Q3, NIO's product mix has been continuously optimized. In July and August, the delivery was 20,498 and 20,176, respectively. With that, NIO's monthly delivery had been more than 200,000 for 4 consecutive months. The total delivery in Q3 is expected to be between 61,000 and 63,000 units. 
In terms of NIO's financial performance, with continuous cost optimization of core components and the supply chain, the vehicle margin in Q2 increased to 12.2%. As the user community became larger and more vibrant, the second quarter also witnessed that growth in revenues from after-sales and product services. The gross margin of other sales continued to improve. 
Now I would like to share with you the recent highlights of our products, R&D and operations. On Slide 27, NIO hosted NIO in 2024. At the event, we introduced the full-domain operating system, SkyOS and the smart system, [indiscernible]. Moreover, we also announced the successful tape-out of Shenji NX9031, our in-house developed chip for smart driving. As for NAD, NIO continued to increase its system capabilities. In July, the industry's first AEB function based on end-to-end architecture was released with the scenario coverage 6.7x better than traditional AEB. It makes driving safer. 
At NIO Inc., we also introduced the Nio World Model, NWM, the brand-new architecture for smart driving. NAD Arch 2.0 was also released. This is the most advanced end-to-end architecture based on NWM. NIO features and the expenses of NAD Arch 2.0 will be released in the second half of this year. On September 19, our family-centric mass market brand, ONVO is going to celebrate launch of its first model, L60, and the use and delivery will start in late September. With strong confidence in this all-around product, we will spend no effort in ramping up production and fulfilling the market demand. 
For sales and services, as of now, the NIO brand has 106 NIO Houses and 408 NIO Spaces, as well as 351 service centers and 63 delivery centers. The ONVO brand has already opened 105 stores in 55 cities, and we have over 200 stores at the end of the year -- by the year-end. About charging and swapping network so far, NIO has over 2,561 power swap stations worldwide and has provided over 52 million swaps. Besides, NIO has installed over 23,000 power chargers and the destination chargers. Quick and hassle-free recharging is critical for convincing ICE owners to drive the EV. 
On August 20, we hosted the NIO Power Up event, where we announced the plan of Power Up Counties. In the first half of 2025, NIO's charging network will become available in every country in Chinese Mainland. By the end of 2025, the swapping network will become available in more than 2,300 counties in China. To better support this initiative, we also announced the Power Up Partner Plan, and signed an agreement with the first partner. The continuous deployment of the charging and swapping network will help expand the market reach of NIO and ONVO and further drive sales growth.
As for market development, we are accelerating the international expansion. On August 20, NIO's UAE website went live, and in Q4, the products will be launched and delivered in UAE while ensuring controllable investment and efficient operations, we will also actively evaluate opportunities worldwide, introducing products to markets. 
In NEV, quality study released by J.D. Power in early June, NIO models ranked the highest in the respective segments. NIO is also the only NEV company winning top ranking for 6 consecutive years. Ever since its establishment, NIO has been committed to making itself a global benchmark of quality and providing great user experience through life cycle quality management. 
As NIO has been funded for almost 10 years with the market brand strategy and the international business rolled out, as well as the external change, we upgraded the company's value system in July. In the quest of Blue Sky Coming, NIO aspires to shape a sustainable and a bright future and envisions itself as a user enterprise where innovative technology meets experience excellence. 
With NIO brands and the product being launched step-by-step, the fundamental capability and the long-term strategical planning that NIO has been developing will have a great effect. NIO's cumulative R&D investment, sophisticated community operations and the efficient infrastructure deployment will lead to better sales and margin. We look forward to NIO's performance in the second half. 
Thank you for support. With that, I will now turn the call over to Stanley for Q2's financial details. Over to you, Stanley. Thank you, William. Now let me go over our key financial results for the second quarter of 2024. I will refer to RMB only in my discussion today, unless otherwise stated. Our total revenue was RMB 17.4 billion, up 98.9% year-over-year and up 76.1% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from vehicle sales were RMB 15.7 billion, representing an increase of 118.2% year-over-year and an increase of 87.1% quarter-over-quarter. The increase year-over-year was mainly attributed to higher deliveries, partially offset by lower average selling price due to changes in product mix and user rights adjustment since June 2023. The increase quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to higher deliveries. 
Other sales were RMB 1.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.3% year-over-year and an increase of 15.6% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the increase in sales of parts, accessories and after-sales vehicle services and provision of power solutions, which both grow with our user base and partially offset by lower sales of used cars. The increase quarter-over-quarter was mainly attributed to the increase in sales of parts, accessories and after-sales vehicle services, provision of power solutions and other products and the increased revenues from technical R&D services. 
Vehicle margin was 12.2% in this quarter compared with 6.2% for the same period of 2023 and 9.2% for the last quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the decreased material costs and was partially offset by a lower average selling price. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to decreased material costs. Overall, gross margin was 9.7% compared with 1% in the same period of last year and 4.9% in the last quarter.
R&D expenses were RMB 3.2 billion, decreased 3.8% year-over-year and increased 12.4% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to the incremental design at the development costs and increased personnel costs in R&D functions. SG&A expenses were RMB 3.8 billion, increased 31.5% year-over-year and increased 25.4% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by higher personnel costs related to sales functions and increased sales and marketing activities. Loss from operations was RMB 5.2 billion, representing a decrease of 14.2% year-over-year and a decrease of 3.4% quarter-over-quarter.
Net loss was RMB 5 billion, representing a decrease of 16.7% year-over-year and a decrease of 2.7% quarter-over-quarter. As of June 30, 2024, our company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term time deposits in total of RMB 41.6 billion. For more information and the details of our audited second quarter 2024 financial results, please refer to our earnings press release. 
Now this concludes our prepared remarks. I will turn the call over to the operator to facilitate our Q&A session. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Hsiao from Morgan Stanley. I have 2 questions. The first question is about our NIO model, L60. Because L60 started presale in mid-May and since then, I think the model has received tens of thousands of preorders, which is very robust compared to all the NIO launches lately. But how could you also ensure a high conversion rate this time after the launch on September 19? Would the company consider getting more aggressive with the official pricing given the competition? And in the meantime, what client and supply chain preparation the team has done to avoid any potential supply disruption after the delivery starts? That's my first question. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. On August 15, we have witnessed the offline of the very first mass-produced L60, and the Head of Sales of the ONVO brand is actually driving this very first mass-produced car, having a road trip in China, and he has been driving the car for almost 20 days while doing the broadcast on the social media. It has received a lot of attention from the public. Everyday, there are several millions of views of the broadcast by the members. 
In terms of the pre-order intake, it actually is pretty good and has surpassed our expectations. So we are quite confident with the overall competitiveness of this project. Regarding the pricing strategy, while we launched the product in mid-May, we have announced a pre-sale price, which is RMB 290,900, that is around RMB 30,000 triple model-wide. And before the official launch of the product on September 19, we still have some time and room for the final price adjustments and decision. But overall speaking, we will try to strike a balance between the vehicle margin and the price point of the product to find the sweet spot. In general, we will not be very aggressive as we need to realize a reasonable margin for the product. 
Regarding the supply chain security, our target is that by the end of this year, which is in September, we hope that we can realize a supply capacity of 10,000 units. And sometime next year, we will be able to realize a supply capacity of 20,000 units per month. My second question is about the NIO brands, the vehicles on the NIO brand. Because we noticed the monthly sales of models on the NIO brand have stabilized, maybe 20,000 levels in second quarter. So looking forward, would there be any further upside to the vehicle sales and the gross profit margin based on the current product portfolio? Could you share with us that where would be the upside to the volume and the margin of NIO branded vehicles coming from? That's my second question. [Interpreted] Tim, this is Stanley. Thank you for your question. Regarding the vehicle margin of the NIO brand. In the second quarter, we have achieved a vehicle margin of 12.2%. That is mainly because of the efficiency improvements on the supply side and also in the production. As in the past 4 months, we have realized the monthly delivery volume of 20,000 units -- of more than 20,000 units, we also see opportunities for further improvements including the cost optimization of the product as well as to improve the high-margin products in the product mix from the marketing side. With that, we will keep improving the vehicle margin in the following 2 quarters of this year and expect to realize a vehicle margin of around 15% by the end of the year. [Interpreted] And also a comment to add here is that we also see opportunities to improve our delivery volumes month-over-month, yet we will also need to strike a balance between the vehicle delivery volume and the vehicle margin. Both will increase but it will not be in a very drastic manner for either margin or the vehicle volume. As we -- ultimately, we pursue a very good gross profit with our product. So we need to find the sweet spot in between.
And for the much longer time as NIO brand targets, our premium segments priced over RMB 300,000 as we are going to launch NIO products and also do upgrades on the product, we believe that in the Battery Electric Vehicle segment, realizing a monthly volume of around 30,000 to 40,000 units is a reasonable target in the volume. 
So all sum up, for the NIO brand, our long-term operational target is to realize a monthly volume of 40,000 units and a vehicle margin of 25%. 
As for the ONVO brand, it faces a much larger market with a total [car park] of more than 8 million. In that case, leveraging our Battery as a Service as well as our well-established charging and swapping network, we believe that ONVO's products will be competitive even against the competition with [indiscernible] and other best models. So for ONVO products, they do have higher potential or bigger potential for a higher sales volume month-over-month. And for the longer term, our operational target for ONVO products will be 15% -- more than 15% for the vehicle margin. And we believe that it's also a reasonable target. Your next question comes from Bin Wang from Deutsche Bank. Okay. My first question is also about ONVO L60. Previously, you mentioned that this year, your volume target is about 20,000 units. Given the strong order, do you still maintain such a volume target? And if you get back down by mass because we are not exactly in the end of this month, so what's the progress for October, November, December? So that is my first question. 
And second question is about the expense, SG&A expense. It seems that expenses keep increasing, what's your target for this quarterly SG&A expense? Do you have guidance for each quarter in the upcoming second half? [Interpreted] I will take the first question. This is William. Regarding the ONVO L60, we will start the delivery of the products from late September, but it will take some time for us to ramp up the production and supply of the NIO product. So most of our deliveries this year will happen in Q4. We will start delivery from September, but not in a very significant volume. And towards the end of the year, we hope that our monthly delivery will be around 10,000 units for the month of December. In terms of the supply side, as the car is equipped with many new technologies, it will also take some time for the supply side to ramp up their production. [Interpreted] This is Stanley. I will take the second question. Regarding expenses, there are 2 categories. The first is R&D expenses. We will still keep the similar R&D investment pace and intensity on a quarterly basis. So roughly on the non-GAAP basis, it will be around RMB 3 billion every quarter, but there will also be fluctuations or slight differences from quarter-to-quarter as they are relevant to our actual R&D activities conducted.
And regarding the second category, SG&A expenses. As we have mentioned that in late Q3, we will start the delivery of L60. With that, there will be increase in our SG&A expenses. But as we ramp up the delivery volume of the project, we also think that we will keep optimizing the percentage of the SG&A expenses against the overall sales revenue from L60. Your next question comes from Tina Hou from Goldman Sachs. So my first question is also regarding ONVO L60. So just wondering at let's say, 10,000 volume in December this year and 20,000 volume next year, what kind of gross margin should be reasonable for this model? Also, as we are ramping up to higher and higher volume, what is our capacity expansion plan and also CapEx plan for 2025 and maybe 2026? Should we expect CapEx to become higher versus 2024? So that's the first question.
The second question is also regarding the sales and marketing expense. So we had over 30% SG&A expense growth in the second quarter. Wondering, could you give more details on the sub items, which is the one that's growing the fastest? And also, is any of the sales policy recorded in the SG&A expense? Yes. So that's my second question. [Interpreted] Thank you for your question. This is William. I will take your first question. Regarding L60, when its overall production volume reaches a reasonable and expected targets, we believe that it will naturally realize a 15% vehicle margin. Of course, against the fierce competition, we have also reserved some room for the variable marketing of the product so that we will be more flexible in the competition. Yet overall speaking, as the product itself is designed for efficiency and cost, 15% vehicle margin is a reasonable target for this model as we actually managed to realize a good balance between the technology advancement and the cost competitiveness.
Regarding the capacity preparation, we are having the mid- and long-term planning for our production capacity in 2025 and '26. As of now, we already have 2 factories in operation, and F2 have already started to upgrade to double shifts to support the production of L60. In late September or early October, the upgrade to 2 shifts will be completed in F2. And in the meantime, we are also planning our third factory. And around Q3 next year, the third factory will be ready to produce the products, which means that by Q3 next year, we will have 3 factories in operations and it will be sufficient to support our production.
Overall speaking, we don't think production capacity will be a bottleneck for us, especially it will not be a long-term bottleneck for us. Here in China, the production capacity and capabilities of vehicles and parts are quite competent. Maybe some companies will face short-term disturbance in their capacity and the supply, yet for long term, it will not be a bottleneck. Especially last year, we have obtained independent manufacturing qualification. This has also laid a foundation for our long-term stable capacity. [Interpreted] This is Stanley. I will take your second question. Regarding the CapEx, according to the status quo of the company, we are making prudent control in the management of the pace of our investment and expenses. Especially starting last year, we have already started such management by postponing certain projects or even canceling some projects. So overall speaking, the R&D or the CapEx in the year of 2024 will be significantly lower than that in 2023. As for 2025, as we haven't started budgeting for the next year, we don't have a clear picture over that, but we believe that the overall expense intensity will be similar to this year.
As for the increase in the SG&A expenses in Q2, it's mainly contributed to 2 reasons. The first is that in Q1, we delivered around 30,000 units and in Q2, we delivered a total of more than 57,000 units. The increase of our sales volume naturally drove up the staff cost mainly because the team site has grown and also the incentives for the sales force has increased as well. And the second reason is that in the first half of this year, we have launched our model year specifics and many of the NIO products were launched in around April -- around May and -- around March and April. In that case, we have also started a series of communications and marketing campaigns relevant to our model year products that has also increased the development expenses from Q1. Can I have a very quick follow-up? So in terms of ONVO store, do you have the average store rental cost versus NIO store? And also, how many employees do you plan to deploy in an ONVO store versus that of a NIO store? [Interpreted] Regarding the opening of ONVO stores, we actually require the team to open up the stores in a quick and efficient manner. So in terms of the CapEx as well as the rent of a single ONVO store, it is significantly lower than that of a NIO store. But we don't have the specific numbers for comparison as the actual expenses may be quite different depending on the locations and the type of the store. But overall, the expense is lower -- significantly lower than that of NIO.
And in terms of the renovation fee for each of the ONVO store, we actually have a very strict requirement. For the ONVO -- for the existing 100 ONVO stores we have just opened, for each store, the renovation fee was no more than RMB 1 million. And for the following 100 stores we are going to open by the end of the year, we will have even more strict requirement on renovation. With that, we will be able to make full use of the existing resources and to renovate the store in a more efficient manner. In terms of the team size for each of the stores, it depends on the actual number of orders and deliveries. We plan for each store in each city. But in general, we will make sure that the team is also set up in the most efficient and compact way. Your next question comes from Yuqian Ding from HSBC. Yuqian here. I've got 2 questions. First is about [indiscernible] driving progress and second is about market and competition dynamics.
First question, could you share the NIO NOP progress? Especially, could you break down in terms of the consumer take rate, our disengagement rate, scenario coverage, the regional expansion, these aspects.
And the second question is to ask against the backdrop of -- in the premium EV segment, there's a couple of new models coming, especially in the coming months until the end of the year. And also, we noticed the high-tier city versus the low-tier city, the consumer consumption is sliding in general and more so than the low-tier city. So could you help us to get comfortable and conviction on NIO and ONVO's portfolio product technology and service expansion could counter these macro headwinds and still book growth quarter-on-quarter perspective, maybe in an aspect of channel order momentum and the latest consumer feedback? [Interpreted] Thank you for your question. We also noticed the fierce competition in the area of smart driving, yet we are also confident that NIO is among the top players in this area. Regarding NOP+, it is now being used by more than 300,000 users as it is now offered as a standard feature on our NT 2.0 product. In the meantime, the cumulative knowledge driven with NOP and NOP+ has reached -- has surpassed 1.1 billion kilometers. So in terms of the user base as well as the total mileage driven with the functionality, we are also a top player in China.
Regarding the technology road map. Right now, inside of the industry, many players are converging their technology solutions and the roadmap into end-to-end model, be it Tesla or other players in China. For NIO, we are also working on our end-to-end model, and we have already released our first end-to-end based feature that is end-to-end AEB. Its performance has been significantly improved than the traditional AEB functionality as its scenario coverage is 6.7x better than the traditional AEB.
And in the meantime, at the NIO Inc., we have also released our end-to-end architecture based on the NIO World Model because end-to-end is an architecture, but its foundation technology is also very important, and we are the first company to develop and announce such world model and the end-to-end architecture based on the model. We have also released the NAD Arch 2.0. So the end-to-end model will be based on the NIO -- the end-to-end architecture will be based on the NIO World Model where you can see that the NIO World Model is developed with the end-to-end architecture solution.
Overall speaking, we believe that we are still leading the block in terms of the smart driving technologies. We have already tested the latest functionality on NAD Arch 2.0 at the small scale, and its performance is pretty impressive. Overall speaking, with World Model and end-to-end architecture, we will be able to realize quicker functionality iteration, better experience at a lower cost.
In terms of the ONVO brand, its product will come with a single [range] with pure vision technology solution. But even with that, it has realized a very good performance in the urban driving scenario. The other day, I have tested the functionality in Shanghai and it's also pretty good. So overall speaking, we believe that -- and we also saw facts that the smart driving functionalities will help users improve the safety of driving. In terms of the actual usability of the functionality, we will also keep working on that.
Regarding your second question, we also understand the intensity of the market competition, and this is not the first time for us to face such fierce competition, yet the NIO brand has been realizing a pretty stable market share in the premium segment for years. This is mainly because we have a diversified and rich product portfolio to offer for the premium segment. We have ET5, 5T, ES6, EC6, ET7, ES7, plus ES8. So it's a pretty wide range of a product offering that will be enough to cover many product segments. And many of these products are also leading the sales volume in their respective BEV product segment. Not to mention that for some niche products like ET5T, EC7 or EC6, in their respective segment, their volume is even higher than some of the ICE competitors.
So overall speaking, we have made a quite successful product portfolio and offering strategy. Plus, we also have other advantages such as charging and the swapping network, leading technologies, good product experience, service and the user community. This has further enhanced and solidified our foothold in the premium segment. Of course, in the meantime, we also hope that more players can also come into this segment so that we can work with them together to enlarge the size of this premium segment, premium BEV segment.
In the meantime, for the entire NIO company, we actually have a pretty clear and straightforward strategy for the continuous business growth. First is by wider price range. From next year, we are going to have 3 brands in the markets. With that, our price range -- the price range that can be covered by these 3 brands will be as wide -- will be pretty wide, ranging from RMB 140,000 all the way to RMB 800,000. And with Battery-as-a-Service, the price range will be from RMB 100,000 to RMB 700,000, which will be a very strong competition to the ICE costs in the respective segments. With 3 brands with a wide price range, we will be able to reach a broader market than many of our other competitors.
The second approach is via our products, wide product range. We have 3 brands. We also have a very diversified product portfolio of each brand. In that case, we will be able to cover a pretty comprehensive product segment with clear differentiation between each brand.
And the third approach is through the markets and the regional coverage. Right now, we are expanding our point of sales into the lower-tier cities. Especially for NIO, at the moment, most of our sales are in the first- and second-tier cities. So such coverage expansion is also very important. We have also announced other plants like the County Power Up plan where we will expand our charging and swapping network to the counties at all levels. With that, it will help us to further enhance the reach of all 3 brands. Plus we also have the business development plan for the overseas market.
So overall speaking, for the long-term growth and the development, we have a clear road map, that is by a wide price range, wide product range and also broader regional coverage. Your next question comes from Paul Gong from UBS. Two questions here. The first one is regarding the flagship sedan, ET9. I think it was announced to schedule for launch in Q1 next year. Is that still on schedule? And can you give some updates regarding this model in terms of the position in new technology adoption as well as the targets volume outlook? Yes.
The second question is regarding the overseas expansion. You are going to open the store in UAE and start delivering there. Is that a signal of the change of direction as a result of the EU tariff that you are reaching the direction from Europe into Middle East. Also, one of your peers has nowadays been delivering over 10% of their volume into the overseas markets. Do you think this serves as a benchmark for your overseas expansion over the next 1 or 2 years? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding the further question on the ET9, we're still proceeding the ET9 launch preparation according to the plan and we haven't made any changes on [indiscernible] of this product. But in the meantime, as you know that the ET9 is equipped with many new technologies, including steer-by-wire, fully active suspension, in-house developed chip as well as SkyOS, so we will need to spare no effort in making sure and preparing for the successful launch of this product next year.
Regarding your second question on our international expansion, we haven't changed our direction. Yes, because of the tariffs in Europe, now selling or exporting costs from China to Europe becomes more expensive. So we will focus on the existing 5 European markets that we have already started. We also know that to establish NIO, such a premium brand in the European market, will also take a longer time and we are very patient with that. But in the meantime, it doesn't mean that we have stopped our activities there. Earlier this year, we have just opened our NIO house in Amsterdam, and we are still installing and deploying our power swap stations in Europe. So we will still keep the same plan.
In terms of the market entry into UAE, as you may know that last year, we have received USD 3 billion strategic investment from the Abu Dhabi government. And then the market entry into UAE is part of the plan. With that, we will work with our strategic partners in UAE to offer our products and services to the local market.
Starting next year, a big difference is that we not only have NIO brand and products, but also products from ONVO, which are more suitable for the global market. With that, we will be actually more active with our international expansion. But in the meantime, we will also need to keep a good balance between our investment scale and the efficiency to make sure that we enter into the global market in a smarter and more efficient way. Your next question comes from Ming-Hsun Lee from Bank of America. William and Stanley, I also have 2 questions. So my first question is more related to the overall macro. So in your view, what is the potential growth rate for the China EV market in the next few years? Because I think recently, some investors expect that the EV penetration will still be down because right now, the EV penetration is already very high. So just in your view, what is the EV penetration in the next 3 years? Yes. That's my first question.
And my second question is regarding the Firefly pipeline. So right now, will you launch 1 or 2 models in 2025 for Firefly? That's my 2 questions. [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. If you look at the overall passenger vehicle market, in the first half of this year, it has increased by around 3.6%. For the longer term, actually, if you look at the total PV population in China, it is as big as 20 million to 30 million units. So it's already a very significant amount. Definitely, it will keep growing, but probably not a very -- not at a very significant growth rate. And it's even normal for the PV segment or PV market to suffer slight decrease. But even with that, the Chinese market will still be the largest passenger vehicle market in the world.
In terms of the penetration rate of the NIO energy vehicle, it has already surpassed 50%. And I think that it will continue to increase and at an even faster manner because for the replacement of the ICE cost, [indiscernible], it will be much faster once it has surpassed this 50% keeping point. We can take Norway as a reference for example. It actually grew at 50% penetration rate at first, and then it has quickly increased to 80% and 90%. So similarly for China, I believe that in 2 to 3 years, the penetration rate of NIO energy vehicles among new vehicle sales will surpass 80%.
If we look at the ICE cars in China, actually they have entered into an unsustainable cycle or a vicious cycle because many ICE brands have to cut their prices to keep their market share. Be it premium brands or mass market brands, be it brands from China or from other countries, many of these ICE costs are having a price flushed for the sake of market share. But as they cut prices, it also hurts the profit and interest of their dealers, hurts the image of the brand as well as the residual value of their products. With that, it is even more difficult for them to keep a very strong market share in their segments. So their -- the decline of their market share is even faster than it should be.
For the recent years, we have already witnessed the significant decline of the market shares of the Korean brands like Hyundai, Kia, including Ford and General Motors. And for the recent years, Japanese brands like Toyota, Honda and Nissan are also entering the same space. So in general, we believe that the ICE costs from these joint venture brands will face quite difficulties in the future competition. And when they lose some market share, they normally lose market shares to other NIO energy vehicle brands, including brands from China and Europe. So in that regard, I believe that the penetration rate of the NIO energy vehicle will grow at a pretty quick pace, even faster than we expected.
And regarding your second question, yes, we are going to deliver the product from Firefly from 2025. We are in smooth progress with our product preparation. Your next question comes from Jing Chang from CICC. I have 2 questions. The first is in regard to our NIO operating system, SkyOS, which has been released in July. So it has shown very comprehensive and invest our software self-development ability. So can you just introduce -- and ask more details what are the technical challenges we have faced and work advantages and also the improvement of our product can be brought by the NIO system? So this is the first question.
The second is with regard to the other income, gross profit margin. We have seen the second quarter, the gross profit margin has improved significantly. So how to understand these major drivers? And also, what's our forecast for the trend and the continuity of the margin improvement in the future? So also with our growth of our sales volume, can we see that our -- especially charging and battery swap business, can turn to profit in future? [Interpreted] Thank you for the question. Regarding SkyOS, it's the world's first full-domain vehicle operating system. That is the special thing with SkyOS, which is also the difficulty or the challenge we have faced when developing the SkyOS, because when it comes to the era of the smart electric vehicles, we cannot use the fragmented operating systems to manage the electric architecture of the car anymore.
With that, we have developed the SkyOS. It comes at 3 levels. At the bottom, we have the SkyOS-H, that is the hypervisor. And in the middle, we have 4 kernels for the SkyOS. And on the top, we have SkyOS middleware. So it's a very comprehensive solution we have developed. We've used the 4 years with 20,000 [indiscernible] with this great work.
In terms of its benefit, the SkyOS is definitely making the car safer and more secure. It also makes the system stable and it also help us to realize more efficient R&D process and iteration process. It also helps us solve the problems faced by the smart electric vehicles, like huge data throughput, domain -- cost domain fusion and also the latency along the communications. Because we know that it's impossible to realize such benefit by simply working on the application and the adaptation, we need to do something at the foundational level, and we are very happy that we have made it happen. The SkyOS will be applied to our brands, including NIO, ONVO and Firefly. We can say that SkyOS is a software cornerstone for our future products and development.
Regarding the revenues, where the loss on other sales in Q2, we have significantly narrowed the losses on other sales in Q2. It's mainly because of the 2 reasons. I think in Q2, we have improved or increased our user deliveries. With that -- well actually, there are 2 reasons. The first is that we have improved the profitability and the efficiency of our aftermarket source. Earlier this year, on February 20, we have released the 2024 [indiscernible] service policy. With the new policy, our after-sales services become more efficient and also more profitable.
And secondly, we have also decoupled the lifetime NIO power swap from the sales of the vehicles. With that, more and more users, especially NIO users have to pay for the power swap services. This has also helped us improve the revenues and the margin on the power swap related services. With that, we have significantly narrowed the losses on the other sales. And we believe that in the future, as we continue to grow the total user base and the sales volume, especially with the launch and delivery of the ONVO products, the profitability of the other sales will also become stronger, and we look forward to the breakeven or even the profit from this part.
And in terms of the profitability of the power swap service or in general power swap stations, if we look at the single swap station, if it can offer more than 60 power swaps per day, it itself will -- and in the meantime, if we charge all the power swap services at the same level for the supercharging, then the single station will become breakeven. And right now, in China, we have more than 2,500 power swap stations and on average, each station can complete around 30 to 40 swaps per day. So from 30 to 40 to 60, it's not a long way to go for us to make the power swap station breakeven.
But in the meantime, we still suffer the loss on the power swap business. It's mainly because of 2 reasons. The first is that at the early stage for the early adopters of the NIO products, we have offered free lifetime power swaps to many of these users, which has actually worsened the burden on the cost of the power swap stations and the power swap services. And secondly, as we roll out our business and the network, we also came to realize that the network effect of the power swap station actually has a very significant meaning to the boost of the sales volume. In that case, we are more active in installing power swap stations, even ahead of the actual need. So this swap stations deployed in advance also bring additional losses or burden to the business.
So in general, if we look at the power swap station itself, it's not far away from breakeven and profitability, yet considering its actual contribution to the sales volume, we have decided to deploy many stations in advance, and this has caused the loss on the business. As there are no further questions now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact NIO's IR team through the contact information on our website. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect the line. Thank you.
