At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Magen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's investor relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017.
In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Leading off with the December quarter highlights, KLA-Tencor reported another record quarter, delivering new quarterly highs in shipments, revenues, gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share in the period. Full year results for calendar 2017 also set records in each of these metrics as well as in free cash flow generation. These outstanding results demonstrate the dedication that runs throughout our organization to serving our customers and delivering results to our stockholders as well as the long-term value generated and successful execution of the company's strategic objectives.
I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the dynamics underlying our record performance and the momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today. I will begin with the orders for our optical inspection products, including both patterned and un-patterned wafer inspection, which grew 18% in calendar 2017, following 11% growth in 2016. Total optical inspection revenue grew to record levels for the second consecutive year in 2017.
The same expansion we are experiencing in these core markets for KLA-Tencor are partially driven by strong customer acceptance of three of our major pattern inspection systems. Gen 5, our flagship broadband plasma inspection platform, is being deployed by customers across all segments and is solving their most critical defect in yield challenges. The ramp of Gen 5 is performing to our expectations and we are seeing an increasing number of layers implemented for production, for advanced logic and memory devices.
In addition, the Gen 4 broadband plasma inspection platform and the Puma laser scanning platforms continue to provide the most cost effective wafer inspection performance to meet current yield and quality production requirements. Additionally, our un-patterned or bare wafer inspection and metrology products are also experiencing record demand today. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new process control capability to meet strong wafer demand, while IC customers are adding new bear wafer products to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in a greater number of layers for advanced technologies.
Next, KLA-Tencor is playing an enabling role in bringing EUV lithography technology to market, by collaborating with every EUV customer to accelerate technology development and yield learning for critical wafer and mask inspection applications. The process control applications inherent to EUV mainly lie in mask manufacturing and requalification, resist qualification and scanner control.
These along with the unique patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV sourced technology present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive suite of product technologies in the industry. We are already generating meaningful revenue from early adoption of EUV and this new technology promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and as the market leader for KLA.
And finally growth in China, investment in the Chinese semiconductor industry is currently driving an inflection in demand for the global wafer fab equipment market. And the China build out is expected to be a major factor underlying industry growth for years to come. As the leader in process control, KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong, both in terms of customer share and an adoption. Orders from native Chinese customers nearly tripled in 2017 and this strong momentum is expected to continue into 2018.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2017 results demonstrate the company's innovation and technology leadership. We are operating from a position of strength, as we embark on another year of expected growth and strong stockholder returns. Looking ahead to 2018, given our record backlog levels and the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today, revenue growth is expected to be in the high single digits for the year and is positioned to outperform overall WFE industry growth.
As always, KLA-Tencor's strong relative performance will be fueled by our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' success and our continued focus on operations execution. The stage is set to build on the momentum and record performance delivered in calendar 2017 and deliver what we expect to be another exciting year of growth in 2018.
I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution in the December quarter and in calendar 2017. Shipments, revenues, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and achieved new records in both the December quarter and for the calendar year.
Revenue in the quarter was 976 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97 and would have been $1.83 at the guided tax rate of 18% for the quarter. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.86 in December, largely resulting from a charge taken in the quarter for the transition tax on historical cumulative earnings outside of the US and tax asset and liabilities revaluation related to the new tax law. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.
Now, turning to highlights of the December quarter, demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were 1.041 billion in December, up 7% sequentially and finishing above the guided range for the quarter as customer pull for tool deliveries across the product portfolio drove upside to the quarter. Looking forward, we are modeling March quarter shipments to be in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion. Our expectation is for shipment levels for the first half of calendar '18 to be roughly flat compared to the second half of 2017 and with low to mid single digit have to have growth planned in the second half of the calendar year.
For the full year, shipments are expected to grow in the high single digits compared with 2017. Memory was 71% of shipments and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the March quarter with memory shipments expected to be approximately 70% of the quarter total. Foundry was 20% of shipments in December, as expected and Foundry is forecasted to be about 15% of shipments in March. Logic was 9% of shipments in the December quarter and is currently forecasted to be 15% in March.
In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments; patterning was 30%. Patterning includes orders for reticle inspection. Service was 21% and non-semi was approximately 2%.
I'll turn now to further details of the income statement. As I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 976 million in December. We expect revenue to be in the range of 970 million to 1.03 billion in the March quarter. In terms of half to half expectations for 2018, we are currently modeling revenue in the second half of the year to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus the first half of the calendar year.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, a new record for the company and above the guided range of 63% to 64%, largely as a result of a stronger than modeled product mix. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% in the March quarter. In the earnings call last October, we provided gross margin expectations of 63% to 64% for calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for revenue growth, customer acceptance of key products, cost management and execution and the mix of system business in the year. Looking ahead, we believe our gross margins will likely bias towards the higher end of this guided range in 2018.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses were 262 million in Q4, up as expected compared with the September quarter due to expenses related to advanced technology development programs for EUV lithography. Non-GAAP operating margin was flat compared to Q3 at 37.7%. We are currently sizing operating expense levels to be approximately 255 million in the March quarter. Beyond that, our outlook is for quarterly operating expenses to be in the $260 million range throughout calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for high single digit revenue growth for the year and consistent with our published business model.
Given the strong gross margin profile I referenced, we should continue to deliver operating margins at the higher - or the upper end or above this model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the quarter, resulting from the required true-up of our tax rate estimate for fiscal year '18, ending in June due to the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1. Included in the GAAP results is an estimated charge of approximately 442 million associated with the new tax law passed by Congress and signed by the President in late December.
The vast majority of the charge is related to the transition tax for the accumulative historical earnings the company earned outside of the US. In addition, we also incurred a charge related to revaluing our deferred tax assets based on the lower US tax rate. This tax charge will be adjusted over the next few quarters as additional financial information and regulatory guidance and interpretation becomes available.
In terms of the expected impact of the new tax law on KLA-Tencor, our preliminary analysis indicate the changes in the tax law will be beneficial to the company and to our stockholders, as the annual ongoing US tax liability for the company will be meaningfully lower. Furthermore, the new territorial tax system will enable us additional flexibility to repatriate future foreign earnings and allow access to cash to productively invest in the business, pursue compelling strategic growth opportunities and return cash to stockholders without any additional US tax liability.
Based on our initial modeling, we expect the overall worldwide tax planning rate of 20% provided last October, based on the expected mix of business in 2018 to decrease by approximately 500 basis points and allow access to all free cash flow generated, irrespective of geographical IP ownership or manufacturing location. As a result, going forward, the new recommended tax rate for modeling purposes is 15%.
Finally, net income for the December quarter was 309 million and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.76 billion, a decrease of approximately 298 million compared with the September quarter, primarily due to repayment and maturity of 250 million in public bonds and a net reduction of 40 million in bank loans. Cash from operations was 129 million in the quarter and free cash flow was 116 million. For the full year in 2017, free cash flow was 1.14 billion. Consistent with our proactive track record of returning cash to stockholders, we believe that unallocated free cash flow is valued only when it is productively deployed. Going forward, the new tax environment will afford the company additional flexibility to continue to optimize this fundamental aspect of the company's strategy. We will have more to say on this topic in the coming weeks.
In December, we paid an aggregate of 92.6 million regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $40 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. The company has approximately 4.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in December reflect our market leadership and our industry leading business model. This coupled with ending total backlog of approximately 1.9 billion position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '18. Current forecasts are for the WFE market to grow mid-single digits in 2018. Against this industry setting, we are modeling the company revenue to grow in the high single digits in the year, stronger than the broader market and with operating performance expected at the high end of the range of these revenue levels in our target model.
So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is, shipments in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion; revenue between 970 million and 1.03 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.09 per share with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.84 to $2.08 per share.
This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Thank you. Bren. And is always, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per firm and a brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Okay. Magen, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the overall strategy for capital deployment. Can you just talk about how are you thinking about [indiscernible]. And if I think about your prior commentary, you've always said that if it's a tax reform, you would think about giving back more to the shareholders. So if you can just comment on that, that would be really helpful. Sure, Farhan. It's Bren. Thanks for the question. It's certainly an exciting time for the company and I think given our historical track record around how we think about deploying cash in the business, either investing in the business or how we look at M&A opportunities or certainly returns to shareholders, it's an opportunity that adds additional flexibility to what we can do going forward. As I said in the prepared remarks, we don't have any update today, although, we do expect to have more to say on the topic in the coming weeks. I would say philosophically, our position is no different.
We have a great business, a strong business model. It's not capital intensive and so the free cash flow margin is pretty strong. And so, we have the ability to return, I think, a fair amount of cash to shareholders, if that is where our process takes us. We're not compelled at this point to do any significant de-levering. We've been doing that over the course of the year. We have the leverage in the right place for the company.
And so going forward, I think we have to look at the alternatives and make those calls. Our feelings haven't changed. We're going to grow the dividend certainly over time, consistent with the growth rate in cash flow. And, or the earnings of the company and we're going to target a payout ratio that's somewhere in the through cycle 40% to 50%. So I think that part of the strategy is well understood. And as far as the cash reserves on the balance sheet, we'll have more to say about that coming in the next few weeks. And then, in regards to my second question, can you just talk about the e-beam versus optical. There is a concern in the market that ASML is ramping their holistic lithography. That can be a threat to your business. Can you just, at a high level, talk about how do you see that as a competitor to the optical inspection technology? Sure. We've seen, as you know Farhan, the Gen 5 has really been the tool we've been deploying for leading edge really across the board with our customers in terms of advanced memory, both in NAND, but also in DRAM, but also in advanced logic and we've seen good adoption of that. As we said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see development being - leveraging the capabilities of Gen 5 and that product has a lot of legs.
As you know, that was recently introduced and there's quite a roadmap for that. So, customers definitely want the coverage capable, only really delivered by Gen 5 and they want to have continue to be able to leverage optical, just the price performance relative to e-beam. There is a place for e-beam, there's been a place for e-beam for many years and we suspect that will continue. But on a relative basis, we had a record year in optical wafer inspection in 2017 and we expect that to continue in 2018. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. We're hearing that in addition to using Gen 5 for print check and also for early defect learning for EUV based technologies that some of your customers may be actually looking to use Gen 5 for high volume production, even this year before EUR, just given some of the yield challenges associated with some of these next generation manufacturing technologies. Is it something that you guys are actually seeing and is this just with your foundry and logic customers or is this also across some of your memory customers? Harlan, great question. As is typical, when we introduce a new tool, depending on the particular user and their ability to understand the value and to leverage in, some of the early users tend to deploy first in production. We are seeing it in production on some layers. There are typically the more critical layers where it provides a pronounced benefit from capabilities they had before. We have had recent customer experience where they're now able to detect inline defects that they before could only see end of line, as they were missed by prior optical tools and also not detectable by e-beam. So those tools are being deployed in line. It really is in both logic and memory structures, perhaps a little more surprising with some of the memory applications that we've seen. So we're encouraged by those signs and we fully expect that to continue. Harlan, it's Bren. The only thing I'll add is, is that Gen 5, the reception to Gen 5 from a value perspective has been really strong with the customer base over the last 12 to 18 months or so. And as we look at 2018, part of the company's year-to-year performance is driven by a bigger contribution from that product line. So, you mentioned print checks. Certainly, there's a lot of value that's demonstrated there. Defect discovery is still the place where it competes and where we saw the growth there where it has made significant inroads against the e-beam opportunities for the reasons Rick talked about earlier. But then also in some of these really high end opportunities in early production and difficult layers, so really across all segments, we're pretty confident with what we're seeing there and excited to get a higher level adoption of this product as we move forward over the course of the year. And then on EUV mask inspection, as EUV starts to ramp here, what's the traction been like with the Teron platform in conjunction with 5 for print check, first question. And then more importantly, for kind of next generation high volume EUV mask inspection, can you guys just give us an update on your multi-beam mask inspection platform. What's been the early feedback from your lead alpha customers here? Sure. The Teron isn't really used for print check, it's used for the mask development. So - and that's, we're seeing great demand for that across a number of players, simply because of the increased activity in terms of EUV mask production. So that's really the workhorse right now for the industry in terms of, for the, [indiscernible]. We have had a lot of interest in multi-beam. I do think customers, as they contemplate high volume, they are going to work through, I think, a couple of scenarios.
The most likely is, there will be some level of e-bean inspection and there'll be print check inspection and the print check, we're well suited to support that with the Gen 5 platform and there's a lot of interest as I said in the multi-beam and we've got a heavy customer engagements on that front. But as we said, when we first started discussing that tool, that's still a ways out, I think that we will intercept the market when it's needed in terms of volume. Right now, it's really people preparing for volume down the road. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess first question, when I think about your WFE guide and I compare it to Lam's, you're coming in a little bit lighter and it sounds like DRAM was one of the principal drivers of the uplift at least for them. So I guess a question off of that which is, are you contemplating upside from DRAM within your model here in calendar '18, particularly as you think about some of the more logic related structures that are being adopted, as we move to 18-nanometer, would love to hear your thoughts on that front. Yes. C.J., I don't think we're that far off where Lam is, we're talking about, at the beginning of the year in a few percentage points. So there's a margin for error on this that probably puts this all in about the same place. I think fundamentally, the way they talk about segments from what I understand was, around memory, with DRAM strength, NAND flash strength in the year. We think we see a little bit more logic strength at least around our business. And, foundry looks like it'll be down some.
So add it all up, you end up in this mid 5%, 7% type single digit growth rates. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in DRAM in terms of adoption from a process control intensity perspective. You have more logic in the devices, you also have the dynamics that are happening in China that are good for process control adoption intensity as well. So I think one of the good - really strong stories about the company right now, given the improvements we've seen in intensity is to have a year that is this strong around memory and have the company in a position to perform at least in line with the market and at least as the way we wanted, perhaps a little bit better. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing across all segments and I think there's opportunities for us to solve unique problems, given the technology transitions that are in front of us. And I guess as my follow up, as you think about second half rise in shipment and I guess I'm making the assumption, correct me if I'm wrong that logic foundry will be greater percentage there, which I would think would deliver upside to gross margin. So should we be contemplating an uplift to gross margins through the year for you guys. So I think the way you're modeling it in terms of the segment mix half to half is right. I mean, it's still pretty strong memory through the course of the year, but foundry logic does pick up in to the second half. I think, one of the wildcards in the year is the order profile into the December quarter and in that time frame is pretty strong around foundry. So depending on when those orders actually materialize, that there's a pull in, does that create opportunity at the end of the year to ship those tools or not. Right now, we haven't slotted the way that we do with these four orders in Q4.
So around gross margins, our gross margin profile across the different segments is not any different. The way that the company delivers value - we share value with customers, the ROI is understood, the pricing is very consistent and so sometimes mix of products changes a little bit, but I'm modeling gross margin consistent with the prepared remarks, the bias to the higher end of the range of 63% to 64% that I mentioned. And over the course of the year, movement within the quarters will be driven largely by some smaller product mix issues here and there, but I expect most quarters to be operating in and around the range I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Just a fall question on China. I think some of your peers is talking kind of increased spending from the domestic memory chip makers now and I think historically an investor base be that that will be very possible for KLA. I'm just curious where do we stand on that? Do you have any update in terms of the cadence of that spending? Are we seeing a strong pickup this year or it's really more like '19. Yes. So it's been a good segment of business for us. China, as a region, as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw a tripling of native China bookings in calendar '17 versus calendar '16. Those orders tend to come with longer lead times, given the nature of not just new fabs, but also new fabs and new locations. So there's always infrastructure and other requirements that are part of the equation to get something up and running. As we look at calendar '18, I don't see any change in momentum.
I think the mix shifts a little bit, where it was more 50-50 memory foundry in calendar '17. Again, this is from an order perspective, calendar '18 seems a little bit more foundry heavy. But the contribution roughly in the same in the same range. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and as these projects come up to speed and they start to make progress, I think that's going to influence the timing of the next round or next phases of investment that happen over the coming years. But what's in front of us looks pretty good. Just to be really clear, so you're basically not kind of low single digit growth does not factor in comp growth in China and it sounds like you expect a kind of similar level, but a mix shift there. Is that correct? You know what, we'll ship more in '17 than we shipped in '16. My commentary was focused on the order mix. So yeah, there's more contribution from China in terms of shipment and revenue, native China in the calendar '18 numbers than there was in calendar '17. And then my follow-up question is on the pattern wafer inspection market, it's really strong right now, but historically the business tend to be more, they go bigger cycle. Is there anything structurally changed for that market that give you confident that demand is sustainable? A couple of things have. I think, it is true first of all that those businesses happen to be very strong when there is a reinvestment cycle, but there's a couple of - and to new technology and that can be driven by a couple of things, but one of the - volume of course drives and the other one is when there are new specs relative to, particularly based on design rules. The other thing we're seeing is the flatness market growing, an acquisition we did years ago is doing very well inside the bare wafer market to measure wafer flatness and that's being driven a lot by additional requirements, driven in part by 3D NAND. And so we're seeing new specs, driving new tool purchases in addition to the traditional drivers of volume and sensitivity. Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. I just had one question for you, Rick. It just seems like as demand for AI and server/ high performance computing hardware inflects the size of the silicon that powers that functionality is also growing at a fairly tremendous rate. Nvidia's got a V100 GPU that they say has north of 20 billion transistors. And so the byproduct of that is that you've got these very high performance CPEs and GPEs, but the yields are not great. And it would seem like the implication here is that demand for top tier process control equipment should be stronger benefit from this trend and I was hoping you could talk about that. Sure. Yes, absolutely. One of the main drivers is the push for AI and also the high performance computing just in general as a category and we are seeing and it plays really on a couple of places for us. One, it drives additional designs, which drives mask, which drives our mask business. So we are seeing benefit. And then in the fab, the additional complexity of those very advanced chips drives everything about complexity, including defectivity requirements because a larger die and also the metrology requirements associated with it. So it is a positive inflection for us overall and it is going to be a multiple foundries as well, not just in one. So there are other players in that. So we expect that to be something that continues to drive the need for process control as we go forward. Is it fair to say that this trend, as it accelerates is good for your blended ASPs and then consequently your gross margins over time. Well, certainly the percentage of tooling as Bren mentioned, we're not really customer dependent on gross margin as we are mix, but as the process gets more complex, the mix of customer use case tends to go toward the more advanced tools. So sure, we would see a benefit in terms of our overall profitability and business level based on advanced devices of any kind, pushing demand forward. So yes, absolutely it's a driver for us. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Rick, in terms of memory capital intensity, you've talked about in the past how 3-D NAND and a lot of the manufacturing challenges there has helped increase process control intensity. I know, we're at the early ramp of the new 64-layer devices that we're seeing in the marketplace, but as we go to 96 and 128, are the increases in layer going to continue to help in capital intensity or have we kind of just reached maybe a leveling at this time? I think you said you've gain one or two percentage process control intensity points with the 3-D transition. How do you look at it as we go to more layers? Great question and the answer is there is more opportunity. And there's two ways for us to address that. One is continued and even more deployment of existing tools, which I don't think would drive intensity significantly higher, if that's all we do, but we do have new tools in the pipeline to address 3D NAND and when those come online and they're going to be in support of these advanced technologies, then we can actually drive increased adoption based on new use cases. There are more problems in 3D NAND metrology and defectivity than we can solve right now. And if we can bring the new tools out and get those in and those are something that we're targeting for in the next 12 to 24, having starting to make an impact on the market. So yeah, that will drive intensity up. Great. And a question for Bren in terms of managing supply chain, obviously yourself and the rest of the equipment industry, you're seeing record demand today and you've been able to turn around tools at a pretty rapid rate, even as demand trends continue to rise. You're also managing your inventories and AR really well. What have you done over the last couple of quarters, especially as you've seen this rise in demand and your ability to continue to I guess deliver to the customers, given their kind of strict and tight timelines for tool deliveries. Yeah. Well, it hasn't been easy. A lot of heavy lifting by the operational teams to execute in this environment. I mean, one of the things that we've done I think pretty effectively across all of our products is to do a lot more hedging of long lead time materials, whether we're buying supplier long lead time materials or we're buying our - the assembled parts and that shortens the lead time and gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to deliver. So that certainly is one of the things we're doing. I mean obviously, we're making stronger commitments further out in some cases to be able to make sure we've got the supplier ramping their capacity to be able to support us.
So a lot of tactical things there to be able to deliver that. We're spending some time sometimes, sending our own guys out to work with our suppliers to improve their processes to deliver better yields of parts and so on to be able to meet our needs. So a lot of small things there. Like everybody else, we're putting a lot of pressure on the chain. Some of our suppliers are unique and supply only to us in this space. So that helps in some cases, but it's a challenge, but so far we're doing okay with it and I'm really pleased with the leverage and the operational execution in the factories across the world for us. Your final question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Rick, I have a question on your foundry opportunity. TSMC on its earnings call talked about a flattish CapEx, with capital intensity longer term coming down from low to - 20% to 30% for them. Within that declining capital intensity, can you just talk about how do you see PDC opportunity for you? I assume EUV opportunity is obviously growing within that CapEx, but just talk about the PDC opportunity for you guys? And then I have a follow-up. Sure. I think that the foundry capital intensity ranges depending on where we are in the cycle and the customer, but it's somewhere in the order of 15% to 17%. We see upside to that, if we can provide more capability as we discussed earlier in 3D NAND. There are problems that are unsolved in terms of foundry and especially as we get to EUV. So we think that'll head toward the high end of that range. And customers of course are going to try to optimize their investment and try to minimize their investment in capital and in process control. So we're constantly showing that we have created value for them and then we share that value in terms of the way we deploy in the market. So I think as we're modeling it forward, it continues to be in that 15% to 17% range. Great. And then Bren, are you expecting your logic plus foundry opportunity this year to be flattish over last year, like prior comments or has there been a change to that. As I look at it and I look at the breadth of customers investing across foundry and as more of a shipment statement, I think the foundry shipments are probably down a little bit. So I think our expectations would be around foundry, as I said earlier, we're - foundry down a little bit, logic up, DRAM strong and NAND obviously strong as well. So that's how you get to the guidance we provided for WC. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks. Okay. Thank you, Magen. Thank you all for joining us today and enjoy the rest of your day. This concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.
In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us. I plan to briefly cover three items in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick review of KLA-Tencor's outstanding results in the March quarter, followed by highlights of our very strong market performance in 2017 as reported by Gartner, and concluding with our updated growth outlook for the industry and for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2018.
Let's begin with the March quarter highlights. I'm very happy to report another record quarter for KLA-Tencor, with revenue topping $1 billion for the first time in March and finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.02. These results were driven by our ongoing focus on customer success and technology leadership and reflect the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace across each of our major product groups and in services.
Also, on March 19 we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech, Limited. This acquisition is the next chapter in the progression of KLA-Tencor strategies for profitable growth and long-term value creation. With this combination, KLA-Tencor will be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services, extending our reach to address even more of the electronics value chain from semiconductor device manufacturing to packaging, printed circuit board and flat panel display manufacturing.
We have kicked off the integration planning and regulatory review efforts, and these processes are moving forward as planned. We are very impressed with the Orbotech team and are excited about the opportunities that this combination will create as we execute our strategies to benefit customers, stockholders and employees. Coupled with the momentum we are experiencing in our core inspection and measurement business, and with the prospect of augmenting that growth with the new assets from Orbotech, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for KLA-Tencor.
Turning now to highlights of the recently published Gartner market report for 2017. The data shows that in a very strong year for wafer fab equipment investment and with memory customers accounting for approximately 65% of overall WFE demand in 2017, KLA-Tencor grew or maintained a strong market position and drove SAM expansion in each of our major product markets, while addressing increasingly more complex inspection and measurement requirements in the marketplace.
With WFE forecasted to remain at a high level in 2018, we expect overall process control intensity to grow in the year, driven by growing value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China. As a leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to strengthen our position in China, both in terms of customer footprint and adoption.
We are still on the early stages of a multiyear investment cycle in China which represents a tremendous opportunity for KLA-Tencor. The presence of subscale factories under tremendous pressure to yield while still in start-up mode and the overall complexity associated with developing a world-class semiconductor industry will drive significant growth for our business in the region.
In addition, the high level of investment by memory customers has driven an unprecedented investment cycle in unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology to support capacity growth in wafer manufacturers and IC fabs, as well as to meet more stringent wafer cleanliness and wafer flatness specifications in vertical NAND. These products experienced record demand in 2017 with order momentum continuing in 2018 and with shipments and revenue expected to scale in this calendar year and into 2019.
Now for some product highlights that underlie our strong market performance. First, we saw particular strength in mask inspection in 2017. Gartner estimates that the mask inspection market grew 64% in the year to $538 million, fueled in large part by customer investment in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography.
KLA-Tencor's mask inspection technologies are critical to customer success in bringing EUV to market. We are collaborating with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development, yield and requalification. Other process control challenges inherent to EUV include resist qualification and scanner control. These, along with the complex patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV source technology, present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive process control portfolio in the semiconductor industry.
EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. The overlay metrology market grew 29% in 2017 to $456 million. KLA-Tencor is a pioneer in overlay metrology, deploying unique capability across two different technology platforms. The growth of memory investment in 2017 was a major factor in the strength in overlay metrology and in other metrology markets for KLA-Tencor in the year, driven by the increased complexity in advanced memory design architecture, including multiple layers and film stacks and verticalization of structures.
Finally, in optical pattern wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor's largest served market, the SAM grew 6% in the year to over $1.3 billion. And we experienced our strong market leadership driven by customer preference for our broadband plasma and laser scattering optical inspection portfolio over competing wafer inspection technologies including e-beam.
These are just a few of the product successes that led to our sales growth and SAM expansion in 2017. This growth is a result of the continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address increasing inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive customer success in a period of strong growth for the semiconductor industry.
Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2018. Coming off an exceptionally strong year in 2017, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today is solid, supporting a WFE industry growth outlook that is currently expected to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits in 2018. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory once again comprising 70% or more of WFE investment in 2018, led by the ongoing ramp in 3D NAND, capacity expansion in DRAM and continued investment from China memory.
In foundry, we are expecting to see orders for the first wave of investment in five nanometers to begin in the second half of the year, with logic investment in 2018 focused on 10 nanometer. And finally, we expect continued expansion of EUV lithography investment in foundry and DRAM in the year. Given our technology leadership, strong customer acceptance of new products, improving process control intensity and leading edge memory and our strength in China, KLA-Tencor is expecting to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2018. This does not include any contribution from the Orbotech acquisition which we expect to close by the end of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren? Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented an outstanding period of financial performance for the company. Shipment, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue and earnings per share finishing at record levels. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives.
Revenue was $1.021 billion in the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.02. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.
Now turning to highlights of the March demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.019 billion, finishing at the top end of the guided range for the quarter, with upside driven by higher-than-expected customer pull for our overlay metrology products. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion. Based on our current build plans and expected customer delivery timing, we continue to expect second half shipments to grow in the mid-single digits compared to the first half of the calendar year. For the full year, we expect shipment growth in the high-single digits.
Memory was 78% of shipments and stronger than our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 47% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the June quarter with memory shipments forecasted to be approximately 68% of the total in Q2. Memory mix is expected to remain between 60% and 70% of shipments in the second half of 2018. Foundry was 13% of shipments in March, and foundry is forecasted to be about 24% of shipments in June. Logic was 9% of shipments in the March quarter, and our current outlook is for logic to be 8% of total systems shipments next quarter.
In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 45%; patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 22%; and non-semi was approximately 4%.
I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.021 billion in March, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Service revenue was a contributor to the upside in the quarter as customer utilization at the installed base remains at a high level. We expect revenue to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.08 billion in the June quarter, and for revenue in the second half of calendar 2018 to be in accordance with our outlook for full year revenue growth of 10% or greater.
Gross margin was 64%, in line with our guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance were consistent with recent margin trends in terms of product mix, efficient execution of new product introduction and variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Looking forward to June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65% as a richer product mix is expected in the quarter. Our gross margin guidance of 63% to 64% in calendar 2018 remains unchanged, however, current trends support a bias towards the high end of this range.
Total operating expenses were $261 million in March, down about $2 million compared with December, and operating margin was 38.5%. Operating expenses for the March quarter were approximately $5 million higher than guidance due to a number of factors, including higher material cost for next-generation programs.
We continue to see many opportunities for future top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and vertical memory applications. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $262 million to $264 million. In the second half of 2018, we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $265 million to $270 million per quarter, with variability around this operating expense level driven by the timing of non-head count engineering program development costs.
Our outlook is for operating margin in 2018 to be in excess of 38.5%, consistent with our published business model in the $4.2 billion to $4.5 million annualized revenue range. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter, in line with our guidance and our long-term planning rate Finally, net income for the March quarter was a record $318 million and we had $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
I'll turn now to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.89 billion, an increase of approximately $132 million compared with December. Cash from operations was $353 million in March and free cash flow was $338 million. In Q1, we paid an aggregate of $92 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $85 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.
In February, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.75 per share. That's effective this quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had $1 billion authorized under our new share repurchase program, as well as authorization for an additional $1 billion contingent upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. We plan to resume share repurchases in the June quarter consistent with our previously articulated approach. We expect the amount of share repurchases in the June quarter will be limited given legal restrictions following the distribution of the proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the Orbotech shareholder vote on the merger. Our current plan is to accelerate our share repurchase activity following the completion of the shareholder vote subject to market conditions.
Finally, I'll note that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. We will be adopting ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. We will provide additional information on the impact of the new standard on KLA-Tencor's financial reporting in our next earnings call in July.
In conclusion, the results demonstrated by the company in the March quarter and in the 2017 Gartner report reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' growth strategies, and the value of our industry-leading business model and capital allocation strategies. We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the electronics industry today, driven by new demand drivers such as artificial intelligence, big data, automotive and the Internet of Things layered on top of the traditional computing and mobility markets.
This is a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors. As the market leader in semiconductor process control and with the new opportunities presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and to create long-term enduring value.
Looking forward to 2018 and beyond, we are energized by what lies ahead. Fueled by record total backlog of just under $1.9 billion as of the end of the March quarter, we are positioned for revenue growth of 10% or more in the year against the backdrop of the overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow in the high-single digit to low-double digit range.
With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is shipments in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion, revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $2 to $2.24 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.02 to $2.26 per share.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have today's call. Feel free to re-queue for additional questions as time permits.
All right, Jeff, we're ready for the first. All right. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead. Thank you very much. Hi. Hi, guys. So the first question obviously is on memory. I don't ever remember you guys shipping 65%, 70%, which is basically in line with the market. I don't ever remember you guys having memory concentration that's sort of in line with the market. Typically it's quite a bit lower. So I guess my question is, is it like a one-time deal related to China? Is it a big uptick in memory process control intensity? Can you just talk about that? Thanks. Hey, Tim. I'll take it and then give it to Bren. Yes and yes. I mean, I think China definitely helps because of the greenfield fabs, which are always great for process control intensity, but also newer players needing to get the capability to ramp. The second part is that we have new capability which the market is recognizing the need for, and so we're seeing increased process control adoption as a result of that. And that's both in the developments in NAND, but also in DRAM as they continue to push design rules. Hey, Tim. Welcome back. So I don't have much more to add. I mean, to Rick's point, I mean, China, we did ship pretty significantly into DRAM project in China. We're going to ship into a NAND project this quarter so we see a lot of momentum there.
I think from a metrology perspective and inspection perspective, we're seeing some solid adoption in both segments, NAND a little bit stronger than DRAM from a process control intensity perspective. So we're really, I think, excited about our positioning there, and we've got some products in the pipeline that hopefully will help drive intensity further. Okay, great. Bren, can you – I guess, just as a follow-up, can you talk about the timing on those products? I know sort of the industry's been waiting for a product that can really help ramp yields in 3D NAND. You guys have been developing that product suite for now sometime, can you talk about when that's going to really shift and when that's going to become meaningful in terms of revenue, and that could really drive the sort of organic memory process control intensity up for you? Thanks. Yeah. And I mean on the inspection side, the inspection problem is proving – it's a difficult challenge for customers and proving to be a pretty challenging engineering problem. We've got some tools out in the field, we're working with customers in evaluation phase. We'll see if that translates into a high-volume production product or not. I think the jury is still out, but we're doing a lot of work on that front. And I think that's one area.
I think on the other area is a product in metrology where we've shipped a couple of probe tools into the field for in-stack metrology and so we're hopeful we'll get some traction there. I don't think these products contribute to the financial results we've been discussing or the outlook over the next six to nine months. But certainly as we move into 2019, we'll see – hopefully we'll get some traction there and we'll see those will be a bigger percent of the total. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Our second question comes from the line of Mr. Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarterly execution. We just got off the Intel call and they just pushed out their 10-nanometer ramp to the yield issues. We've also heard of yield challenges by some of your memory customers, especially on the DRAM side. You guys have always characterized your flagship Gen 5 wafer inspection platform as more of an opportunity as EUV starts to get more proliferation. But just given all of the current yield challenges in logic and memory, have you guys seen some pull-ins of the GEN 5 adoption into calendar 2018 by your customer base? We have had good success with the GEN 5. I think we are still in the mode of proving out the capability before it ramps into production. We do have a couple of places where we're seeing multiple units ramping. But it is a relatively long cycle. We have seen the pull-in of product nodes. So in the case where we did think it'd be more tied to EUV, we've seen more work characterization of existing nodes kind of to the problems that you're talking about. I think people felt like maybe they'd resolved some of the yield challenges are definitely using some of their initial capability to debug. So we are seeing some opportunity for that. But it's still – it's kind of as we expected. It's a relatively long adoption cycle once people get in the evaluation. And most of the customers are encouraged but continuing to push that. So Harlan, by the end of this year, we will have either shipped or booked for dollars somewhere near 18 to 20 systems into the field across all segments, and I think that's one of the things that we're encouraged by that we are solving issues in development across all segments with the customers around discovery use cases but also EUV use cases. So most of the roadmap for that product line right now is about how do you prepare for volume production for 5 nanometer and beyond. And most of the engineering effort on that tool is to speed up throughput and work through tunable sensitivity and some of the other opportunities to make it more production viable. So the traction is good. It's demonstrating value and it's demonstrating value across all segments which we're encouraged with. Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then according to some of those recent market share statistics that you were talking about, Bren, your reticle inspection business grew by over 2x in 2017. Obviously, it's the highest profitability segment for you guys. Early EUV adoption, I think, was probably one of the strong drivers for the 2017 performance. But as we think about accelerated EUV adoption this year, do you guys think that the reticle inspection business can grow this year off of the strong results last year? First question. And then can you guys just give us an update on your next-generation EUV e-beam reticle inspection platform? Thanks. Yeah. Let me take it. Maybe to view it from a portfolio perspective, we did see strength as you mentioned and we talked about in the prepared remarks due to a number of new tapeouts at advanced design rules and this, of course, being driven largely by people pushing designs and mask shock capability for EUV but not only that. Yes, we do see continued strength overall in support of EUV. And when we look at our overall process control intensity for EUV as compared to optical, if you look at the one scanner of optical Deep UV versus EUV, you need a similar percentage, maybe a little bit more percentage of process control intensity to support that. That includes the fractional use of reticle tools as well as wafer tools in order to support it.
So while the overall industry in general may see capital intensity decline in areas other than litho, process control will track and maybe even outpace litho for process control intensity for EUV. So we're encouraged by that. In terms of e-beam, we're finding that there is a lot of appetite for the optical extensions that we have on the platform, and so we continue to support our customers with that. One of the nodes of the – the comments of the slipping out of nodes due to yield means they're also delaying advanced EUV insertion, which gives the optical a longer runway. So we feel very well-positioned to support that. Hey, Harlan. This is Bren. The only thing I'll add to that is that we had talked about introducing that tool in the marketplace sometime in calendar 2019. Our views on that haven't changed. I would expect that it's more towards the end of 2019 than the first half. But our plans are moving forward and it's going to intersect the HVM at the right time. So nothing really new to add on that front since what we updated you with last quarter. All right. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great set of results. Rick, my first question is in regards to the foundry shipments. It's a two-part question, basically. First, when I look at the foundry shipments, they are pretty much at an all-time low. And I just want to ask how is the trajectory from here. It seems like even in the back half, it's not going up nearly to the level that you have seen historically.
And second, as you talked about EUV, when I look at the EUV shipments that ASML is having in the foundry segment, it seems pretty strong recently but I don't see that reflected in the foundry shipments that you are having. So is there a difference in timing in terms of when the EUV ships and when you would actually start to benefit? Yeah, I'll take it, but I'll also have Bren comment as well. In support of EUV, the question we're just addressing – we have seen reticle, so I think the reticle timing of that is maybe more consistent with the shipments of EUV tools and that is support of the same development work that's going on.
We do expect to see an increase toward the end of the year in activity around the ordering for 5 nanometer node, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I think that that is coming and that's something that we'll see later. And to your point, we had a great quarter but it wasn't really driven by our foundry business and we expect that to be late 2018 and carry over into 2019. Yeah. I mean, to the point it's – we're performing, I think, at a pretty high level here with a lot of unique inflections that are driving our business absent the strong foundry of logic environment. And I think as we move through this year stays during memory centric, but beyond that we would expect foundry to coming a little bit stronger. To your point it's at the very low level, almost historical low level.
But when you look at the comments we made earlier around China, you look at the EUV development activity, you look at the activity we see in the wafer space and then this improving process control relevance in and around the different memory segments, it's a good story for us this year and I think as we move into the future with stronger foundry environment then we'll see that kick in. And as you know, the process control intensity and foundry logic tends to be closer to 2x what it is in memory. So not every dollar of WFE is created equal when it comes to our business, and so certainly if you see a pickup in that segment so that's a significant positive for us. Got it. And then my second question is in regards to the mask inspection and broadly the strength that you saw last year. I wanted to understand how much of it is just driven by increasing mix towards ASICs. In cloud, we are seeing more and more companies moving to application-specific processes. So what I wanted to get a sense of is that as the foundry mix moves from low mix (31:55), which is a limited number of designs starting in the fab to a high mix in an environment where there are a lot more designs running in the fab, how does that affect your business?
And secondly, as we think about the mask inspection business, the strong growth that you saw last year, was it a one-time phenomenon, or as the ASICs strength continues in the future, could this be a higher growth business for you? Well, it certainly scales with the tapeouts, right? And you could even have a situation where you see reticle capacity put in place where you don't necessarily see it coincide with wafer starts because you have to do the tapeouts but maybe the volumes into the low-volume design. So clearly, we're seeing more activity there, certainly even at 7-nanometer. And so you're seeing more investment in and around reticles with a 7-nanometer width with the multi-patterning schemes that are being deployed. It does drive a need for reticle capacity around writers and inspectors, and if there's a nice ratio of one to two units to – or one inspector to every two to three writers in a mask shop. So that's certainly a driver for us, and we think that as we move through the end of this year and into next year, I think that there's momentum around that that continues. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, if you look at the Gartner data you said earlier, process control grew at roughly half the rate of WFE. And obviously, that make sense given how much the spend is driven by memory. Curious what the scenario you would see where process control would outgrow WFE. And do you think that that's something we could see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months? And if so, what would be the precise drivers there? Yeah. C.J., great question. I think if we just held firm, in other words if the mix didn't move as much toward memory and if you held memory as a ratio to foundry logic was the same in a year where it was flat, then of course we believe process control intensity would grow.
Even though process control intensity did go up in memory, as Bren mentioned and as you all know, it can't make up for the mix shift that we saw. So I'd say that would be the main way of process control intensity because a growing memory market on a relative basis but on a process control intensity that goes down if you do a weighted average. I mean, we've looked at it, C.J. I mean, a rule of thumb is usually for about a 10-point swing in mix you end up with 70 or 80 basis point shift in intensity. So it tends to move around a little bit depending on who's buying and so on, but that's a reasonable way to think about it. So to Rick's point, certainly we start to see foundry logic as a percent of total increase, and that will be good for process control intensity. And we've seen it at closer to the 50% range and 50% to 60% – 50% foundry or so in that ballpark is when we've seen process control outperform. To Rick's point, I think as you move into an EUV environment, certainly if the process control may be scaling with litho, that certainly maybe adds a different element to the ability for process control to grow online. That's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, are you guys disclosing bookings backlog anymore? No? We do in our 10-K. If I give you the backlog and the shipment, then that sort of gets you to the bookings number. But I will tell you that we were slightly below a book-to-bill of 1 this quarter. Okay. And then one quick follow-on. As you think about the transaction with Orbotech, what are the restrictions on your ability to buy back shares between now and close? So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a small window that I have this quarter or prior to – from the opening of our quiet period to the filing of the prospectus and the S-4. So it's a very small window where we will begin our activity but it'll be limited.
So then we have no restrictions – so we're restricted at that point and then we have no restriction after the shareholder vote has occurred. So based on current schedules and those could move around, based on comments from the SEC and so on if you get those, but that would imply that we would begin buying back in a more significant way sometime in the second half of next quarter, of the September quarter. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. You may go ahead. Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in terms of the capital intensity trends you're seeing in the memory market as a whole. Obviously 3D NAND has helped a lot of your metrology business, but DRAM has also picked up in terms of spending for both 2018 and may carry into 2019. I know your inspection business benefits from the more multi-patterning steps, but are there other areas or other applications as DRAM continues to shrink that also benefit, I guess, both process control intensity and for you specifically? Yes. For DRAM, we do see a push for more capability for inspection, both the high-speed kind of inspection that we do in monitoring, which is laser scanning based but also in development, which is GEN 5 oriented and the leading edge. We also see overlay challenges in DRAM are very significant, and it drives our metrology business for overlay. And so yes, there is an increasing trend. 3D NAND has probably had more growth and on a relative basis than DRAM, but we do see increasing trends in DRAM as well. Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question going back to China for a second. I think last quarter you talked about the Chinese foundry segment being a area, one, of growth, but also that's probably the area first where you're seeing a pickup. It seems like this call has kind of shifted a bit to the memory side of things. Is the Chinese foundry markets still tracking as you thought and it's just being supplemented now by the memory market? I think that the Chinese foundry market has slowed a little bit and we're seeing some delays there whereas the Chinese memory market continues to move forward the investment and they're dealing with all the things you'd expect from bringing greenfield fabs up in terms of challenges with getting facilities ready and tools installed. But we do see strength in the memory. As Bren said, we'll see more of that. It has been a little bit softer on the foundry side, though. All right. Thank you very much. Just on the mix from an order perspective, and there's some lead time to these orders because of the site construction. But order profile in calendar 2018 is probably closer to 50/50. So the order profile in 2017 was heavier memory, and those are the tools that are shipping. So from a shipment perspective, it's more memory-centric. But the orders, which will start – will come through and will ship into next year have a more of an equal weight to them. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Great. Thank you so much. I guess on your foundry business, how should we think about the breadth of your business as the industry approaches 7 nanometer-plus and then 5 nanometer? Should we expect something similar to 28 where you had multiple customers investing pretty aggressively, or a fairly consolidated customer mix there? We haven't really seen dropout happen for many players as we're going to 7 nanometer, so I'd say the same people that were in, I think they're phased in terms of their investment. There aren't that many players doing the advanced design rules for foundry but they're all still in and we expect them at various phases to be investing. So no real change in breadth from the foundries on the advanced nodes. Okay, got it. And then as my follow-up, I think last quarter you guys talked about domestic China orders tripling in 2017. Curious what your expectations are for 2018, if any? Thank you. Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see a continuation of the momentum there just given where they are in terms of the early innings with some of these investments. I would say the numbers look relatively flat to us from an order perspective my lead time comment earlier notwithstanding. So we'll see how it plays through as they move through the quarter. Obviously, there's some second-half dependency to that profile but for right now it looks like it's fairly consistent versus what we saw last year. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead. Yes. Thank you. And I apologize I also have a question about foundry. I guess your major foundry customers, my impression is they generate a meaningful portion of the revenues from the mobile market. And that market is pretty subdued across the board. And so the question is can we see a sustained recovery in your foundry business as smartphone demand remains weak? Because seeing foundry revenues even for June down a healthy double-digit percentage, it just doesn't seem like the node transitions are enough. Well, we're pretty down in foundry. So I mean, I think our profile is consistent with that. And we don't anticipate a lot of strength in foundry until we get later into the end of the year and into 2019. So all our commentary and all our forecasting agrees with your thesis that there's a point here. We are seeing increased activities, however, around advanced node and investment and that's, of course, the precursor to more investment that's coming.
So we're definitely seeing it and some of the reticle business that we're seeing now is in support of that. So given historical patterns, the same path is being followed where you have the initial investment around the development followed by a ramp. The size of those ramps may be smaller than in the past, and that's part of what we anticipate and model as we talk about our business going forward. Okay. Great. Thanks, Bren. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. You may go ahead. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. Rick, you were a keynote speaker at recent SEMICON China. I'm sure you got a chance to talk to some of the executives driving the China 2025 plan. How do you expect domestic Chinese spending to behave in the face of the recent trade tariffs and the tensions between U.S. and China? And then I have a follow-up. Right. I don't think anything's changed from the perspective of the Chinese in terms of what we've seen in terms of some of the discussions. This is a program to gain self-sufficiency in memory and in logic over time because China's such a big importer of semiconductors. So I don't think there's any change. I thought you were going to ask me what does it sound like? And we take their numbers and cut them in half and we still have a big growth forecast for China based on the investment level that we're seeing and the activity that's going on there. But I don't see any change as a result of any of the recent noise in the system around trade. Okay. And then as a follow-up on the Orbotech deal, I'm curious what kind of feedback have you received from your three big customers on this deal? And Bren, if you can just talk about the regulatory milestones required on this deal? Does it require China MOFCOM approval and some of the other approvals? Thanks. I'll take the first part and Bren could take the second. There's really been very little commentary from customers. This is such a different deal that even in the case where the larger customers are focused on some of them have interest in both areas, they're not in the same organization so there's not much overlap. I think the one thing that our customers have said consistently is they don't want us to lose focus on what we're doing for them and we're not. Structurally, we're going to organize in such a way that we will maintain every bit as much focus as we have today supporting our existing customers. But that has been the only commentary we've heard at all is please continue to support us but there was no assumption by them, that we wouldn't. They just – when they felt compelled to voice something, that was it. And then on the regulatory front, I mean, by the end of this week we will have had all of our filings submitted which is our plan and according to schedule. There's one that will take another week or so, and that's not for any reason other than that there's a holiday in that country that's delaying the submission given the clock that exists on the review period. So everything moving according to plan. Jeff, our next question? Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. You may go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up on the Orbotech deal as well. So with kind of this trade tension with China and U.S., do you see that potentially creates some challenges for you guys to get the regulatory approval from MOFCOM? We don't. That's not something that we have heard about. I think that again, if you look at the nature of any of the deals that have had issues associated with that, they look nothing like this. So we don't anticipate that. Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, Rick, on your -- answering one of the question, you mentioned that you see EUV and DUV to process control intensity similar – in a similar or even a higher level. Can you clarify that? Is that mostly coming in with higher reticle inspection in EUV? And just to be really clear, are you talking about EUV versus similar type of multi-patterning DUV process, you get a similar process control CapEx per CapEx spend? If you can provide some color on that. Thank you. Yeah. Well, we haven't worked out the entire model of that. But if you're just talking about what it takes in process control intensity to support a deep UV scanner versus what it takes to support an EUV scanner, obviously an EUV scanner is more expensive. But the tools necessary from a process control standpoint to support that are more advanced or are more intense. So the resulting intensity around a scanner choice actually goes up slightly in terms of total dollars, acknowledging that the cost of an EUV scanner is higher, the process control intensity actually scale a little bit faster than the scanner cost in order to support it. And that's simply the ecosystem around the scanner. So the reticle qualifying, the wafer is qualifying, the image, the measurements that are necessary to support that. It doesn't take into account all the other things where there'd be a reduction in layers. But just from that standpoint, so we view the EUV as being a catalyst for additional growth for KLA-Tencor as it comes online. Great. Actually that's very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Mr. Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead. Thanks. I'm still trying to make sense of this foundry shipment into the back half of the year. If you look at Lam's shipments, and I know that Lam's obviously a different company but – and you sort of noodle through their guidance, it implies that foundry shipments are like up 2x the second half versus first half. And if you graphed their shipments versus your shipments, there's a pretty strong correlation between the trend for them and the trend for you. And it seems like maybe this time it's like breaking down a little bit, and maybe the answer is that you are seeing an offset from this change at a big logic customer, maybe that's sort of offsetting some of what would otherwise be a very, very strong foundry ramp so that that stuff ultimately comes back, but maybe it just gets pushed into next year. I'm just kind of trying to make sense of that. Thank you. Yeah, Tim. It's Bren. So our foundry shipments of the second half are higher than the first half. So I want to be clear about that and in a pretty meaningful way. I mean, I think it's getting dwarfed by the amount of the memory shipments. But when you talk about shipment profile in the range that we discussed, somewhere in the $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range, the 60% to 70% of that will be memory, and that's how we're seeing it. But there is a pickup. But on an absolute basis, certainly foundry is weaker overall compared to the inflections in memory we're seeing. Okay, Bren. Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may ask your questions. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. KLA has always kind of separated itself from the pack due to its premium margin structure or free cash flow generation. I'm just trying to do a sanity check here. So pro forma for Orbotech, I think the target operating margin is looking to be 36%. So are the free cash flow margins going to be somewhere in that kind of 32% to 34% range? Or how should we think about free cash flow margins pro forma for the combined company? Yes. So when we look at pro forma operating margins in the timeframe of, let's say, post synergy realization, 2020 pro forma, you'll end up with about, yeah, 36% or so operating income. So if we think against that level of income, we would see free cash flow margins somewhere in the – consistent with where we are today, maybe slightly below because our operating margins are a little bit higher. But the relative capital intensity of the two businesses is similar. So I think we're in and around that 30% range against that level of operating income. And obviously, it'll vary depending on where we are in terms of working capital investments and so on.
But one thing that's attractive about the business is the growth but also the lower capital intensity of it. And so as we bring it together, and as we start to drive through synergies and scale these businesses and get up to these mid- to high-30% operating margins, we should be able to drive free cash flow margin somewhere in the – right around 30% plus or minus. Great. Thanks. Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, please continue. Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in KLA-Tencor. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","we're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2018 . a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website . this includes our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017 .",1.0

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Lance. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it on our website.
Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on our non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release and in the Investor Relation presentation on KLA-Tencor’s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rick. Thanks, Ed. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter for KLA-Tencor with shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finishing at the upper end of guidance. KLA-Tencor delivered the second highest quarterly booking results in our history in the June quarter offsetting all-time records in quarterly shipments, revenue GAAP, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. I am also pleased to report that we ended the June quarter with a positive book-to-bill with record total backlog of almost $2 million. Also we are pleased to note our continued progress our timeline for closing the Orbotech acquisition in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. On July 12, the Orbotech shareholders approved the merger and to-date we have received all the necessary regulatory approvals with the exception of Korea and China, which we expect to obtain in due course.
The record results and strong momentum KLA-Tencor is delivering today demonstrates the value of our market leadership and the critical nature of process control. They also highlight our market diversification and the benefits of our exposure to growth markets, such as EUV lithography, the early ramp of 7-nanometer devices in foundry, growth in bare wafer market to address capacity growth in memory in China to highlight a few. The overall, WFE industry environment continues to perform at a high level and we are excited about the prospects for continued strength in industry demand as we begin the second half of 2018 and look ahead to 2019. Our view is for WFE levels to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2018 aligned with the current consensus growth forecast for the year. Against this industry backdrop, our view for KLA-Tencor revenue growth is in the low double-digits for the calendar year.
Now, let’s discuss some of the unique dynamics that are fueling our market leadership and diversified growth. First, we are experiencing near record levels of demand in mask inspection and registration fueled by customers’ investments in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography supporting 10 and 7-nanometer design tape-out. KLA-Tencor is working with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development and yield learning providing a complete portfolio of advanced mask inspection solutions. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth for process control as it continues to enable linear scaling and presents market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address as the market leader in mask and wafer inspection as well as in films, CD and overlay metrology.
Another example is in how over the past several quarters we have seen exceptional growth in demand for bare wafer inspection and metrology solutions driven by the expansion of bare wafer supply associated with a strong memory market as well as more stringent cleanliness and flatness requirements for bare wafers. In addition, IC, memory and logic customers are also experience – increased their investment in process tool qualification to limit yield excursions and to meet aggressive yield and capacity ramp goals.
A third example of how KLA-Tencor is benefiting from our market diversification and technology leadership is seen in our strong results in China. Investment in China is the next major market inflection of WFE and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable development and growth of the China semiconductor industry. Our customers in China are investing with us in a high level to accelerate early process development and yield learning with our product portfolio as advanced process control solutions and our demonstrated ability to meet aggressive ramp schedules, KLA-Tencor business in China is operating at a high level and we expect it to remain strong for the foreseeable future.
And finally, KLA-Tencor’s service business continues to be a highlight. Service is approaching $1 billion in annual revenue today and is expected to continue deliver consistent high single-digit annual revenue growth over the next several years. I will note that greater than 75% of service revenue is from service contracts to enable needed up-time of our systems demonstrating the value of the insight and technology these systems provide to enable customer success. Long-term growth in services is tied to growth in the installed base as well as from expanding investment and trailing edge fabs, which are running at full utilization in creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades.
To sum up today’s results before I turn the call over to Bren June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor demonstrating the company’s strong execution and fast growing industry environment. Given our market diversification and the record levels of demand we are experiencing in the marketplace, 2018 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for KLA-Tencor and we are encouraged by the early signs of continuing momentum we are seeing for 2019.
I will now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren? Thanks, Rick and good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue, shipments and earnings per share once again achieving record levels. These results were driven by strong demand across our major product markets as well as the solid execution of our strategic objectives.
Revenue was $1.070 billion in the June quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were both $2.22. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.
Now, turning to highlights of the June demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.07 billion, about $20 million above the midpoint of guidance and finishing into top end of the guidance range for the quarter driven by strength in memory. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be down almost 10% at the midpoint and be in the range of $935 million or $1.015 billion. Our current expectation is for shipment growth in the second half of calendar ‘18 to be flat to up low single-digits compared with the first half with sequential quarterly growth resuming in the December quarter. While second half shipments will be stronger than the first half, this half to half growth expectation is modestly lower than our expectations from 3 months ago given the widely reported memory push-outs in slowing logic investment.
Our shipment mix in the second half of the year has continued strong customer pull from our memory customers, including those in China, ramping bare wafer products and expected pickup in foundry logic shipments in the second half of the year. Memory was 69% of shipments and in line with our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 28% of total system shipments in the period. For September, we expect memory shipments to be approximately 59% of the total. Foundry was 22% of shipments in the June quarter and foundry is forecasted to be about 36% of shipments in Q3 driven by increases in EUV investment and 7-nanometer design starts. Logic was 9% of shipments and our current outlook is for logic to be approximately 5% of total system shipments this quarter.
In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments, patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for our metrology businesses and for reticle inspection; service was 21%; and non-semi was approximately 3%. Revenue was a record $1.070 billion in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect September revenue to be flat into midpoint and be in the range of $1.030 to $1.110 billion for the quarter. Revenue in the second half of calendar ‘18 is expected to grow in the mid single-digits compared with first half, aligned with our current outlook for revenue growth in the low double-digits in the calendar year.
Gross margins were 64.8% at the upper end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance in June were consistent with recent margin trends for the efforts largely driven by product mix. Looking forward to September, we expect gross margins to again be in the range of 64% to 65% as improving service margins offset slightly weaker product system mix.
Total operating expenses were $265 million in June and operating margin was 40%. We continue to see many opportunities for top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and advanced memory applications to name three important examples. For the September quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $270 million with variability around its operating expense level driven principally by the timing of non-headcount engineering program development costs.
For the full year in calendar ‘18, we expect operating margins to be in the 39% range, solidly above the targeted 38% plus margin level in our published business model for these revenue levels and demonstrating KLA-Tencor’s leading market position and business execution. Free cash flow margin is currently forecasted to be in the upper 20th percentile in 2018, ranking KLA-Tencor among the top tier companies in our industry. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter in line with our guidance and our long-term tax planning rate. Finally, net income for the June quarter was a record $348 million and we had 156.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
Turning briefly to highlights of the June quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at almost $2.9 billion. Cash from operations was strong at $374 million and free cash flow was $351 million. In the quarter, we retired $225 million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility, paid in aggregate of $117 in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $38 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. At the end of the June quarter, we had just under $1 million authorized under our share repurchase program. Legal restrictions related to the timing of shareholder approval of the Orbotech transaction limited our repurchase activity in Q2, but we plan to resume repurchases in the September quarter targeting quarterly repurchase volumes consistent with our previously articulated approach, an expected 12 to 18 month timeframe subject to market conditions. We have an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorized upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.
Finally, I will note that we will adopt a new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are adopting ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. Also throughout FY ‘19 which ends on June 30, 2019, we will provide a quarterly reconciliation of reported revenue as well as what revenue would have been under the old reporting standards in order to help investors quantify the impact of differences in revenue recognition under the old and new standards. We do not foresee any impact to cash flows or business operations from the adoption of ASC 606. However, adoption of ASC 606 will impact reported revenue.
Here is the summary of two primary changes to revenue recognition resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. First, instead of accruing the cost of 1-year warranties for systems that we sell to our customers, we will allocate revenue to the warranty element of each transaction and recognized the revenue over the warranty period since we will provide preventative maintenance as well as repair services during the warranty period in a manner consistent with our normal service contracts. Second, we will continue to recognize systems revenue at the point of time where we have satisfied our performance obligations and transfer control of the product to a customer. The determination of satisfaction and performance obligations is based on several factors, including the transfer of title, physical possession of the tool by the customer, customer acceptance of the product and whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of consumer products. We expect that the new standard will generally allow for earlier timing of revenue recognition and circumstances were to deem that sufficient performance indicators have been satisfied to conclude that control has been transferred to the customer.
We are still assessing the overall impact to revenue from adoption of the new standard. As I mentioned in the detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition between the old and new standards will be provided on a quarterly basis, beginning with the reporting of the results for the September quarter. Going forward, quarterly guidance including the guidance for the September quarter will only be provided based on the new rules. We will report actual revenue under both sets of rules for every quarter in fiscal ‘19 and our Form 10-Q. Although there are future factors in terms of shipment, timing and customer acceptance of products, including packed results under both standards, based on current shipment and revenue forecast, we expect the difference in reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable in calendar ‘18 and in the range of 1% plus or minus 50 basis points higher when compared with the old standard.
In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor’s June quarter reflects the company’s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer’s growth strategies and the value of our industry leading business model. The semiconductor and semi-equipment industry environment today is strong, healthy and performing at a high level with multiple growth fueled by demand from exciting new applications such as artificial intelligence, big data, increasing semiconductor automotive content and the Internet of Things layered on top of investment in China in the traditional computing and mobility markets. As the market leader in process control and with our revenue diversification within the labor fab equipment market, coupled with the new opportunities for growth in market expansion presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and it continues to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
Looking forward to the second half of 2018 and beyond fueled by record total backlog at the end of the June quarter and growth in revenue in the second half of the year, we are positioned for another year of solid growth in 2018 and look forward to more of the same in 2019. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is shipments in the range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, revenue between $1.030 billion and $1.110 billion and GAAP diluted EPS $2 to 2.32 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 to $2.36 per share.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we would like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to re-queue for any additional questions you may have and we will do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today’s call as time permits.
Alright, Lance, we are ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks very much. Bren, I guess the first question is it looks like you lost maybe $50 million in shipments for the entirety of the second half, almost all of which was in the third calendar quarter. So I guess my question is with this all memory and the inevitable question is going to be why should everyone trust that September quarter is going to be the bottom of what is – what you see to basically catalyze Q4 being better? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Yes, Tim. So, it’s pretty well chronicled about some of the push-outs that we have seen over the last month or so, and that’s an industry statement. Yes, it was mostly memory. There was some impact in some other segments as well, but most of it is memory. Based on what we see in our build plans, we see a pretty strong snapback into the December quarter and all indications here at this point given our conversations with customers with all customers is that that’s the case. So, we are pretty confident about it. I think it’s our customers behaving rationally in terms of how they are managing capacity and we would expect it to come back in Q4. Awesome, thanks. And then just as my follow-up question, you guys almost always are at or above the high-end of the earnings range. So, if I assume that, that’s going to happen again in the third quarter that would put you at basically $950 million to $960 million in annualized earnings, so the stock will be trading at roughly 10.5x to 11x earnings. So I would think that you are chomping at the bit to basically buyback your stock at these levels. So, can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for repo and what the cadence might be once you are able to do that? Thanks. So, we authorized $1 billion, which I covered this in the prepared remarks, we authorized $1 billion and then another $1 billion contingent on the closing of the Orbotech acquisition and a timeframe for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. So, we were able to do that for legal reasons in the June quarter and we would expect that we plan to begin doing that in a much more aggressive way beginning this quarter. So, we tend to be very principled focus in terms of how we think about the execution of this in the principle that ultimately drives how we think about deploying the cash flows of the company. So we plan to do that in a systematic way, although we do have flexibility to be opportunistic as we move over the next 12 months, but we expect to step up our posture and we will increase it even further after we close the Orbotech acquisition. Awesome, Bren. Thanks so much. The next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution guys. On the significantly better sustainability of your business relative to others in the equipment market, you guys have always talked about your business as being more tied to the rate of new technology migration versus capacity addition, I think your EUV mask inspection platform is a good example of that, Gen-5 is a good example of that. And it seems that technology migration cadence continues to be strong across all segments of the market, is that at a high level how we should think about the sustainability of your business here in the second half relative to what your peers are seeing out there that are probably more a little bit more capacity focused? Hey, Harlan, it’s Rick. I think that’s right, there is a couple factors. One, we do have a more diversified set of customers as opposed to being pure-play and so we have got a number of elements if you think about mask manufacturing, but also wafer manufacturing has been an important segment for us and that has capacity and technology built into it as customers push the sensitivity requirements and flatness requirements of our wafer manufacturers that drives the business cycle there, reticles for new tape-outs for EUV, you talked about Gen-5, there is also – it’s also true in metrology products. So, it’s a broad base of customers all advancing technologies both memory and logic and we also have of course the activities that are going on in China, so pretty broad and we feel good about the diversification of the customer base at this point. Thanks for the insights there. And the other thing that you guys have talked about and I am wondering again how much does this add to a pretty strong second half demand profile is that you guys have talked about strong new product pipeline right, which in some cases is expanding your SAM opportunity like the Voyager platform. Did you guys just recently introduced for pulsatile developed inspection. You also introduced your Surfscan SP7 tool. Here you guys got 90% market share like how is the new product cadence and in some cases the SAM expansion helping the momentum here in the second half and into next year? Well, we have always been a product company, Harlan. So we do need this innovation and does two things. One, it enables our customers to move their technology forward. It also makes it very challenging from a competitive standpoint for people to keep up with us given the rate of introduction and investment in new capability. And as you point out, we are bringing out new platforms that will have the new addressable markets in addition to the ones that you mentioned with Voyager and SP7, their other products in the pipeline. So, it gives us a lot of confidence as we finish off calendar ‘18 and go into ‘19 and beyond that we are well-positioned not just to continue to perform across all sectors, but also drive additional growth through the additional expansion of our available markets. Hey, Harlan, it’s Bren. The other thing I would add is that it helps to offset some of the impact that bringing us, when you bring new capability to market, customers want to try to use that capability and so there is – that becomes pretty attractive to them. It also brings favorable economics with each generation. So even if they don’t need the capability, there is a cost of ownership improvement that comes with new generations of products. So, even if they don’t need the capability, they tend to – there is an economic motive as well. So to Rick’s point, it’s important for our competitive positioning to maintain the cadence that’s far ahead of what our competitors are doing, but it also provides an opportunity for customers to leverage the capability and for us to offset the impact of some of those kinds of things. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question with the adoption of ASC 606, can you still manage your business to a 6-month backlog that’s always been a core part of offering great visibility etcetera. So, curious what the ramifications are of this change in accounting standard? Yes, I know it’s a good question, C.J. I think around the 6-month backlog in terms of orders to shipment, you will see us continue to manage within that window. I’d ideally like to have that down closer to 5 versus 6. Where we will see the impact of 606 is that you will see revenue come to the P&L sooner, the standards around qualifying for revenue from a shipment perspective, you will have more shipments effectively becoming revenue sooner. So, where we will have with the consolidated customer base you have more – potentially more volatility in the revenue number. We increased the range a little bit as a result of potentially that factor, because it does reduce the daylight between shipments and revenue. But for our business, it should stay relatively consistent I talked to some of the principle changes in the prepared remarks, but in terms of how we manage lead times from order to shipment that part of our business won’t change. Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up typically I guess in terms of new capacity as you guys outperformed and so as we look at your second half outperformance for the guide, is that indicative of capacity adds that we should start to see layering it and starting Q4, Q1, Q2, is that a majority of it or is it more leverage to mask and wafer inspection where the full industry won’t benefit from that, anyway to sort of help us understand the moving parts there? Yes. So, there are a lot of moving parts, meaning you are right, I mean, reticle and wafer will have those businesses are ramping and so that will have an impact into the first part of the year. The shipments into China, I don’t expect that to abate. That’s been fairly consistent obviously big projects which seems like over the course of this year we have had our project to quarter pretty much. So we will see how that plays out as you move into the next phases there. We are seeing foundry logics start to come back in the second half profile and that – and if you look at the order mix that I think is a pretty good harbinger for what we expect to see into the first part of next year in terms of the bigger contribution from those segments. So I think that I wish I can give you more, but it is a bit of an all of the above answer, but clearly, there are aspects to Rick’s point earlier of the ramp around wafer and mask that is a bit unique to K-T. Very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question and Bren, thanks for the color on the September shipments. I just had a question it looks like your memory numbers in calendar Q3 are in line with your peers you are seeing a nice snapback in foundry. Can you just tell us, give us some color on what’s driving those foundry shipments, is it one customer or is it across multiple customers and along the same path in December, the snapback you are seeing in memory is it driven by DRAM or NAND? And I just had a follow-up after that. So on the foundry side, it’s – I mean we are seeing foundry logic both come back and so you got multiple customers investing there, but certainly on the foundry side of one customer is investing more than others. On the – I am just taking a quick look here, so in September we would expect it to be slightly weighted to DRAM of the memory mix. Got it. And then as a follow-up question, I just wanted to find out is there a way – can you guys say how much of your total sales is exposed to EUV at this point, is there a way to quantify that and also the bare wafer inspection business has been pretty strong for a couple of quarters, how sustainable do you think this is? Thank you. We don’t really quantified around the EUV participation, but I would say it’s on the order of 5% to 10% depending on how you look at it. And certainly there is development work that’s going on, that will scale. We do think the process control intensity around EUV is similar to what process control intensity is for non-EUV which means as EUV costs go up for scanners the process control will scale with that, so that it is definitely consistent trend. And Chris what was the second part of your question? The sustainability of the bare wafer inspection business? To the Rick’s comments in the prepared remarks, I mean we are seeing significant investment there both being driven by the strong memory environment. You have got increasing flatness specs. You have got cleanliness specs that are driving investments from the IC manufacturers. To support all that you have the wafer manufacturers also investing. So they have to deliver wafers. They have under invested for a number of years and so you are seeing new investment there against new specs. So I would expect those numbers to continue to be strong as we move certainly through this year and through next year as well. And as long as there is significant investment in memory from a WFE perspective, we are going to see that business participate pretty strongly. Thanks Rick. Thanks Bren. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Yes, great. Thank you so much. Fundamentals in the flat panel display industry have certainly deteriorated since you announced the Orbotech deal, so Rick I wanted to ask if your view on that part of the industry has changed long-term? Well, we always said it’s through cycle mentality looking at the businesses that Orbotech was in, that hasn’t changed. And we are not really in a position to talk about their business yet, but in terms of the strategic nature of that deal we feel very good about the original thesis and all the subsequent work we have done so far with that team. We are very excited about putting the two together and obviously we will have a lot more to say once we finished the regulatory process. Understood. And then secondly Bren you talked a little bit about service margins improving in the September quarter and that to some extent offsetting the decline in margins on the products side, can you elaborate on that point and talk to sustainability and service margins? Thank you. Sure. I mean there were minor changes there. I mean one of the good things we are seeing in China in-service now that we have invested pretty significantly in China to add resources to support all of that business both to be able to ramp those fabs and then support them over time. And as you know they are geographically pretty dispersed. So between the field resources, but also infrastructure to support all that activity we have been investing pretty significantly over the last 12 months to 18 months. We are now slowly completing that and so we are starting to see the incremental margins flow through on service. So I would expect one good thing about the consolidated customer base is we are able to get to leverage service infrastructures certainly in certain places like in China or not well maybe the investments in China, but in Korea or in Taiwan we are able to try to leverage those resources. So it’s a good story and I would expect to see service continued to be well. Obviously, it’s dilutive to our overall gross margins but the incremental offsets some of that ongoing dilution. But we believe the operating margin profile of business is certainly strong and accretive to the overall company. Thanks so much. Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your shipment by geography, Korea was really strong this past fiscal year, I am just trying to better understand, would you be able to quantitatively help me understand the mix maybe perhaps between memory and bare wafer? Almost of it is memory in Korea. I mean there is a little bare wafer, but most of it is memory. Okay, helpful. And then looking forward there are a couple of new fabs coming online Greenfield fabs and I am trying to assess how I should think about your new product and a scaling should we expect your revenue to or a percentage of your system revenue as a percentage of WFE finally to hit 10% plus as your design wins are scale especially for 3D NAND and two of these new fabs for 90 plus layer 3D NAND manufacturing and would that give you the opportunity to see a material increase in memory especially NAND? So we have been pretty pleased with the process control intensity improvement that we have seen in flash and so it’s been a good sign. I would expect that the new products if we can continue so our customer problems will continue to see some momentum there. It’s still about half of that what we see in foundry logic. So the intensity for lots of reasons is lower, but we are seeing incremental improvement. We have seen more metrology. We have new metrology products specifically targeted let’s say should help with that. So as we move forward with the increase in foundry logic mix, we would expect into next year really having an all time low this year. We would also expect that to influence the overall process control in terms of the percent of wafer, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in 3D NAND and if we can continue to execute hopefully there is more there for us. So Mehdi just to build on that, the challenge has not been available problems to solve, the challenge has been solutions which solve those problems and it’s not a competitive challenge for us, it’s just the feasibility, so it’s taken some time to work and collaborate with those customers to get new technologies to market really to address the verticalization of NAND. And we have very strong products in the pipeline addressing that. So we think calendar ‘19 we will see continued success with those initial penetrations and that will be the basis for driving additional percent of WFE out of memory. Okay. So one way or another it should move higher, right now it’s like 7% to 8% of WFE, it should move higher as…? Correct. Got it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the guiding in tough environment. Two questions on China, Rick my understanding is that the three key domestic Chinese product lines are almost done this year and the emphasis is to improve the yield, given your position in inspection market, can you just update us where the yield stand with those domestic projects and then what your expectations are for the volume business to come from those projects. And then as a follow-up, if you can also talk about tariffs and implications from tariffs on your supply chain or your business? Sure. The exciting thing is we have great partnerships with our customers in China looking at ramping retail facilities. And as you might imagine there is a lot of interest in our expertise and capability there, so we are partnered very closely and we have had a lot of executive exchanges as well as others. So we feel very good about our ability to support their new fabs in their ramp. I won’t get into the specific of the yields, but they are making progress. We are seeing the promise of additional investment based on the initial success that they are seeing and we feel very good about our position and enabling that as they go forward. And of course in this case it’s really across the product portfolio. In terms of the implications of tariffs, our supply chain isn’t based in China, so from a standpoint of our key components we are not really subject to that, obviously we have an eye out for other changes that could be coming. But as of this point, it does not have any impact on our business. And then Atif just in terms of the investment profile. I mean as we – just thinking about from an order perspective and there is a little bit more lead time to these orders because in a lot of cases, they are building new facilities. But we have seen remarkable stability. If you just go back in the last couple of years and even as we look forward of the business levels we are seeing in China. So this year we should book somewhere in the neighborhood and I said this before somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million or so from indigenous China and I would expect that level of investment to continue and we will see as start gating out, little ways of away from what things will look like as we move into ‘19 but all indications at this point give me confidence that we are going to continue to see this level of investment for these players as we move forward. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, Rick. Thanks for letting me asking questions. Congratulations on solid results. I think you guys talked about in your prepared comments the September shipments from logic being down around 5%, which I think is the second lowest and kind of our dataset at least. I am kind of curious as you think about the December recovery, is logic kind of helping bolster that view of a recovery in December, is it still just mostly memory? Hi, John. Bren here too. Yes, John, you are right I mean September is fairly weak, so we do see some bounce back in that segment. We also see bounce back in foundry. So, we do see the shifting profile of 40%ish or so of the shipment mix going to foundry logic into the second half of the year. So, yes, it looks like it’s going to bounce back, it looks like there is some sustainability to it into the first part of next year. That’s helpful. And then Rick it’s nice to see that despite the fact that WFE is mixing slightly more towards memory this year than last year, but you guys are still significantly outgrowing WFE. I am curious to what extent do you think that’s just better leveraged to memory versus kind of EUV playing out this year and you talked about kind of the process intensity of NAND, how should we think about 1Y and 1Z on the DRAM front? So, I think the part that’s maybe a little misunderstood and we need to do a better job explaining it is things like the wafer manufacturer is there is high capital intensity of inspection and metrology for those and they are really feeding the memory guys. So, it’s probably the case that our intensity around memory is higher than the way it’s traditionally thought of. So, we are seeing a lot of benefit in the demands that are placed on wafers as they moved to new technologies in memory, because of the cleanliness and also the flatness. So that’s actually been a boost. And as you point out on the EUV factor is still there and then lastly we would say the process control intensity in China has been supportive of the overall business environment for us as we have great positions there and in their early stages of trying to ramp new facilities. So I think all of those factors have come together to give us a very nice 2018 and what looks like a very strong 2019. Perfect. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is now open. Hi, great job guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the foundry side, you mentioned that there is improvement on foundry shipments from September to December, if I calculate correctly second half is actually really strong versus first half, is it all driven by 7-nanometer or are you seeing that demand year-over-year and then just kind of tied to [indiscernible], should we expect a much higher level of Gen-5 adoption in 5-nanometer versus 7, can you kind of talk about the Gen-5 progress? I think there is couple of ways to think about it. It’s early for 5, but EUV activity drives a lot of the business in the mouse shop. And so we are seeing the benefit from that in terms of our business in mask is doing quite well. Also wafer manufacturers are very supportive of bringing in new capabilities. So we are seeing that as a driver. And then you do see Gen-5 and you see actually some of the metrology tools too in support of the new nodes, so I think it’s really a combination of those factors that gives us the diversification of reach across to the customers and is really driving the general outperform. Yes, I think the other thing that’s happening is as you are seeing an increase in 7-nanometer tape-outs moving through the foundries and so a) that’s driving certain reticle capability, not just writers, but then inspectors from us, but we would expect to follow-on capacity additions to support that business. As we move into ‘19 you start to see some of that investment around 5-nanometer development. Certainly, Gen-5 plays a bigger role in that. I would expect that business to grow next year versus this year just driven by some of these dynamics. Great. That was extremely helpful. And then just a question on the OpEx and maybe I guess operating leverage on the model, Bren, do you think you can sustain OpEx at this level, it seems like December you can grow quite a bit and it sounds like you guys upbeat at least in the first half of ‘19, do you think you can maintain OpEx at this level or just grow OpEx, can you talk about that? Yes. I would think the OpEx is going to trend in line with the model that we published. So we are operating about 50 to 100 basis points above that model for these revenue levels given the commentary we provided around next year, it sort of fits within that. So I would see the OpEx scaling a little bit in line with the models we have published. We try to drive incremental margins, certainly greater than 40% target, 40% to 50% on our incremental margins. So there is a number of new programs we are investing in, new platforms supporting EUV, supporting extra metrology. So, in addition to a couple of things that we just recently announced and there is follow-on activity around those. So I would expect us to continue to invest. We are going to deliver to the model we have been public with and we are going to continue to try to drive leverage through. But given the level of business we are seeing, I feel pretty good about the sustainability of our investment profile. Great. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open. Thank you very much. And Rick, I appreciate the color you have given on some of the increasing capital intensity trends on the memory side. Maybe as a follow-up to John’s question earlier about DRAM and the 1X and 1Y, you talked about the cleanliness and some of the issues there. As the DRAM ministry moves to 1Y and you see a lot more of these multi-patterning steps and even some of the process change where they could come, I guess more logic like, is that also helping to increase the process control intensity given that they are more logic like and obviously those – that that’s been your key bread-and-butter for the years? Well, certainly, we are seeing interest and some adoption of Gen-5 in the DRAM guys as they look at 1Y. So absolutely we are seeing that. And that wasn’t necessarily originally anticipated the degree with which we have seen that strength, but it just – it kind of goes to the point of the desire to get more capability in there and the fact that the coverage matters quite a bit. So we have just placed some interest that people have had at e-beam for those applications with Gen-5. So we feel very good about that. And we are definitely getting indications that there is more to come there. It’s not just that, it’s also registration, so if you think about DRAM and the challenges it has for registration we see more adoption there as well. So we feel very good about the trends that we are seeing in memory as well. So Patrick we are encouraged – we are trying to be a little more conservative in terms of how we model it just given the historic behavior from these customers what we deliver, believe we can deliver any capability here around some of these problems as that’s an opportunity for us. Most of the context that provide around performance and intensity levels is based on little improvement there, so if we can drive improvement in process control intensity that’s an opportunity for us to deliver incremental upside sort of the base model about how we are running the business over the next few years. Right. And Bren, maybe as my follow-up question in terms of services, you talked about 75% of your revenues are coming from I guess the service contract today, but unlike process tools which in many cases can eke themselves up and it just becomes a kind of recurring revenue stream of replacing parts. Can you give a little color of the type of value-added solution or some of the product enhancement that process control can offer and how that can grow? Well, I mean certainly the contract profile that you got it pretty well, where there is a limited number of these tools, they are very important to keep them up and customers want to contract structure to ensure that the uptime and availability is there. And so the 75% certain level of contract as a percent of the total has been fairly consistent at that level. So, we feel very good about the sustainability of that over time as they stretch the installed base. We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell incremental enhancements to the installed base. As you know that there is a lot of trailing edge activity that’s happening to support automotive and IoT, they are running those older fabs and the installed base much harder. So, there is incremental demand for those customers to not only drive higher uptime for their tools, which is driving the business, but also to buy enhancements to the current installed base and those fabs are full, so it’s not like in some cases you can move in extra tools, you are going to add incremental capability to the existing school, whether it’s speed or increased sensitivity. So, we are pursuing and looking at those opportunities and given that the stratification of demand for semi, it creates an interesting opportunity for us going forward. And maybe a very significant difference between process control, service business and process business, is the availability of alternative suppliers for consumables. So if you are in a process company, you have that threat of outside sources providing consumables, process control, we have a very strong position to enable and make this equipment continue to perform as is designed and that’s really a big part of the value proposition. So they are different businesses. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions. Your largest foundry customer in Taiwan talked about improving manufacturing efficiencies. From your experience with them, do their CapEx cut impacting all the equivalent types equally or do you think that will impact you guys less because process control is more front-end loaded. And clearly your guidance for September quarter is very good do you think it is more than offset by their spending on 7 nanometers in EUV? Well, I think there is two sides of it. One, we like to believe we enable better capital efficiency by helping customers get more value out of the rest of their tools. On the other hand, of course, every customer is trying to manage all their costs and work across the products to extend and reuse. And as Bren said, one of the keys to our success is to continually bring out new products and new capabilities as a counter. What you have clearly got to show is continued improvement and cost of ownership performance, which means more capability. So, I think the answer is kind of both. I think you definitely see a push from all of our customers to enhance their sustainability of their investment and by doing that drive efficiency and we enabled that and we also try to support it by driving new capabilities. Okay, great. My follow-up question is related to China, can you talk about your shipment strength in China this quarter, this June quarter. About a year ago, you talked about China as the region has the potential of SAM for process control for about $5 billion between 2017 and 2020, given your comment that Chinese manufacturers seems to have high process control intensity, do you think that estimate is higher, lower is just about the same? I think it’s too early to say. I mean we have seen in the same time we have seen some softening in the forecast for the sort of wafer outs in China. So I don’t know that we could speculate on that. We are pleased with the production that the support in the business that we have got in China, but I would say if they meet their published goals, then we will exceed that target. However, I think there are some definite challenges that they have got in terms of scaling those factories over time in the next couple of years. Alright, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. One more on China, so shipments there were 32% of total versus 18% kind of level, were there anyone off and I think somewhere during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect China to stay around the $600 million contribution level next year, so kind of flat. I just wanted to confirm I heard that right? You did. I mean, that’s an order level. And so what actually – how much actually shifts and revenues may deviate a bit, although we have been – things have been pretty consistent in and around that level. So that’s a reasonable number to use as you think moving forward. And if you look last quarter there was significant vertical NAND project that we ship to this quarter, there is a significant DRAM project, it’s not all the business, but certainly a big part of it. Got it. And then on the services side, is there a backlog number we should keep in mind or I guess often a different way, if we assume that WFE is conceptually flat next year, can you still grow your services business at a double-digit base? I mean, the way the service business generally works is you have booking shipments in the same quarter. There is some extended warranty backlog, but it’s pretty minor. So there isn’t a backlog number, but it’s continuous in terms of the contracts that we signed and then we get the POs that are consistent with those contracts. But the other thing that contributes to it, if you think about the installed base and how long it lasts, one of the things driving, if you will, IoT or automotive is found to be utilizing longer, customers wanting more capability, wanting both enhancements and also those tools to run longer. So, the decay rate of what we would have originally modeled of tools coming off contract is slower and that’s how you can drive growth even in a flat systems shipment business, which we don’t think ours will be flat by the way even if WFE is flat, we are going to grow this year. So, we think there is still lot of energy left in the sustainability of the growth in services. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks for the follow-up. Given how far behind China is in terms of mainstream technology adoption, given that they do have a track record of higher process control intensity, have you guys seen any Gen-5 pull-ins from China, which may help them to accelerate the yield learning? And then just a quick follow-up in terms of keeping the product pipeline healthy, can you just give us an update on the multi-column e-beam EUV reticle inspection platform, is that still on track for introduction next year? Boy, those are our two very different questions, Harlan. So, in terms of the indigenous China projects, we have not seen demand yet for Gen-5 for those projects that we think that’s down the road for the guys that are doing memory, that’s something that certainly we could envision down the road once as you say. Right now, that’s not really their focus nor at this point is that their need we can satisfy with the number of the products that we already have. In terms of the multi-beam product, we continue to make investment, we continue to work through some of the technical hurdles and we have a lot of closed engagements with our customers on that and there is clearly a lot of customer interest, but I won’t go beyond that at this point. Great. Thank you. There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call over back to you.

The September quarter results also show the company is benefiting from our strategies for market leadership and revenue diversification. Furthermore, they demonstrate their critical nature of process control and enabling technology inflections in the semiconductor industry, including growth markets such as vertical NAND, EUV adoption and the China semiconductor industry.
And with the expected closing this quarter of the Orbotech acquisition, KLA-Tencor will further extend its market reach in the electronics value chain, enhancing the company’s product and services portfolio beyond our core and WFE to address new growth markets where technological complexity is rising and where KLA can extend its core competencies into exciting new opportunities.
Now for some perspective on the current industry demand environment, first, notwithstanding, the recent adjustments in capacity investment for memory customers and delays in logic spend from the second half of 2018 into 2019, we believe the long-term factors underpinning demand in the wafer fab equipment industry remain sound. This is the result of several key elements, including more diversified end markets for semiconductor.
The ongoing commitment of customers to driving innovation and leading-edge technology roadmaps, disciplined market-driven capacity planning and the high levels of investment required to address increased design complexity and advanced device architectures. We expect these industry drivers will persist in delivering long-term growth and value creation opportunities for the company, the industry and for all our stakeholders.
Moving now to the recent highlights that demonstrate successful execution of the company’s strategic focus on technology and market leadership, first, as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable growth of the semiconductor industry in China.
Memory and foundry manufacturers in this region are investing in a high level to accelerate process development and yield learning. We expect momentum in China to continue in 2019 and beyond with customers progressing their technology roadmaps and ramping new production capacity in the initial phase of a multiyear investment cycle.
Additionally, over the past several quarters, we have seen exceptional demand for bare waver and mask inspection products. Growth in our mask inspection business is consistent with planned increases in CapEx from the leading foundries as these customers ramp 7-nanometer capacity to support a high number of customer tapeouts at this node and begin aggressive development of 5-nanometer, including EUV development.
In bare wafer, KLA’s market-leading inspection and metrology tools are key enablers of the growth in wafer supply to address capacity expansion in memory. These products are also essential in helping customers in all segments to meet more stringent design specification for wafer flatness and cleanliness.
And finally, KLA-Tencor service business continues to be a highlight. Going forward, it is on a trajectory to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit annual revenue growth with low business volatility consistent with historical trends.
Long-term growth and services is tied to expansion of the installed base, as well as from the increasing uptime requirements from current node production and at the trailing edge. Trailing edge fabs are currently running at near full utilization, creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades.
In summary, before I turn the call over to Bren, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding performance in the September quarter, driven by the company’s strong execution and market leadership.
Given our momentum in the marketplace, diversified growth markets and the critical role the company’s products and services play in enabling customer success, we are positioned for a strong finish in 2018.
I’d now like to turn the call over to Bren for his review of the financial results. Bren? Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, gross margin and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter.
Revenue was $1.09 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.46. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was a discrete tax benefit taken in the quarter related to new guidance affecting our adoption of the new tax law in the United States.
As a reminder, since this is the first quarter of our new fiscal year 2019, our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, all revenue commentary in our results and guidance exclusively reflect our adoption of the new standard and we do not plan to provide any color related to the financial results under the previous standard.
In today’s press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.
Now for highlights for the -- of the September demand environment in terms of shipments, total shipments were $1.007 billion, above the $975 million midpoint and at the top-end of guidance for the quarter, driven by strength in memory and an expected sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in a range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, consistent with the update we provided in early September.
Our current outlook is for shipments in the first half of calendar 2019 to be modestly higher compared with the second half of 2018. The shipment profile in the first half of 2019 is expected to show accelerating momentum from foundry customers driven by 7-nanometer design starts and 5-nanometer development activity, consistent investment from logic customers and a balanced mix in memory.
Memory was 57% of shipments in September. DRAM accounted for 26% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory to be strong again in this quarter and approximately 64% of total shipments.
Foundry was 38% of shipments in the September quarter and is forecasted to be about 22% of the total in December. Logic shipments were 5% of the total in Q3 and the current outlook is for logic to be 14% in December.
The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 27%, patterning includes shipments reticle inspection, service 22% and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.
I will turn now to the income statement. Revenue was $1.09 billion in September and finishing at the top-end of the range of guidance. We expect December revenue to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.11 billion for the quarter.
Gross margin was 65.2% and also at the top-end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving the strong gross margin performance in September were consistent with recent margin trends, with the upside largely driven by product mix. In December, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% as a slightly weaker product mix is offset by higher service and manufacturing efficiencies.
Total operating expenses were $263 million in September, as non-headcount engineering program investments were lower than expected in the quarter due to timing issues related to prototype materials.
We expect to incur those expenses in the December quarter, as we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $275 million at the midpoint, with variability around this operating expense level driven principally by the timing of these types of program development costs.
Looking forward for the next several quarters, we are modeling quarterly operating expenses in the $270 million to $275 million range, based on planned program -- product development requirements and our current topline expectations. Operating margin in September was 41.1%.
The effective tax rate was an 11.3% in the quarter and below the 15% long-term tax planning rate as business mix and further implementation of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in the U.S. impacted our rate. We will provide an update to the planning rate for the company inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition when we report results for the December quarter.
Finally, net income for the quarter was $384 million and we ended the quarter with 156.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the December quarter, you should model share count at approximately 153 million.
I will turn now to highlight for the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.8 billion. Cash from operations was $381 million and free cash flow was $359 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $123 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully-vested restricted stock units and repurchased 300 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.
We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization and expect to complete this program over the next few quarters, consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional 1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.
Finally, in regards to the adoption of ASC 606, please refer to our 10-Q filing for a detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition under the new and legacy standards. These differences are largely driven by timing of revenue recognition, principally due to and control the products’ transfers to the customer.
Under ASC 606, we see reduction in the time period between shipment and revenue recognition compared to the previous standard. Based on the product and customer mix in our current shipment and revenue forecasts, we expect reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable for calendar ‘18 and in the range of 2.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The difference in revenue recognition between ASC 606 and the legacy standard could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but will narrow over a multiple quarter time horizon.
In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor in the September quarter reflect the company’s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer’s growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model.
As the market leader in process control coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value to stockholders.
With that to summarize guidance for the December quarter is, shipments in the range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.88 per share to $2.20 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS at $2.02 per share to $2.34 per share.
Before turning the call over for your questions, I’d like to announce we have scheduled an Investor Day for March 6, 2019 in New York City. Please circle that date on your calendars and keep an eye out for further details and a formal invite in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you all in New York.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we’d like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today’s call as time permits.
All right, Chantal, we are ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Thank you much. Hi, guys. I had two. First of all, I am sure you saw the news today about the export restrictions to Jinhua, which is one of the three big memory fabs of course being built this was shipping to this year. So my first question is, does this sort of change how you think about your business next year, it seems to be a little more surgical than sort of likely to spread to be a big broad export restriction, but I am curious of your thoughts? Thanks. Hey, Tim. This is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 19 -- ‘18 or what we are looking at a ‘19 based on the expectation we had from that customer. To your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously, other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today it does not change our view. Yeah. Tim, I think, as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we have shipped there and closing on that business. There’s some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don’t think it changes in a material way anyway of how we are really thinking about the business going forward. Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Bren, service was up a lot, it was up 26% year-over-year, a big inflection. I guess, my question is, are you doing something different in service that caused a big inflection and can service grow that much year-over-year in December and then as you get in the first half of next year? Thank you. No. Tim, that’s a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we will file in the next couple of days.
But what we are doing here is that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation.
Historically, with the cost accrual, so what happened is, we have reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we have added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th.
So it’s a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward.
But you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we will see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically.
So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations. Awesome, guys. Thank you so much. Thank you. Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Bren, maybe to follow-up just on Tim’s question there, relative to your view that first half of ‘19 should be higher than second half of ‘18. If you could elaborate a little bit about what’s driving that views. How much of a benefit is 606. Is the expectation that the memory adjustments are now behind you or is -- are you still seeing memory uncertainty but logic and foundry has really given you that confidence, any color there would be helpful? Hey. John, it’s Bren. So those were shipments’ statements, not revenue and I think it’s an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric, which is why we are continuing to provide not only actual results and context, but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that.
So as we move into this first half, I think, that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance.
So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year. I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan. But -- and I am not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it’s March or June, but as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that’s how we are seeing the first half play out at least at this point in terms of shipments. That’s helpful. And maybe as my follow up just relative to all the consternation and concern about memory. It was interesting to hear you say that you believe memory shipments as a percent of overall shipments will grow sequentially in the December quarter. Rick, I wondering you just talk to what extent that that’s rising sort of intensity of what you do in the memory market versus just timing of projects, any help on sort of the rising intensity would be helpful? It’s the intensity has stepped up but it’s more consistent with what we have seen over the last year. Remember we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products, which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment.
So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we have seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement.
So I think it’s more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves. Perfect. Thanks, guys. Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, first one, just to follow up on China. It looks like you guys are not worried too much about the export control impacting your customer or at least your shipments to China so that’s kind of good to know. Is there a way to quantify either, I think, you had said in the past how indigenous China bookings are in the $600 million range for this year or as a percentage of sales like 25% of system sales was China. Is there a way to quantify what it was for the September quarter and then I had a follow up? Yeah. Krish, let me take the first part, and then, let Bren answer. We are not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that that let’s just be clear on that. Thanks. Yeah. Krish, so shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China and that, I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn’t a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably, a little bit, but not a lot.
And consistently, as we have looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we are seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry centric, a little bit more foundry centric and material centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective, but generally, we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers.
And to the earlier point, I think, we feel, okay, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation, and as we said earlier, we don’t think it has much effect on how we are running the business or planning for it into next year. Got it. Got it. Thank you very much. That’s very helpful. And then just as a follow up, your commentary on first half shipments and the fact that next year it would be more weighted towards foundry and logic. Is it fair to assume that, I mean, without any guidance like calendar ‘19 revenue should grow over calendar ‘18 and given it’s more weighted to foundry/logic. The margin profile or EPS should be better than sales. Is that a fair enough assumption? So, I will make a couple of comments around ‘19 and the first is, we do expect foundry/logic to be up in ‘19 versus ‘18 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus ‘18 -- the second half of ‘18. So we will have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that’s how we see it right now.
You are right. Those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base. I don’t think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business.
But, certainly, that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we are encouraged by that. We will see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year. Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick. Thanks. Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Good Afternoon. Good job on the quarterly execution guys and strong free cash flow. Yes or no, talked about shipping 30 EUV systems next year, that’s up from about 18 this year. So the EUV adoption curve is here and it look like it’s a pretty aggressive ramp. You guys are supporting that with your mask inspection, blank inspection, CD overlay Gen 5, print check portfolios. So outside of yes or no, you guys are probably one of the bigger beneficiary, there is EUV ramps and given that ramp adoption next year, can you guys just quantify your EUV related opportunity next year and does this help the team sort of sustain that sort of 64% or 65% gross margin profile maybe into next year? Hi, Harlan. It’s Rick. I will take the first part and then Bren will follow up. Let me start with -- we don’t break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it.
And as you mentioned, we are seeing good business and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there’s also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face.
So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don’t break it out in particular and we are a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won’t really change if it’s the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It’s really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren, you can break up the second part. So on gross margins, Harlan, I think, as we look at next year this and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level, product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter. But in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that’s how things are trending right now.
Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So, but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins that’s generally the right place to be. Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on your Gen 5 pattern wafer inspection system, I think, you guys have said, anticipated 17 systems, 18 systems in the field by the end of this year, did you guys hit that target and how do you guys see the momentum of Gen 5 going into next year, just given the sharp ramp of EUV, the start of 5-nanometer EUV foundry and 7-nanometer EUV logic development activities? Yes. Harlan, we did hit our target. So we are consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on, we would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in ‘19 versus what we saw in ‘18. And in terms of momentum, it’s playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that will drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they will spend a lot of time trying to figure it out and then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out.
So when we model those, it’s not just the number of systems, it’s where they are located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development.
So we like the momentum of the product, we are finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we are feeling very good about how we are positioned as we go forward in 2019. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, you have mentioned the potential for first half ‘19 orders to slightly grow half over half. How sensitive is that to assumption of where memory prices will trend? So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders, and I think, right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we are seeing is it doesn’t seem to necessarily be pricing dependent, obviously, that does influence how they think about overall supply.
But we have seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through ‘18 and those pushes into ‘19. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of ‘19 from a shipment perspective, and as I said, modestly up versus the second half of ‘18. Got it. And for my follow up, just a question on inventories, they are higher than what we have seen historically. Can you give us some sense of what the range should for whether it’s days or dollars or what have you over the next several quarters? Thank you. You are right. It’s a good question and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long lead time products that are in the queue, namely the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we are seeing for that tool and those are long lead times so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early.
We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we are spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you work -- we are working with newer suppliers and so, we are buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year.
So, all those things are driving the inventory levels higher. As we move over then that I would expect based on what we are seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we will see that number flatten out and that will be -- that’s a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out.
So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we have got the products in position so we can ramp them and that’s where we see in our financials is in the inventory build. Thank you. Your next question comes from the CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, back on deferred revenues. It looks like that ticked up from June to September by $300 plus million. So is that the kind of number we should be thinking about in terms of an increase for deferred in fiscal ‘19 versus fiscal ‘18?
And as a second part to that, should we be thinking about deferred being isolated to certain long lead time or newer products and are there certain gross margins associated with those products vis-à-vis the rest of your mix? Yeah. CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down. One thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605, which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606 we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down.
I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier, which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn’t anything in particular that’s -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and it’s first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on.
But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way, and then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that’s what’s happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics. Very helpful. And as a follow-up, as you think about just the Jinhua ruling from the Department of Commerce. How are you thinking if at all that could impact MOFCOM and their willingness to sign off on your acquisition of Orbotech? We have not -- we have had dialog and discussions and we are proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we are having and we believe we are on track to close that out this calendar year, so as we have said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade. Good to hear. Thank you. Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rick, you called out at Foundry 5-nanometer as one of the potential drivers heading into first half of ‘19 and I realize it’s really early. But how do you think about that node in terms of contribution to your business over the next couple of years? Well, I mean, I think, it will be a continuation of the expansion we have seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that that’s the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7, but 5 is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use.
So we are well positioned for now. We are working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we have had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool, if you go back a year ago and now it’s becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well. In the first part of next year we will see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- customers currently talking about we will see that drive up some activity, we are seeing in the mask shop, we will see it in the wafer fab as well and we will start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move towards the second half of the year.
As Rick said, it’s a challenging node, it’s a bigger node for EUV and we have got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think, it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year. Great. And then as a quick follow up, on bare wafer inspection, I think, this is another segment or product group rather that you guys have called out over the past couple, if not several quarters. I realize it’s a high margin business for you guys. I think some of your customers or all of your customers remain pretty constructive in the 2018, I am sorry, 2019 in terms of their outlook in terms of pricing, but some of them have toned it down a little bit, just given the weakness in memory and in certain parts of logic. How sustainable do you think this business is for you? I ask, because, in the past, I think, it’s been pretty volatile for you guys? Thank you. We are certainly in a period where there’s both there’s kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there’s capacity expansion, there’s technological challenges associated with these activity and there’s increased flatness requirements.
So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we are modeling as we go forward is, we don’t see that level of growth going forward again where we have essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit. But the sustainability of the current levels is what we are modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability.
And remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading edge and so we will be feathering in our products and support of that.
So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don’t see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node. Thanks so much. Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow up to your comments on the memory market lease in the near-term, when you are discussing about a balanced memory market, does that include the combination of DRAM and NAND or are you seeing one or the other potentially driving the first half of ‘19 outlook that you detailed? So that’s the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it’s a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don’t really have much more to say than that.
I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion and so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen. Yeah. And we don’t just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM Investment in ‘19 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so. But as Bren said it’s -- that’s not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned. Great. That’s helpful. And maybe, Rick, as a follow up in terms of China and the indigenous market, particularly on the trailing edge foundry logic segment that’s been a surprising strength for the entire industry in 2018. From a process control intensity standpoint, do you believe the local semiconductor manufacturers on the foundry logic side are seeing the value and this will then continue as they continue to migrate down nodes in the future or I guess, I am a little surprised that there has been so much strength coming out of there given that they can reuse tool or buy used tools in the marketplace? They have a -- there’s another process challenges I think that they are facing even though they have as you say that there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage.
But it’s harder when you are relatively new and your scale isn’t as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you have seen in the other places. So they are also tackling a number of technology challenges at once.
We have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business. On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they are significantly smaller, as I said, than what you’d see elsewhere.
So, I think, it continues to be strong, I do think there’s even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you will continuously strength. Ultimately they’d like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that’s several years away before that would be a significant piece of that. Well, they also are challenged to get used equipment, it’s a pretty tight market out there and we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don’t really have in any of that in inventory. So what we have done is we have restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are de-configured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they are investing that way, and to Rick’s point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they will be able to get to a place where they can do that. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on the use of EUV for DRAM, when you think it gets implemented on DRAM and how you guys could benefit from that? Well, I think, that the, you are going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think, and that’s going to be the big challenge. But I think we are going to see some in 2019 beyond what we have seen in pilot in 2018.
It’s really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop, obviously, with DRAM, you don’t have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall.
But I think it’s much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they are trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So it’s a driver, but not as much as it is, of course, than logic. Okay. And then on China in a nuclear winter scenario where, let’s say, there are broad restrictions put on equipment suppliers to ship equipment to China. Do you think this spending will just get absorbed elsewhere in Korea or Taiwan or in other fab infrastructure there to take the demand? Boy that’s -- it’s hard to speculate on that. But I would think there’s clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons, and therefore, it’s more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think, you’d probably see some impact.
We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So we are not modeling that as one of the outcomes. But, yes, I think, that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure. Operator, we are ready for next question. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the service revenue, want to make sure that, you talk about it takes a few quarters for the revenue recognition to formalize. So should we think about by the end of this fiscal year, you will get back to a longer term trend of, say, 9% to 10% year-over-year? Yes. Yeah. No. That’s a good way to think about it, because you are going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So there are some tools that are shipped right at the end of that quarter. So it will take a year for that to completely roll-off, although, it’s likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That’s a good way to think about it. Okay. Great. My second question is that, in the past you have talked about trailing edge is now close to 40% of your revenues. Some of the foundries have you talked about overcapacity of 28 nanometers wafers and utilization may come down. Do you expect that to be a short-term phenomenon and do you expect next year you will see trailing edge going back to 40% of the revenues? It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around as its more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we are seeing. I’d see it being fairly stable. We will have to watch those markets and see. But at least at this point, that’s how it looks to us. Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they are not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient and we are seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too. Great. Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood. Thank you, Chantal. No further commentary from us today. Thank you all for joining. This concludes our conference call. This concludes today’s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation Investor Relations. You may begin you conference. Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31st, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.
As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. KLA reported excellent results for the December quarter, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each closing above the range of guidance in the period. The December quarter caps the third consecutive year of mid-teens revenue growth for KLA. The consistent, strong financial performance we are delivering is a result of our continued customer collaboration, product innovation and outstanding operational excellence.
Our performance also highlights the strength and resilience of the KLA business model and the company's ability to consistently deliver long-term growth while delivering top-tier financial performance and strong cash returns to stockholders.
Consistent with this vision and with an eye to the future, on January 10, we unveiled the new name and logo for KLA Corporation. Our new, more contemporary brand honors the legacy of KLA's past and reflects our vision of the future for employees and for partners.
Now for some perspective on today's market dynamics. In terms of our view of the current WFE demand climate, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for a down year for the equipment investment in 2019, largely driven by meaningful declines in memory spend in both segments, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in advanced foundry and logic.
However, notwithstanding the near term market headwinds currently impacting WFE investment, the long term growth dynamics for the industry remains strong, fueled by larger and more diversified semiconductor device end demand and disciplined market-driven capacity planning.
The reduction in memory capacity investment we are seeing today is a result of weaker mobile demand and a pullback in data center. However, we expect supply and demand to rebalance over time given a more rational and disciplined capacity investment posture by customers.
In contrast to memory, leading edge foundry and logic investments have begun to ramp and momentum is expected to continue in 2019, reasonably balanced through the year with customers investing to support transitions to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography. For KLA, we have already seen our mix of business shifting to logic and foundry and investment from these customers is expected to remain strong in 2019.
Now for some highlights of our market leadership and product differentiation strategies. KLA continues to experience significant growth in demand for our wafer and mask inspection products driven by tighter wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market and the introduction of both EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops.
We're also seeing strong customer acceptance of recently released new products, including the revolutionary new Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms. Both products are being adopted in volume at multiple customer sites, demonstrating that our long-term R&D investments and product strategies are meeting market requirements and enabling customers to progress their advanced technology road maps.
KLA's service business also continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while generating strong cash flow. Service is expected to exceed $1 billion in calendar '19 and deliver long term annual revenue growth rates in the 9% to 11% range.
Growth in services is tied to a number of factors, including expansion of the installed base and more end demand for legacy applications, driving higher utilization of capacity and extension of useful life.
These are just a couple of examples of how our strategies for technology and market leadership are delivering results. As we move ahead in the new year, we remain focused on advancing our long-term strategies, positioning the company for success and continuing to deliver strong financial performance and long-term stockholder value.
To conclude before handing the call over to Bren, I'd like to give a quick update on the status of the Orbotech transaction. KLA and Orbotech are continuing to work cooperatively on approval of our transaction with the Chinese antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and we're finalizing discussions with them.
We expect to receive China regulatory approval this quarter. Given the timeliness and sensitivity of these discussions, we will forgo any further discussions and will not answer additional questions regarding the transaction until we have new developments to discuss.
This concludes my comments for today. Now I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren? Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance in the quarter.
Revenue was $1.12 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.44 in the December quarter. In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.
As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.
Now for highlights on the December demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were a record $1.09 billion, above the range of guidance for the quarter. The upside to our shipping guidance was a result of pull-ins of approximately $65 million of deliveries originally scheduled for the March quarter. As a result of these pull-ins, the shipment results for the second half of calendar '18 were essentially flat with the first half.
Our outlook for March quarter shipments is in the range of $860 million to $940 million, with the quarterly sequential decline in shipments a function of these pull-ins into the December quarter as well as the shift in delivery dates from two memory customers that occurred very late in December.
Though visibility in the industry today is challenging and customer plans remain fluid, particularly in memory, our current view is for the second half 2019 shipments to be greater than the first half, a result of the factors I just discussed and our latest customer delivery expectations for 2019.
Memory was 61% of semiconductor shipments in December. DRAM accounted for 38% of system shipments. We expect memory to be approximately 40% of shipments in the March quarter. Foundry was 24% of shipments in the December quarter and is forecasted to be about 50% of the total in March.
Logic shipments were 15% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 10% of shipments in March. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 28%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 21%, and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.
I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.12 billion in December and $50 million above the midpoint of guidance. We expect March revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $960 million. March revenue levels are lower than we expected back in October.
As highlighted in our recent earnings reports, the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition means that quarterly revenue levels are now more closely tied to quarterly shipments. Due to this dynamic, the shipment pull-ins we experienced in December have led to meaningful revenue upside in the quarter but at the expense of the March quarter. This coupled with the memory shipment delays I mentioned earlier, are lowering our revenue expectations for March.
Due to our record shipment backlog and expectations for system shipment scheduling for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the March quarter will be the low point and anticipate sequential revenue growth to resume in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of calendar year '19.
Gross margin was 63.6% in December, 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance as the modest improvement in product mix was offset by slightly higher manufacturing and service costs.
In March, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%, principally due to volume as manufacturing costs are spread across a lower revenue base. Product mix expectations are roughly consistent with the December quarter.
Total operating expenses were $275 million in December and at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 39.1%. For the March quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $278 million at the midpoint, with variability around this level driven principally by the timing of program development costs.
Looking forward, our customers' technology road maps represent an opportunity for served market expansion for process control and market share opportunities for KLA.
Our operating expense investment levels for 2019 are geared to meet the needs of this expanding market for our products and technology. We are making significant investments to support EUV adoption, increasing metrology and inspection challenges in memory and data analytics and design-based capabilities to ensure customers are able to get increasing value from our products. We are optimistic about these growth prospects and plan to invest accordingly.
The effective tax rate was 11.4%. Given the new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, we are adjusting our long-term planning rate down 1% to 14%. At this point, we expect this rate to remain at 14%, inclusive of Orbotech after close of the transaction.
Finally, net income for the quarter was $372 million, and we had 152.6 million fully diluted weighted shares outstanding.
Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.7 billion, cash from operations was $282 million and free cash flow was $256 million. Capital expenditures for 2018 were higher than our historical run rate of around $50 million to $60 million per year due to the expansion of production facilities to support future growth as well as investment to support our new, R&D-focused facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
I would expect CapEx levels to remain elevated in calendar '19 as we continue to make investments in these areas. For calendar year '18, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 30%.
In the December quarter, we baked an aggregate of $115 million in regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $250 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.
We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization with just over $400 million remaining as of the close of the quarter. We expect to complete this program over the next couple of quarters consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional $1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition.
In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA in the December quarter reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control on our customers' growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model.
Given these factors and coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the anticipated Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver long-term value to stockholders.
After three strong years of memory investment, 2019 will be a year of digestion for this segment of the industry. Customers continue to press their technology road maps, but their capacity planning remains fluid.
For KLA, we expect that given our technology leadership, coupled with expected growth in the foundry and logic segments and along with our exposure to broader opportunities in the wafer and reticle markets, we are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2019.
With that, to summarize, guidance for the March quarter is: shipments in the range of $860 million to $940 million; revenue between $880 million and $960 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.67 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.39 to $1.71 per share. We plan to update guidance inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition shortly after completion of the transaction later this quarter.
Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to notify investors that we have decided to shift our 2019 New York Investor Day from the original planned date in March to later in the calendar year. We will update you on the new timing at a later date.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead, sir. So Bren, I'm trying to sort of noodle through the pull-in and noodle through the impact of that. So if I adjust for the pull-in, the shipments were like $2.15 billion in the back half of 2018. And then if I adjust for that pull-in, the shipments would be like $965 million roughly at the midpoint for March.
You said before that the first half shipments would be up versus the back half. So for it to even be flat, that would imply that June shipments would have to be like $1.18 billion or something like that. So they'd have to be up a lot versus March. So I'm just wondering, have those two memory push-outs, do they push out beyond June such that the June shipments would not be $1.18 billion so that it would be what you said it was before? Yes, Tim. So I think on your math, look, we had $65 million of shipment pull-ins into December quarter. So based on that guidance, yes, just that effect alone would move the number from $900 million to $965 million. The push-outs are pretty significant in terms of two major projects.
So I would say one pushed out further than the first half of the year. The other one, we'll see. I think that there are a number of projects where timing might be in the middle of the year. So we'll have to see where it ultimately lands. But clearly, it had a effect on our view.
First half now, I would expect to be down versus the second half of '18. And then we would see a recovery in the second half of '19. So down somewhere in and around 10% plus or minus is how I'm modeling it today, but we'll see how it plays out. Okay. Got it. And then if I look back at the revenue, if I just take the midpoint of the revenue guidance, something like $920 million. And I look back at what you did when you were at $920 million in the past, margin was about 200 basis points higher than what you're guiding it. So can you maybe give a little information why is margin so low? Is it just mix? And do you get that back in June and throughout the rest of the year? So Tim, I mean, we were obviously sizing the company. And as you can see our output from December in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range. So the decline in the second half of the year and then that carrying forward here through the first quarter is that we're taking basically a factory that's sized to ship a much higher level and spreading those costs across a smaller revenue base.
So the volume impact of that is pushing gross margins down, and that's really the only change from a quarter-to-quarter basis as you look at the different moving parts within margin.
So I would expect as we start to see revenue pickup given the guidance we said of sequential revenue growth through the rest of the calendar year, we'll start to see some incremental gross margin improvement there.
And based on the guidance that we were giving in terms of outperform relative to the industry based on where consensus WFE estimates likely are, we probably see gross margins somewhere in and around, I would say, 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points as I'm modeling the year.
We'll have to see how some of the mix dynamics play through. But obviously, we're in a much lower revenue level today. And with the industry contracting than what we saw in calendar '18, and that will have effect on our gross margin in the near term. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir. Hi. This is Ada for John. Can you discuss if you're seeing any changes in domestic China at this point? Well, the domestic China is a little weaker versus the last call where we were thinking that shipments looked about flat for the indigenous projects year-to-year. As we look at that today, it's probably somewhere in the 10% to 15% lower. We'll see. Obviously, visibility in the second half is not so great at this point. But if I look at the shipment profile of what we shipped in '18, what we expect to ship in '19, it's about 10% to 15% lower, most of it around memory. Got it. And can you talk about the implementation of EUV in DRAM and logic foundry and if you're seeing any changes to the adoption cadence given kind of the slow adoption of leading-edge nodes that's being discussed right now? No real change. This is Rick. In terms of the rate of adoption, we see continued piloting in early development with an intent to ramp. And we're participating in that through some of the development work we do and also in the mask shop some of our demand has been driven by that. But no real change in the cadence of what we've seen in the past. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Your line is open. From Cowen, your line is open. Hi. This is Steve calling in behalf of Krish. The first one I wanted to ask about was on your bare wafer inspection tool business. Just given how strong that business has been performing for a while now and just given some of the moderation in wafer starts in the semi industry, how should we think about the trajectory of that business across the rest of this year? Yes. So this is Bren. So that business continues to show very strong momentum. You have to keep in mind that there are a number of things that are happening there. First of all, there was a long period of time without any investment really at all. So there's a change in the capacity requirements there that customers have been investing in.
That, coupled with spec changes, have driven not just the inspection tools, but also need for the metrology tools. So we've seen that business perform very well through '18 and would expect as we look at '19 not much change from that business.
So I would expect to see it carry forward. And based on communications so far with customers, I don't have any reason to change that assessment. Okay. Got it. And as for my follow-up, wanted to ask about the relative trend or profile of foundry and logic demand across this year. Is that going to be more first half weighted followed by a moderation in the back half when, I assume, memory picks up the demand profile or do you also see foundry and logic relatively steady across the year? Thanks. In some of the prepared remarks, we talked about it being reasonably balanced across the halves. So I think second half could be a little bit larger, but generally pretty reasonably balanced for both logic and foundry as you add the two segments together. Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the deferred revenue side, it was a nice uptick for September, but looks like very modest impact here in December. So I guess first question, do you think that the volatility associated with deferred revenues is now behind us? Yes, C.J., I think it is. It wasn't that big of an issue for us. But certainly, we're seeing revenue much closer to shipment as you saw from the results in the December quarter and the guidance for March. And if you look in the 10-Q filing, you see the reconciliation between 605 and 606, effectively the same results quarter-to-quarter.
So there was the timing issues that played out. But at the end of the day, I think the right way to think about the business and model it given that these are really timing dynamics is pretty much the shipment number will be the revenue number with some variation related to new products.
Now we do ship more new products maybe than some of the peers and so that can have an effect or certain regions where you may have to go all the way to customer acceptance. But generally, the numbers are going to be pretty close together. Okay. That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, as you think about the progression of EUV and thinking specifically to foundry, can you speak to what's driving the demand here, 7-nanometer versus 5-nanometer and how you see the revenue kind of progression through calendar '19 and into calendar '20? I'm sorry, C.J., what's driving the demand from the device standpoint or for us? I'm trying to understand your demand side, both from a more modest pilot line 7-nanometer plus activity this year, ramping more aggressively to 5 next year. Yes, sure. It's pretty straightforward actually. Most of the demand early in the 7-nanometer comes out of the mask shop because that's where people are qual-ing new mask sets and driving a lot of utilization of new capability in the mask shop. And also in the development phases of trying to get those devices to work.
And then it'll shift toward production and it will drive more in line kind of applications, both inspection and also some of the metrology needs as we ramp. But right now, what we're experiencing is mainly in the mask shop and the development. Very helpful. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you very much. Maybe, Rick, as a follow-up to C.J.'s EUV question. From your delivery perspective, has everything generally remained on track or do you see any potential pull-ins or push-outs in terms of the timing of delivery of your reticle inspection tools? No, nothing has delayed. If anything, throughout calendar '18, we saw accelerated demand in support of a larger number of starts than we would have forecast for a year ago in terms of advanced design. So far more tapeouts of advanced designs, both for EUV, but also just advanced 7-nanometer without EUV.
So we're seeing the demand on both of those. We don't have an EUV-specific tool in the market. We have tools that can cover both. So we're pretty well situated to support it either way. But that's been strong and particularly in the foundry logic area. Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question in the DRAM market. We've seen how, I think, in the past you've talked about an increase in metrology usage with 3D NAND. As the DRAM industry goes to 1Y and eventually to 1Z and with increases in patterning steps, how do you see the mix of an increase in process control intensity?
Is it going to be more biased towards your inspection tools because of the patterning steps or are you also seeing more metrology applications come online as the DRAM industry migrates down these next few nodes? Yes. Some of both, but for sure, the DRAM will push inspection, high-level inspection sensitivity because they're more sensitive than, say, a NAND flash would be towards advanced inspection capability for smaller defects. So definitely, DRAM is going to push it in terms of things like our Gen 5.
Metrology, both of metrology more so I think the flatness and cleanliness on wafers for NAND has been a driver we've talked about in the past. So it then moves when you got a DRAM back to overlay constraint.
So it really depends. Fortunately, for us, there are different problems that kind of push different parts of the portfolio depending on where they are in the cycle. Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe focusing on products. On your flagship Gen 5 PWI inspection system, can you guys just true us up here? I know the team was anticipating 17 to 18 systems in the field exiting last year. Did you guys hit that target?
And more importantly, sort of given the ramp of EUV, the early work on 5 and 7-nanometer logic, one alpha node for DRAM, what are your thoughts around growth of Gen 5 this calendar year? Yes, Harlan, it's Bren. So thanks for the question. So yes, we did hit our target. Expectations were very consistent or results were consistent with expectations for that product. And as we move into next year, we're still seeing a steady cadence of investment here. Most of the tools are development-focused.
We're introducing the second iteration of the product line that provides more, a better cost of ownership for customers, slightly better throughput and also has some new features with data analytics, computational capability, design-based capabilities and so on.
So it is moving along pretty well, should be deployed. We'll start to see it crossover. I don't know exactly what the crossover percent will look like in '19. But as you start to think about 5-nanometer ramps, you'll start to see more Gen 5 deployed in production. Yes. Okay. Good to see the momentum there. And then can you guys just give us an update on your multicolumn e-beam inspector system for sub 7-nanometer mask inspection? Last time you gave us an update, which was about a year ago, I think the team was on track to introduce systems this calendar year, calendar year '19. Can we get an update and any early metrics on performance, throughput or customer feedback? Customer interest remains high. We are now on a phase of this program where because we're engaged in developments with specific customers, we're not talking publicly about progress.
But I can tell you there's a lot of interest, a lot of demand out there for capability as you've seen the increase in EUV capability and implementation. But we're not in a position right now to go through the specifics of where we're going based on the collaborations we have. Great. Thank you very much. There are no further questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.
As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Thanks, Ed. KLA delivered strong results for the March quarter, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance for revenue and above the range for Non-GAAP EPS. We achieved these results despite the near-term softening in the wafer fab equipment market, showing the resiliency of KLA's business model and the compelling value of our strategy is focused on market and technology leadership, revenue diversification and operational excellence.
We also closed the Orbotech acquisition in Q1, and work has begun to execute integration efforts and realized revenue and cost synergies. The value creation opportunity in the combination with Orbotech are compelling. We are further diversifying our revenue streams and expanding our reach in the global electronics value chain, enhancing our ability to serve new and existing customers in fast growing end markets, such as 5G infrastructure, smart mobile and automotive to name a few.
Now I'd like to point out key reasons why the combination with Orbotech is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Orbotech shares core values with KLA, as well as a proven track record of enabling customer success, having long distinguished themselves for market leadership, innovation, technology and talent. Orbotech's market leader in each of the segments it serves, and there is no customer overlap in the PCB and flat panel markets. And there is no product overlap in the specialty semiconductor and advanced packaging business.
Now, we are serving a larger and more diversified market with a broader portfolio of products and solutions. Orbotech business diversified, serving different segments each with their own cycle dynamics. Orbotech's revenue in calendar 2018 grew 16% to $1.04 billion, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. Of note, the specialty semiconductor business grew 23% in 2018 and is poised for high growth again in 2019, against a backdrop drop of broad-based weakness electronics manufacturing.
Turning now to today's semiconductor market environment. Based on consensus industry reporting, WFE grew in the mid-teens in 2018, which is significantly higher than was previously projected. Process control intensity remain flat in 2018 in a year of strong memory investment. We are seeing higher adoption of inspection and metrology solutions for memory customers to support the 3D NAND roadmap and scaling to tighten design rules and DRAM.
EUV was also a key factor in 2018 equipment spending, including process control infrastructure and reticle and optical wafer inspection. Given the expectation that EUV investment will continue in 2019 and together with a large percentage of foundry and large spending in the WFE Mac mix. We expect process control intensity to increase in the calendar year.
The Gartner report for 2018, shows KLA held strong market share and process control. Thanks to our differentiated product portfolio, technology leadership and strong customer collaboration. Consistent with our peers, we expect WFE will be down approximately 15% to 20%, in 2019, largely due to weaker DRAM demand, NAND investment is also expected to be down in the year.
While foundry and logic investment will increase, driven by the 7-nanometer ramp, EUV development and the steady trailing edge demand to support 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive applications. 2019 will be a dynamic and exciting year for KLA, despite the current market turbulence, we are well positioned to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and our business execution competencies to show good relative performance in the year and emerge even stronger when the market rebounds.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren, for his review of the financial results. Bren? Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a busy quarter for KLA. We launched our new corporate brand in January, closed the Orbotech acquisition in late February, executed a $1.2 billion debt financing in March and delivered results that met or exceeded the updated guidance for the June quarter we issued on March 5 after the close of the acquisition.
Total revenue in the quarter was $1.097 billion at the upper end of the revised guidance range of between $1.025 billion to $1.115 billion. GAAP earnings per share was $1.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.80, finishing above the range of guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.78 at the 14% long-term tax planning.
We are pleased with the results we achieved in Q1 and are off to a solid start for calendar 2019 consistent with our expectations. We are now moving forward in our plans for integration of Orbotech and focusing on strong execution and operations excellence across our business.
Due to the close of the Orbotech acquisition, there are meaningful differences between the GAAP results and the non-GAAP results. I encourage you to review the reconciliation between the two contained in our press release. The remainder of my comments here today are based on the non-GAAP results.
As this is the first quarter we are reporting combined results for KLA and Orbotech, we will provide income statement, cash flow and balance sheet for KLA inclusive of Orbotech in addition to customary disclosures in demand commentary. Bridge results to the original guidance we provided back in January for semi process control business, we will share details on the financial results for this business and Orbotech separately.
We are disclosing this additional information is a means for investors to better understand the dynamics of the KLA and Orbotech businesses in the stub period. Looking ahead, as we move forward in integrating the businesses, we plan to transition our disclosures and financial reporting to reflect the results and operations for KLA on a consolidated basis.
Now, for the March quarter results. As I mentioned, total revenues in the first quarter were $1.097 billion, product sales accounted for 72% of total revenues. We expect total revenue to grow about 14% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion in the June quarter, with sequential quarterly revenue growth expected to continue through the calendar year.
For both the semi process control business and the Orbotech business, we expect the second half revenue levels to be higher than the first half. In terms of regional split of revenue for the combined company, Taiwan was 25% of revenue, China was 19%, Korea was 18%, Japan was 13%, the U.S. was 14%, Europe was 7% and the Rest of Asia was 4%.
Now I'll turn to some detail on commentary regarding demand trends in the March quarter for the semi process control business. Semi process control revenue, which includes the traditional KLA systems and service businesses was $936 million in the quarter.
The expected overall demand environment for 2019, in the semi process control market is consistent with our original view from January with KLA looking to benefit from strong foundry and logic demand growth, reasonably balanced across the year.
And with the expectation for the current soft demand environment in memory to persist throughout the year. Weak memory industry demand continues to influence our customer's caution towards their equipment investment plans. While we have some visibility into plans in this segment, they remain fluid given the current industry outlook and customer commitments could change quickly and without warning.
We remain optimistic about long-term memory equipment demand, due to raising capital intensity to deliver bit growth supply and disciplined financial management by our customers. However, due to the consolidated nature of our industry, any shift in customer delivery requirements could impact our near-term results. Semi process control shipments were $957 million in Q1, above the range of guidance of $860 million to $940 million.
As expected with the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The difference between shipment results and revenue for KLA is immaterial and largely a function of short-term timing dynamics. As a result, we will continue to guide and report shipments through the June quarter, but we'll move to revenue only disclosure for business units, geographic distribution and customer mix, beginning with the reporting of the September quarter.
In short, under ASC 606, the difference between shipments and revenue was not sufficiently material to warrant the cost and effort require to maintain dual reporting. We expect total shipments of $1.235 billion to $1.315 billion in Q2 with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion. Memory was 38% of semi process control system shipments in March and we expect memory to be approximately 47% of this mix in the June quarter.
Foundry was 54% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 41% of the total in June. Shipments to logic customers were 8% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 12% in Q2. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group for the semi process control business was wafer inspection was 42%, patterning was 30%, including shipments for reticle inspection, service was 24% and non-semi component inspection was approximately 4%.
Now for some additional details of results from the Orbotech businesses in the quarter. A reminder that these results are for the 39 days stub period following the February 20th close of the acquisition. Revenue was $161 million above the guided range of $145 million to $155 million for the stub period. The semiconductor device business delivered strong revenues for the first quarter and momentum is expected to continue throughout calendar 2019, driven by strength in PVD and edge applications for RF, power and advanced packaging.
This business is the market technology leader in targeted specialty semiconductor segments and is delivering faster revenue growth rates in the overall semiconductor equipment market and demand drivers include automotive, 5G investment and MEMS/sensor applications for IoT as well as growth in China.
The printed circuit board business grew 10% in 2018 and is positioned to deliver solid relative performance in 2019 compared with the broader electronics market. Orbotech is the market and technology leader in critical applications in the PCB manufacturing process, such as laser direct imaging, optical inspection for defect control and repair. The PCB division will introduce several new products in 2019 to meet the requirements of new technologies such as mSAP and flex PCB and capture the future growth resulting from increasing PCB complexity.
Additionally, the service component is an important aspect of the overall value proposition for this business and is approximately 40% of its total revenue. Similar to the semi-process control service model PCB service has a high percentage of recurring contract revenue and is focused on value-added services such as application support and software upgrades and not just basic break-and-fix services.
The flat panel display business reflects the current weak overall industry demand conditions in LCD and OLED manufacturing. This market is experiencing a digestion period is leading display customers realigned their product strategies and production capacity to shift to new technologies.
Advanced Panel design, such as high-end jumbo OLED TVs and flexible portable displays are becoming more expensive and complex to manufacture, featuring smaller pixel sizes increased pixel density in multiple layers. As the market leader in test repair and inspection solutions for FPD, our business benefits from new capacity growth, as well as from an increasing technical complexity in the next-gen display market. Though the market environment is challenging in 2019, we believe we are well positioned when the market recovers.
Turning now to financial results for the combined company. Gross margin was 60% in March, slightly better than the implied gross margin associated with the updated guidance, as product mix in the semi process control business was mostly consistent with what we modeled in January. In June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%. Gross margin in the semi process control business is expected to be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as modest volume benefit of higher revenue is offset by the expected product mix.
For KLA consolidated gross margin, in addition to expectations for our semi-process control business, the change quarter quarter-to-quarter is also the result of approximately $90 million of additional Orbotech revenue representing a full quarter of revenue for this business.
Based on our current outlook for business unit performance and overall revenue levels for the remainder of calendar 2019, we expect stronger quarterly gross margins in the second half and you should model gross margins for the combined company in the range of 59.5% to 60.5%.
As in past M&A, we see a number of opportunities to improve Orbotech gross margins over time as we leverage our global manufacturing scale shared and common supply chain, service infrastructure, and internal supply capabilities. Total operating expenses were $311 million in March and operating margin was 31.6%.
For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $375 million at the midpoint as we will incur a full quarter of Orbotech operating expenses and a modest increase in R&D expense in our semi-process control business.
Given our topline expectations and planned product development investment profile, we expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019. I would note that OpEx includes stock-based compensation expenses Orbotech, which is previously excluded from there non-GAAP public reporting as an independent company.
Operating expense synergy planning related to the acquisition is underway and we will provide periodic updates on our progress in this area over the coming quarters. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $22 million, including the impact of the debt service to fund a portion of the transaction for the stub period.
Going forward you should model quarterly OIE at approximately $35 million principally due to the incremental debt in the capital structure to fund the acquisition and other corporate activities including our ongoing share repurchase authorization. The effective tax rate was 13% in the quarter, given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, including the contribution from Orbotech, investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at 14% going forward.
Net income was $283 million and we had $157 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, we issued approximately 12 million shares as a component of the transaction consideration for the acquisition. We are expecting weighted average share count for Q2 to be approximately 162 million shares.
Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.9 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. As stated earlier, on March 13th, we issued $1.2 billion of 10 and 30-year senior notes with a blended coupon of 4.4%.
Our gross leverage ratio at the end of the March quarter was 1.7 times within our target range of 1.5x to 2x gross leverage. Cash from operations was $164 million and free cash flow was $138 million. We paid an aggregate of $114 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalent upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $200 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.
We have approximately $1.2 billion available under our current share repurchase authorization. We expect to execute this repurchase program systematically over the next 12, 18 months, subject to market conditions.
In conclusion, the March quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance and relative strength for KLA and a weaker overall WFE environment. We completed the acquisition of Orbotech integration and synergy activities are underway. With a diversified end markets, market leadership across a broad product portfolio and operations discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019. And what is expected to be a challenging year in the electronics manufacturing markets.
With that to summarize, guidance for the June quarter is revenue between $1.21 billion and $1.29 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.90 to $1.39 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.55 per share to $1.85 per share. Total shipments are expected between $1.235 and $1.315 billion with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion in the June quarter.
Before turning the call over for your questions, we're pleased to inform investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We will have more details to follow in the coming weeks and we look forward to seeing you all in September.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, given the limited time for today's call. All right Jerome, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy, your line is now open. Thanks a lot. I had a couple. So Bren, just on the gross margin guidance 58% to 59% non-GAAP, it's a little lower than, if you just sort of do the math for the two companies. It seems like it'd be in the 60% to 61% range. So, first of all, can you sort of talk, is there like a one-timer happening in? And then sort of snap up into the '60s maybe for the back for the back half of the year? Thanks. Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. So, yes, I mean this quarter, there is some just mix dynamics that are driving the margin a little bit lower than you would think. And as I said in the prepared comments that we would expect gross margins in the second half to be higher. At the end of the day on our core business, it's going to move around on product mix across the different products or is bringing revenue in it at about $255 million in the quarter.
We expected to grow in the second half as we said in the comments. And their gross margin is trending in the high 40th percentile. So, when you blend it out that we end up, but I would expect the second half margins to be higher, which is why I gave the full calendar year commentary as well that modeling somewhere between 59.5% and 60.5% for the year. Okay, awesome, Bren. And then maybe, and I know probably you'll go through some of this at the Analyst Day, but can you give us maybe some milepost as the business grows into next year and the year after, sort of what the financial model looks like, and maybe just pick like $6 billion as like an annual run rate once you get to 1.5 billion quarter, what is the model looks like? What's gross margin and what is our margin look like? Thank you. Yes. So Tim, I want to get away from or I want to get into to necessarily guiding out further. And so this is just need just thinking about where the numbers might line up, obviously the comments I made around product mix. Our issues that obviously would affect our performance. But, yes, I think gross margins probably settle in at those kind of revenue levels in the between 60% and 61%.
Certainly, operating expenses are going to move, according to product development requirements. And then, of course, there are some synergy opportunities that we're going to be executing. So the time-frame that we were to get to those kinds of numbers that you referred to would be a factor and all of that.
So, the way we presented in the longer term model was a couple of points of dilution related to the Orbotech transaction to our longer term model that we published, which - so I think that, when you're thinking in the mid-30 kind of percent operating margin range on those revenue levels. So, hopefully that helps. Okay, Bren, thank you so much. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek, your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the overall demand environment. I think when the year started the industry view was that WFE would be down 10% to 15% - it's down 15% to 20%, not just from you guys, but obviously from all of your peers. What's the slope of recovery here? When do you think the start to get visibility as to when we will see a recovery in overall spending? Yes, this is - I'll take part of it, and then this is Rick and Bren can add in. It is true that the rate of decline, the magnitude is higher, but that's largely because December finished stronger - 28 finish stronger than - 2018 than we had originally modeled. And so if you look at what the overall numbers we're talking about for 2019.
We're still in a similar kind of range $45 billion to $46 billion with WLP. So that was really the way we're looking at that. And we'd also said in the past that this is really starting to strengthen even into the June quarter, but the second half as Bren indicated in his comments are going to be stronger for KLA, but also for the industry. Yes, the only - to Rick's points, the year-over-year ratios are moving around given the strength of the finished 2018 now that everybody has reported. And so it looks like 2018 is a little bit stronger. So our view is very consistent with what we thought in January. We saw mid-40s WFE levels for the year with the March quarter being the bottom and sequential growth for the Company resuming in June and continue in the second half. So second half stronger than first half.
Foundry logic reasonably balanced across the year was our perspective. So, what's interesting is we are three months later and his played out as we thought. So, I don't think there's anything really different than what we thought a couple of months ago. And certainly, we are watching the end market dynamics and what those ultimately will mean to just given the consolidated nature of our business to our customers' investment plans. But so far, playing out as we expected a few months ago. Thanks. And for my follow-up, China, so the demand from China, do you think that is kind of trending down in line with the overall WFE? Or are you seeing any more disruption because of trade tension or is this just an absorption period of because what they installed last year. So what I'm getting with that is that as we hopefully get some easing of tensions, do you think demand from China will improve at some point? Yes, we've had puts and takes around China. We disclosed shipment profile in January that we thought to be down between 10% and 15% in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018. And our view is pretty consistent with that. We've seen some strengthening from certain customers and we came from others.
So our general view is pretty consistent overall, so it looks like we'll see more foundry logic investment this year. And certainly, you have the OEMs that are investing both in terms of - or the need for wafer capacity materials, wafer capacity and reticle capacity.
So I would say for 2019, our views are pretty consistent thousands what we thought a few months ago. I would say that on the trade tensions, I'd say that was a factor early in the calendar year at the end of last year of uncertainty.
And now I think the way China is behaving as more just based on the way the overall industry is behaving relative to demand, and so we're seeing those plans are gated on that, not as much on concerns around trade. Thanks. Very helpful. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan, your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On Orbotech, there's been some headwinds on the display, CapEx trends this year as you guys mentioned, but the move to OLED by some of their customers should boost capital intensity for their products.
In PCB disappointing handset unit trends, but again offset by the move to things like mSAP technology and more automotive goodness there, SDD continued strong, so a number of puts and takes, but this is on the June quarter guidance and sort of backing into the full quarter March revenues for Orbotech in your comments about second half. It does appear that Orbotech will drive higher revenues versus calendar year 2018. Is that a fair assumption? So Harlan, when we look at the business today, and again, we only had it for the 40 days of the first quarter. So we do expect sequential growth through the year. I would say, or Orbotech that will be in the ballpark of what they did in calendar 2018 based on what we see today, perhaps slightly less.
I think given our relative to prepare - given the environment overall for electronics in terms of just softening and digestion that's happening out there. Looks like the business has been pretty resilient for the reasons that you described. And certainly what we're seeing on the semiconductor side is that's an area of WFE where there is growth in investment. And so, we would expect to see that business grow more in a more meaningful way in 2019 versus 2018. And then longer-term, Harlan, we're - we believe we're on track with the architect plan that was laid out in 2017, when you talk about the longer-term trends all seem to be very positive and we're excited about what we've seen. We think the Company is well positioned with the assets as part of KLA and we'll continue to build on the momentum, as you say FPD has had some headwinds, but there's been some good wins in the other parts of the business. Yes, absolutely. Good insights sir. Thank you. And then looking at the Gartner shared data for 2018 in your flagship optical inspection franchise. Think you guys gained about 500 basis points of market share, and I think now you guys are almost like 14x larger than your nearest competitor, and this is versus a 7x last year. So, huge drop of your competitors. Is the bar just getting raised really that much higher with like your Gen 5 tools and your updated Gen 4 platform. And then how is the momentum shaping up this year for your Gen 5 platform? So I'll take part and then let Bren get into the specifics. I think you're right. I think that what we're seeing is to continued investment by our customers and the flagship products both Gen 4 and Gen 4. And so one of the things I think a couple of generations we realized is we're going to keep investing in prior generation. So for example, the Gen 4 is how to build out two, in addition to what we're seeing at Gen 5.
And I think for our customers it's the most effective way to manage their yield challenges and wrap their facilities. So we feel really good about where we are. We continue to invest strongly and as Bren will tell you, we're seeing the progress that we were hoping for in Gen 5. Yes, this year's a good year for Gen 5 Harlan we expected to see multiple units adoption from all major customers, so encouraged by that. We'll probably end the year with somewhere around 30 units in the field. If I were to fast forward, obviously we need to execute over the next several months. But that's our expectation. So it's nice growth and adoption of that product line. And we introduced the next iteration on Gen 4 product is customers tried to extend that capability too.
So you're seeing a mix and match adoption profile from our customers there. We also have a new product in the laser scanning space called Voyager. And that's the adoption has been really positive on that too. So you're seeing to mix and match across the Puma platform, plus Voyager. So for the total portfolio of optical pattern inspection, it's very well positioned in the market and we would expect as you see foundry move on to 5 nanometer down the road, including what they're doing today to support 7 nanometers activities, the logic investments that are happening. We feel pretty good about the position into that product line. Yes. Nice job on the execution. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open. Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. As always appreciate sort of the industry backdrop color you gave in your preamble. I'd be coming curious, especially with the inclusion of Orbotech, you gave us a lot of color around what happens to the total addressable market in calendar year 2019. I'll be curious as to how you see your SAM evolving in calendar year 2019 with all the puts and take? Sure. I think that as we laid out early, Orbotech we think gives us access to another $2.5 billion in overall addressable market based on their position. We think that as we go forward to combine that with what we have in the rest of our business, we're at about $8 billion this year, and that should continue to grow.
Basically, as we think about the products that are in the pipeline and things that we're working on, we think the TAM over the next few years grows, maybe another 10% beyond that $8 billion as we go forward based on new product entries and market growth. So we don't need a tremendous amount of market growth based on some of the new work that's going on and pipeline, both for KLA what was our process control business and now as we talk about our process business, which is in semiconductor and also FPD and PCB. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren. Just going back to the gross margin, you said in the June quarter guide there sort of a one-time mix issue. Is that just more Orbotech revenue or just going on in the mix with the core KLA business. Then as we think about the full-year gross margin, is it pretty much a linear progression September, December to get to that number Or how are we thinking about exit trajectory of gross margin and what's driving the improvement? Is this overall mix of business? Or is it you actually getting your hands on the Orbotech asset and driving some cost synergies? Yes, John, thanks for the question. So, consistent with the commentary around revenue growth, we expect gross margin to improve quarter-on-quarter as we progress through the year. So on the core KLA business we saw little bit more revenue in the June quarter.
We'll see versus March and the mix of the business, particularly around reticle inspection where we've had some higher mixed mashup business and that's being offset by some fab business, which we're very happy with the penetration in performance there, but the margin profile is different. So we do see pretty wide swings around those products depending on what segment you're shipping into.
So I do think that it's all kind of coming together into a lower profile in the June quarter, and we would expect to see it improve through the second half. I would say the same thing about the Orbotech business given the rapid growth there. And certainly, over time as we execute on synergies and we're doing a lot of planning today, but we would expect to see that sort of start to flow through the model certainly around supply chain, internal supply and other things.
It will take a little bit of time for that to happen. So I think the trajectory moves that way. June is a little bit weaker with the tools that we ship or the tools that we shipped and how that profile plays out is how it influences the mix. But overtime, structurally, we feel pretty good about where the margin profile is overall on the KLA business and there's opportunities on the Orbotech side over time. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is now open. Great, thank you. Thank you taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins, just wanted to clarify the 59.5% to 60.5% commentary. Was that for all of calendar 2019 or is that expected range for the back half 2019? And as part of that, could you walk through I guess the margin contributions across the three sub-segments within Orbotech, and if you can't be terribly precise perhaps rank order highest to lowest that would be very helpful? Thanks. Sure, CJ. So the guidance for the calendar year, obviously includes March and June, and then what we expect in the second half. So when you're thinking about the calendar year profile that's in the margin profile be to achieve that you need to see the margins improve in the second half.
And I would say in the upper end of the range that I provided for the full calendar year. So hopefully that helps from a modeling perspective. On the Orbotech business, I think on the specialty semi side, the easiest way to think about the three businesses, is especially the semi side tends to be in the mid-50s plus or minus, you're probably in the high-40s on PCB and you're probably in the mid to high-30s generally on FPD.
Now FPD piece has a lot to do with the business levels, given the leverage that in that model given the higher level cyclicality for that business. That's the smallest part of Orbotech, as you to think about the three businesses. So certainly over time, given the expectations of growth around the specialty side, we would expect to see the mix improve in terms of the gross margin profile. That's very helpful. And as my follow up I guess at a higher level, can you talk through how you're partnering with Amichai and the rest of the Orbotech team to drive top line synergies and I think you guys so clearly see in both the specialty semi and PCB side, what kind of groups perhaps you've created and what the timeline is to start to see those revenue synergies hit the model? Thank you. Sure. This is Rick. There are two things going at once. Orbotech was a successful company standalone for a number of years and has been successful in growing their business. So on the one hand, we've been very mindful of that as we began integration to let them to continue to work together as not quite separate, but continue to drive their business independently.
However, over the last couple of months, we've seen customers actually ask us for to work together and we've seen some opportunities to do that. So that's really a slow roll out. We're going to detail this in quite a bit when we come in September for our Analyst Day, and we're going to talk more about it, but it is very encouraging especially in the specialty semiconductor where we do have customer overlap, no product overlap, the customer overlap looking for more capability.
And I also think there are some customers that specialty semiconductor division was working on and the addition of KLA to the portfolio for them makes it more likely that we'll gain share and also market share there. So we think there's great opportunity. And the other business is maybe a little bit more of some cost synergies as we work through some of the operational opportunities we have there and then their supply chain, which kind of covers those two businesses also where will continue to drive that. But again, that's something we're going to lay out in more detail as we do our Analyst Day in September. The other thing I'll add on that one is that, as you think about the PCB business and advanced printed circuit board technology is you are starting to see more blending between advanced packaging in PCB on the roadmap for our customers as they try to drive cost in capability improvements.
And so, certainly, we have some exposure to that space, Orbotech does as well. So we're investigating what - how that strategy might play out and certainly how technology might be applicable as we start to think about the growth exists there. So early days on a lot of this work, but certainly something we'll outline in more detail when we get to the meeting in September. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Krish, your line is now open. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Bren, I don't know if I missed it, if you strip out the Orbotech revenues in March and June, is the core legacy KLA business growing? So is it like low-to-mid single, just want to get color on that, and I had a follow-up? Yes, so in the prepared remarks, so against the guidance we gave in January, we guided for a midpoint on revenue of $920 million. We came in at $936 million. And then for the June quarter, we talked about shipments of approximately $1 billion. And also some comments around with 606, this transition to successfully expand that there isn't much difference between shipments and revenues.
So hopefully that gives you the color. And again, it's consistent with what we thought in terms of March being a bottom and expecting to see growth in the June quarter and sequentially for the remainder of the calendar year. So, if you think about the broader performance of the business given the mix of WFE, yes, most of the decline is driven by DRAM, into a lesser extent, the decline in NAND.
But you also have significant growth in foundry and logic. We're also seeing investments that are happening and reticle and in wafer. So, when you add all that together, our expectations is you see process control intensity improved in the year, but also that our relative performance relative to the industry should be better. So I think it's playing out the way we thought. And we're pleased with our market position and how we're seeing in the segments play out. Got it. That's very helpful. Bren, and then a question for Rick. It looks like you guys are getting some traction in the EUV inspection side. EUV in theory is going to replace some of the multi-patterning steps. So if you look at it on the inspection side, is it fair to assume that EUV inspection will replace some of the regular inspections and net-net it's a neutral impact for you guys? Do you think there's actually growth did you inspection? Process control intensity goes up with EUV. That's clear. And it does so because of the additional requirements associated with the reticle inspection is going to just the stakes are higher with those reticles. And I also think you're going to see more focus on print call. So you're going to have more optical inspection as well.
Not to mention some of the challenges, we're going to have with overlay when they get to multi-pattern. And so I think there is good reason to believe that we'll see intensity go up over time. Now, when you think about how much of the market is really EUV at this time, it's a pretty small number. So that percentage is going to take some time to accumulate but it's definitely increase intensity. Thanks, Rick. Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. You're line is now open. Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on the memory side of the business. Sounds like DRAM is weak as well 3D NAND in your June comments, I think you said memory increases to 47% of shipments from 38% of shipments. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color, what's going on there? And then my follow-up question is on the bare wafer inspection segment. It looks like Gartner's reporting that segment increased something like 87% in 2018. How do you see that part of the business in 2019? Thank you. Yes, on the shipment profile, the shipments to memory customers are higher in the June quarter. There's a couple of big projects that we expect to ship to both in the DRAM and the flash side. So I think in terms of the second half of the year, we'll see how that plays out and we'd expect increasing momentum as we move through the year, but we do have higher shipment levels to both segments of memory in the quarter related principally to two or three projects.
On the bare wafer side, we've seen a lot of growth in that business. I mean, 2018 was a great year and 2019 was flat to 2018. And it's not just the bare wafer customers as much as it's also on pattern inspection and metrology overall, which has been driven by the high levels of memory investment. So, you have capacity requirements, but you also had changing specifications for metrology and the cleanliness requirements for 3D NAND is driving a lot of investment in that product. So we would expect similar results in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018 in that business against the backdrop of the declines in the WFE market.
Now as we move to 2020, I would expect some of that capacity on the wafer side too - those that demand on the wafer side to pull back a bid calendar 2020 still much higher sustaining level given the requirements I talked about. But we would expect for this year and to be very consistent with what we saw last year. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line as to shear off Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya, your line is now open. Yes, great. Thanks for taking the question. You guys provided long-term growth expectations for Orbotech when you guys announced the deal. I think it was 15% for semiconductor devices, 13% for display and 8% for PCB. Have those numbers changed at all given the developments over the past 12 months? Yes. So we put those numbers are very consistent with the year 2020 model that tech had presented probably back in 2017. So look the assumptions move around, certainly these lay assumptions move around, I would say I'm probably more optimistic on the semiconductor side and a little less. So on the display side. But overall, the expectations for that business, which 2020 model I believe was $1.25 billion.
I feel pretty good about that at least today based on the path that we see to get there. Obviously, the size of these markets and how the electronics market and markets play out will influence that. But we haven't seen anything at a top level that, that we think this way this from that view that, they should be able to achieve the 2020 plan that we laid out when we announce the transaction. Okay, great. And Bren as a quick follow-up on synergies is $50 million over the next six quarters still the right way to think about synergies from Orbotech? And I guess related to that, what sort of OpEx synergies are embedded in your June and back half guidance of $370 million to $375 million? Thank you. Yes, very little is embedded. We targeted a time frame of 12 to 24 months. We're doing that work now, I think just given the timing of how those actions could play out and how you see it flow out of the model, it'd probably be - we start to see some benefit towards the very tail end of the year. So limited synergies are forecasted in the guidance again, both for OpEx and for top line. So - but our goal is $50 million, by the $50 million run rate by the end of 12 to 24 months from the transaction and we feel pretty comfortable with the ability to get there. We'll see how it plays out, I would say, it's probably more $20 million to $25 million in OpEx and maybe $25 million to $30 million in the COGS volumes. Great. Thanks for the color. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Deutsche Bank. Patrick, your line is now open. Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in your comments regarding China, you said the industry spending to be down, however, with the memory market in China going through some significant yield issues. Could you see KLA outperforming, I guess that outlook based on increasing process control intensity to help them along their development curve? Yes, both things are true. We do see overall market coming down as we said memory down, China maybe a little less. And we're continue to be strong as we help them in terms of some of their aspirations about driving these new processes. So yes, we do see intensity higher there we should outgrow in China. Great. Maybe as my follow-up question on the EUV inspection side of things, you've talked about the limited availability to date, primarily on the foundry logic side of things, how do you see the memory market, particularly DRAM in terms of its adoption and how it could influence your EUV inspection bias? There is some adoption there. I would say it's from our perspective, we're going to be engaged if that happens. I think like everyone, they're going to look at the cost benefit of doing that versus the alternatives probably most pronounced via formation. So I think that we're going to see the opportunities there as they come. But I would say it's much more limited in memory then relative to logic or foundry. Great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is now open. Thank you for taking my questions. Rick, since you start to move to 7-nanometer, 6, 5, 5.5 just seems like there are just a smaller and smaller increments in terms of the shrinkage. Can you just talk about within there like $10 billion to $11 billion kind of CapEx outlook are you expecting your sales to grow as a leading foundries move in smaller steps? We do. Before I want to correct something I just said, it's the storage note on DRAM, that's something that, not the VF formation. In terms of increasing intensity for the foundries, absolutely, I think the challenge for the foundries is yield at these advanced nodes. And as you know, as you push these the stress on EUV increases in terms of - or the economic viability.
So we're going to see process control intensity throughout really the supply chain, whether it's in - you have to make the reticles and that's a challenging prospect now and maybe the most challenging. So between reticle formation and the print down onto the wafer to make sure you have clean images. I think that's a challenge to make sure that the defectivity is low.
So we're seeing demand in the design sign to form these - the early tape-outs, and then we'll see it in production. So as the note scale, I think they're going to be largely driven on the economics of those nodes as it drives our customers. Okay. And then when we would at SPIE conference earlier this year, there was a discussion on stochastic defects. But the message here was that the chipmakers need help from every type of inspection equipment, whether it's e-beam or optical, just because these issues is far greater than anyone expected. Is your view on e-beam that it's still will be available as a combination to optical as part of your strategy. Is that still your strategy or you've had a changed strategy? No real change. I mean, we've talked about leveraging e-beam platform to do some of the inspections on the reticle itself and that's a reticle without a pellicle just to validate the design. But when you do - when you print down and you're trying to model and manage the stochastic implications, you really need optical for that, because you need to have enough throughput to be able to cover enough area. So it's certainly going to be a blended approach by our customers and we are committed to having all the capabilities that they need Thanks At this time, there are no further questions on queue.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.
Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.
As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. Q4 was another solid quarter for KLA with results finishing above the midpoint of guidance demonstrating the company is benefiting from our strategies for growth in market leadership while delivering strong relative performance in a challenging year for the industry.
I'd like to provide some insights into today's equipment demand environment. Even with the signs of stabilization and NAND pricing, DRAM continues to be weak and the business environment in memory is soft. This has resulted in broad based low levels of investment as customers have idled existing capacity and delayed new capacity plans as they focus on rebalancing supply and demand. The weakness in memory is being offset by rising demand from foundry and logic, which are traditionally strong markets for KLA.
The business environment in foundry and logic is expected to continue to be strong through the second half of 2019 and into 2020, driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at the leading-edge, increasing competitive dynamics, and investment in EUV infrastructure. Altogether our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 remains consistent with the initial view we held in January, with demand expected to decline by approximately 20% in the year and with a significant shift in product mix to foundry and logic.
Now I'd like to update you on some recent product highlights from our semiconductor process control business. KLA's market leadership is enabled by successful execution of a portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're very pleased with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we're experiencing across our portfolio.
For example, we are currently seeing accelerated adoption of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, which is now in its second iteration since first being produced in 2016. We expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 compared to the previous year. Customers are leveraging the combination of sensitivity and throughput in this platform to enable unique detection of yield limiting defects at significantly lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives.
The strong customer adoption of Gen 5 and the continued success of the Gen 4 platform, now in its fifth iteration, are further confirmation of the success of our multi-generation platform strategy for innovation and market leadership in optical inspection. Further, the latest generation of our laser scattering optical inspection platform, known as Voyager, is also enjoying strong adoption in the marketplace. Leading memory and foundry customers are deploying Voyager for in-line monitoring application in high-volume manufacturing.
In mask inspection, the strong momentum which we have experienced over the past several quarters continues and is positioned to extend through 2020. We are seeing upside from leading foundries for our latest generation mask inspection platform and expect demand to broaden as customers move ahead with our EUV deployment strategies.
In metrology as WFE is transitioning more toward logic and foundry, we're seeing strong adoption of the new film and CD platforms released last year as our customers ramp complex technology architectures like finFET, new materials and new metal interconnects. And with the recent acquisition of Orbotech, we are further diversifying our business, broadening our product portfolio and growth opportunities and serving a larger market.
Integration and synergy activities are now well underway and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in combination with Orbotech. We look forward to further discussions on this in our upcoming Investor Day in September.
In summary, despite uncertainty in the current industry demand environment, momentum is building for KLA driven by strength in our semiconductor process control business and contributions from the recent acquisition of Orbotech. As a result, we are on a path for strong relative performance in 2019 while we continue to drive innovation and introduce differentiated products and solutions to serve the market when growth re-accelerates.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the Q2 financial results. Bren? Thanks Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue in Q2 was 1.258 billion and above the midpoint of range of guidance. GAAP earnings per share was $1.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78 each finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Total shipments were $1.354 billion approximately $79 million over the midpoint and exceeding the high end of the range or guidance for the quarter. Semiconductor process control shipments were approximately $1.080 billion.
We are pleased with the results we achieved in the June quarter despite significant noise and uncertainty in the global electronics market. As we continue to focus on executing our business across all markets, and move forward with our integration and synergy plans from the Orbotech acquisition.
Beginning this quarter, we will report our results under the new segment reporting structure that we adopted subsequent to the completion of the Orbotech acquisition and you will see this reflected in our Form 10-K when it is filed. Under this new structure we will report the KLA process control business in the semiconductor process control segment and will separate the former Orbotech businesses into two segments; specialty semiconductor process and PCB display and component inspection. The latter segment now includes the former ICOS component inspection business of KLA.
We believe this new segment reporting structure best reflects how our business is organized and the unique characteristics of each segment in terms of channels, markets, and technology. Results from the applicable services components will also be included within each segment. In addition, the June quarter will the last quarter we report shipments in our earnings call and we will no longer provide shipment guidance going forward.
As explained in detail on the earnings call last May, under ASC 606 revenue recognition, the overall timing of revenue shifts forward and as a result, the difference between shipments and revenue is immaterial and does not warrant the resource commitment to maintain dual reporting. Subsequently, investors can assume a close approximation of shipments to reported revenue in any given quarter.
Now, for the June quarter results, as I mentioned total revenue in the fourth quarter [ph] were $1.258 billion. We expect total revenue to grow about 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion in the September quarter. And for the second half revenue level to be higher than the first half with continued sequential growth expected in the December quarter across all our business segments.
I'll now turn to some detail and commentary regarding segment revenue trends in the June quarter. For the semiconductor process control segment, which as stated represents all legacy KLA, except our component inspection business, revenue was $1.003 billion in the quarter. component inspection revenue was just over [indiscernible]. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 remains mostly consistent with our original view from January with KLA benefiting from stronger foundry and logic demand.
I will note that on the margin over the past six months, although review of the overall demand environment in 2019 is unchanged, the near-term outlook for foundry and logic investment has improved offset by declines in memory. In fact, over the course of the June quarter we've seen our overall second half expectations improve modestly. Our current view for the semiconductor process control businesses is for the second half revenue to be up in the low double-digits versus first half of the calendar year as we now expect revenue from foundry and logic customers to be up over 35% versus the first half.
Memory investment remains weak and directed towards technology migration only. Memory was approximately 51% as semiconductor process control systems shipments in June and we expect memory to be approximately 42% of system revenue in the September quarter. Foundry was 35% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 44% of system revenue in Q3 [ph]. Shipments from logic customers were 14% and the current outlook is for logic revenue to be approximately flat in September.
Turning now to discussion of the semiconductor process segment, the former SPTS division at Orbotech. SPTS is a leader in PVD and etch solutions in fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices, as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $67 million.
June quarter results for this business were impacted meaningfully by the U.S. Department of Commerce ban on shipments of RF and MEMS semiconductors to Huawei as customers with Huawei market share delayed planned capacity investments. As the leader in etch and deposition tools for these markets, SPTS saw a delay in a portion of its expected business due to this ban. Though the longer term implications of this action are not clear, notwithstanding this issue, SPTS is still expected to deliver year-over-year pro forma revenue growth in calendar year 2019.
Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $185 million. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's ICOS component inspection business. Results for this segment were in line with our expectations for the quarter and are on track with our plans for this year.
Now I'll discuss the distribution of revenue by major product category in Q2. Wafer inspection was 32%. Patterning and which includes reticle inspection was 23%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the semiconductor process control segment. PCB display and component inspection revenue was 10% and specialty semiconductor processes 4%. Other, which includes solar, instruments, and the KLA pro mature products enhancements business was 4%. Service was 27% of revenue in the June quarter.
In terms of regional split of revenue, China was 32%, Taiwan was 25%, the U.S. was 15%, Japan was 10%, Korea was 8%, Europe was 6% and rest of Asia was 4%.
Now for more detail on the results and the P&L. Gross margin was 58.9% in June at the top end of the guided range for the quarter of 58% to 59% as a higher level of semi process control revenue offset the Huawei effect on our specialty semiconductor business. We expect gross margin in the September quarter to be in the range of 60% to 61% as the more favorable product mix in our semi process control business and higher expected service margins drive gross margin improvement in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we believe there are many opportunities for us to improve the Orbotech gross margin profile across the businesses by leveraging our global supply chain, service infrastructure and global footprint. We will discuss these initiatives in more detail over the coming quarters as we get a firm picture on the timing and financial impact of these actions.
Total operating expenses were $370 million in June below the guided $375 million target due to lower than expected expenses across the business and some synergy benefit from Orbotech. Operating margin was 29.5%. We expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019 consistent with the timing of our planned product development investments and the realization of initial synergy activities. Other income and expense in the June quarter was $38 million and we expect OIE [ph] to be approximately $36 million this quarter.
The effective tax rate was 13.7% and going forward investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at the 40% level given a new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit. Net income was $289 million and we had 162 diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Now for some highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.7 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. Cash from operations were $325 million and free cash flow was $270 million. We are making infrastructure investments to support our future growth, including the construction of a new building in our Milpitas Headquarter site, and a new facility in Ann Arbor Michigan. We expect annual capital expenditures to exceed [indiscernible] over the next few years due to these projects and other infrastructure investments necessary to sustain our future growth expectations.
In the June quarter we've made an aggregate of $121 million in regular quarterly dividend and dividend equivalents upon vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $345 million of common stock at an average share price of just below $112 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $900 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. For September we expect fully diluted share count of between 159 million and 160 million shares.
In conclusion, the June quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance with our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across our broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019 and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in our business.
With that, to summarize, guidance for the third quarter [ph] is revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.39 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 a share to $2.34 per share.
Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to remind investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We look forward to seeing you there.
I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please feel free to requeue if you have any additional questions, which we will accommodate as time permits. Jerome, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You are now live. Yes, good afternoon guys. I appreciate letting me ask questions, congratulation on the solid results. Rick, it's good to see foundry and logic performing strongly in the calendar second half's expectation that continues into 2020, I'd be kind of curious, as you look at the memory market and differentiate between NAND, DRAM and maybe process control and bare wafer, how do you think that market plays out in the back half of year, which quarter do you think it bottoms in and how do you think about the recovery potential in 2020? I'll give you some thoughts and then let Bren weigh in. Right now we don’t see, as we said, we don’t see a lot of momentum in DRAM. I think what we've got now is some strengthening I think we think in the foundry and logic as we said, but not a lot other than technology migration and not a lot of capacity. So if you think about when the recovery might come for NAND probably first half of 2020 and DRAM what our customers are saying now is more mid 2020 timeframe before we would see any meaningful change. Yes, John, I would say that I'd characterize the market as what we're most is seeing the technology migration investment only and one thing about KLA is since we do help our customers navigate their roadmap transitions we are seeing some level of business from some of these customers. There is also some activity in China. We saw some last quarter shift influenced our shipments and we expect to see some more in the second half of the year.
But to Rick's point, I think as we look at the overall market I wouldn’t expect to see any meaningful capacity as until we get into 2020. And given that customers have been disciplined and pushing out capacity they have been idling capacity. How quickly that comes back is a little early to tell from this point.
You mentioned bare wafer, on the bare wafer side we see our business at bare wafer being roughly flat into the second half of 2019. Now 2019 overall for that business is lower than it was in 2018. We had a huge inflection in 2018. We've seen it come off a bit in 2019, it probably comes off a little bit in 2020.
I think we're operating that at a more sustainable or higher level for that business moving forward given the dynamics around memory, around specifications both for inspection, but also from metrology. So, and the numbers that we provided in the commentary I think that's been part of our view in terms of expectations moving forward. So I wouldn’t say that much has changed there and that's certainly we've been pretty open about. Well that all, I got it. And maybe as my followup, Rick I'd love to get your comments on just inspection and process control intensity in foundry and logic as you move to 7 and then 5 and I guess it's kind of a complex equation. How does EUV going to fit you guys in the business going forward? Sure, John. I think a couple of things, one we mentioned the strength in Gen 5 and a lot of that is driven, of course logic is going to drive that harder than we're seeing that transition from Gen 4 to Gen 5 in terms of the bulk of our system. So the design will shrink. We're going to drive smaller deep activity requirements driving toward the Gen 5.
The other thing that's happening is overlay is a big driver for us in terms of the additional pressure put on our customers as they drive advanced design rolls. Eventually we're seeing that in a couple of ways. One, we're seeing it in our shop with the number of starts, pre-EUV but also the anticipated large number of EUV, but also the print down checks, because I think what's really going to happen for a while as people are going to want to verify the designs, so another use for Gen 5.
So overall, we think there is going to be an increase in process control intensity as we introduce EUV I think that that's more in the development phase. Longer term I think it levels out a bit as we get into high volume production later. But right now definitely the mix is favorable to us in terms of what we're seeing. We also mentioned increased competition in foundry and that's also been a driver I think to the mixed shift overall. Thanks and congratulations. Thanks John. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. You are now live. Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarterly execution and strong outlook. In terms of the strong results and outlook, specifically within your mask or reticle inspection business, EUV system shipments, looks like they are going to grow about 70% this year.
If I look into next year, the installed EUV base is still growing about 50% to 60%. So given your guide is very high market share at the of mash ups how do you see your mash up inspection business directionally and do you guys already have visibility into the directionality of this segment next year just given the long lead times and continued growth of the installed base? Yes Harlan, it's Bren and I'll go first here, but if you look at the reticle inspection business couple of things are driving it. First, significant tape-out in the foundry at 7 nanometer and so that's driving significant purchasing of the product. You have to remember that reticle inspection in a mash up behaved somewhat to process, when you are inspecting every reticle before you ship it to the fab. So it has some unique dynamics in terms of how customers buy relative to the design starts and they move together. That's one dynamic and that's driving the business.
The other obviously is the EUV development activity that's also driving the Teron system. So you have both effects, but frankly the biggest driver today is more around the design start at 7 and it is driving that business to have nice solid growth in the year obviously where WFE is down. So we're seeing growth in that and as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we would expect that to continue into 2020.
Timing of the EUV deployment and how we see that plays out next year, it will potential influence some of the upgrades to the existing install base out there, but there is some sustainability in the business and we're seeing a nice recovery in it. And then we'll see that next generation products as they come out as we move into the second half of next year to support EUV directly. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in that space and we're seeing the numbers flow through in terms of P&L impact. I think just to build on one aspect of it, I think the fact that we have extended the Teron platform to be able to handle these EUV layers, yes we benefit whether or not depending on the number of EUV layers, we still benefit because we've got an optical platform that can handle either the mask for EUV or for traditional lithography. So I think that's a part of why we're benefiting more depending on the starts and just the intensity of the advanced nodes, not necessarily just on the EUV because it's still not clear how many layers and at what nodes they are going to be adopted, but we're seeing strength in reticle regardless of which way that goes. All right, thanks for the insights there. And then you guys were thinking 90 days ago that there was an upward bias for the Orbotech business moving into the second half of the year, but just given all of the China trade overhang, given that Orbotech has a number of large customers, do you guys still see the second half of this will be better for the Orbotech team and if so, maybe a bit of color on what segments are improving in the second half? I mean I would assume that specialty semi is doing well just given the strong focus on RF and power, but what about FPV and PCB? Yes, so growth expectations for specialty semi have come down a bit for this year directly related to the Huawei effect. The indirect effect, but you do have customers in the RF space that have market share with Huawei phones and so they've more cautious and in some of their plans for capacity and that's impacted that business.
So that business is still going to grow year-over-year, but probably not to the degree that that we expected 90 days ago before the ban came out. I would say PCB and flat panel, are in line with our expectations, PCB flattish, flat panels down this year, but most of the growth for the business is going to come from specialty semi. So there's still some growth there year-to-year, but but a little bit less given the Huawei effect. Yes. But just to put it in perspective Harlan, we're still within a few percentage of what we had originally modeled in terms of profitability and contribution to KLA for the business. So it still looks good. As Bren said, some kind of shifting dynamics, so not really that different from what we thought earlier in the year. Yes, great job on the execution. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You are now live. Thanks a lot. I guess the first question Rick is that, there have been some other companies in your broader sector that the past couple of weeks have talked about, some pull-ins from China that are sort of helping the back half of the year. And I know you talked last quarter about a big project that was out of the second half and now is sort of back in the second half, but what are you seeing generally in China? I guess, is it your view that the trade stuff only increases the pace of these projects as you kind of look into the back half of the year and into next year? We have definitely seen some puts and takes in China to the point, but we're seeing what others are seeing, where so maybe increased urgency in terms of the second half to get those projects fully up and as you know, there's just a lot of noise in the system. In terms of what effects might come in. The only substantial thing we've seen is a very small part of our business as Bren mentioned, but overall, pretty much where we thought in terms of the second half having some strength in it. Yes, I think the DRAM project, I mean it's interesting at that start beginning of the year, we thought it was completely out and wow it looks like we'll see it ship in the second half of the year. We're seeing to Rick's point some puts and takes related to some of the wafer plants in China. So overall I would say our expectations for China business this year versus where we thought are probably on the margin, slightly higher than where we were before, but not a lot of change there overall. Okay Bren, thanks. And then I guess is the second question, I'm wondering if you can quantify in the spec SMEs segment how much the sort of indirect Huawei there, is it something like $10 million to $20 million a quarter, is that what it's costing you sort of into the back half of the year? I'm just sort of trying to baseline what the business would look like if this ban had not, or is not in effect? Yes, so Tim, I think in the immediate quarter and you'll see some adjustments to plan meet the quarter, the impact was between $20 million and 25 million and certainly some of the strength in other parts of our business helped us achieve our results for the quarter. That number probably goes up to the $35 million-ish plus or minus as we move into the second half of the year in terms of our expectations. In total, so probably somewhere around $35 million to $40 million impact on calendar 2019.
In the long run, it's interesting as those, as other providers that are non-U.S. providers start to ramp their capacity that creates an opportunity for the specialty semiconductor business there. So in the long run, and they are in an inferior position, so in the long run there potentially a big opportunity out there in terms of how the designing around the supply chain works. But in terms of the current year, the impact is probably somewhere between $35 million and $40 million in total. Okay, guys, awesome. Thank you so much Jerome, next question? Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. You are now live. Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. First one for Rick or Bren, I know you guys have not given out your guidance, but if I look at some of the commentary you made in terms of strength of foundry lasting into first half of '20 and NAND in first half and maybe DRAM in the second half of '20 recovering, is it fair to assume that your legacy KLA, the business is going to be up in calendar '20 versus calendar '19 and if so, what is the risk to that guesstimate? And then I had a follow-up. Yes, so let me take the first part and then give it to Bren. So we're not going to call it legacy. It's a process control business now that we have other businesses and the trajectory is good. We're going to get into more discussion of the outlook at our Analyst Day next month, but definitely, we feel like things are coming our way in terms of the right kind of market momentum, the advanced design rule work that's going on. In addition, some of the competitive dynamics, we talked about Gen 5 strengthening and some new projects, new products hitting the market. So we feel very good about overall position and Bren can talk in broader terms. Yes, I think we feel pretty good about logic, foundry and sustainability of spend levels into 2020. So I think if you look across those end markets and you look at the activity there. We would expect to see continued investment. We talked about competitive dynamics, the strength of the 7 nanometer node out there is also limiting how much reuse customers can do, and so that's certainly having an effect as well. You'll see automotive and industrial hopefully start to come back next year and so as you think about the broader demand across all of logic, foundry, I think there are a number of drivers that give us some confidence moving into next year about those segments. Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up, you guys, introduce a new e-beam wafer defect review product recently and I'm kind of curious, how do we think about the coexistence of Gen 5 and e-beam down the road for your product portfolio and is this e-beam kind of just targeted towards specialized applications, so just kind of curious on how to think about the lay of the land for your products? Thank you. Well, I think what we said all along is we think there is a complementary role for optical and e-beam and this continues that. I think that what we have in our latest technology is a very capable e-beam tool that when our customers utilize with our advanced optical they really get the best of both in terms of capabilities for the market. But I don't think there will ever be a day where there is not a complementary e-beam solution with optical.
Optical keeps getting better, e-beam has to get better too, but I think the general mix between e-beam and optical will remain about the same in terms of the way customers spend their dollars. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the market and we think the synergy of having our optical tool, coupled with our e-beam is really great for our customers trying to solve some of their very challenging problems. Thanks Rick. Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You are now live. Great, thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding your expectations for sustainability of foundry, strength to continue through 2020. I guess within that could you speak to, I guess both your positioning within Gen 5 EUV, e-beam, perhaps new products that you haven't announced yet, but you just highlighted? And then also from an end market perspective in terms of rising competition as you look at Samsung coming in, we'd love to hear, I guess in more detail your thoughts on that front? Yes. So, this is Rick. I'll talk more sentiment than actual numbers in terms of 2020 because we really don't know, but you can always to higher customer is behaving and what the mood is in the market. And right now we're actually in a situation where we see a lot of energy around our customers pushing for new capability, pushing for getting their advanced designs out, you see a lot of tape-outs, the mask business has been good, so definitely feel strong.
The other thing and not to be missed, what Bren mentioned is, we don't see a lot of reuse happening because of some of the challenges of the new technologies. So that was something that we were trying to really map out and see what it was going to look like and the combination of new capability on our side, new challenges on our customer side, make us feel like it looks very strong in terms of the momentum.
How long into '20, we don't really have great visibility into that. It's just now we have a case where you've got multiple players really concerned about bringing out new technology and ramping new devices, and at the same time we're hitting with some products that are new to the market and very exciting for us. Very helpful, thank you. As my follow-up, could you I guess speak a little bit to your expectations for growth in the service bucket, both for process control as well as for overall Orbotech? Yes, CJ, so in process control for those process control customers we believe we have a long-term trajectory somewhere in that 9% to 10% CAGR opportunity over time. We're adding tools to the installed base at a much faster rate than they're coming off, so that creates opportunities for us. 75% of that revenue stream is contract based because of customers desire to keep those tools up and how they buy process control also just a general complexity of what we sell. So that's good for that business. We've seen it slow a little bit in the near term related to just some of the idling of capacity that's well understood in the market. But over the long run we've seen it grow at that rate and we expect it to continue to grow like at that rate over time.
The PCB business for Orbotech it has a strong service profile, say 95% of the tools are under contract, so of the PCB revenue we reported about 40% of it is service stream. So because of the imaging technology and the need for that tool as enabling for circuit boards, that's a positive trend for that business.
I think on the flat panel side, there is very little service activity in terms of some consumable parts that are attractive, but there is some opportunity there for us certainly. And on specialty semiconductors, as we think about how we try to leverage our position in working with customers to offer better solutions over time there might be an opportunity for us to help customers that way on the specialty side.
Smaller companies always have a harder time with service just the broader footprint. So maybe what we end up doing is enabling a better cost position for both flat panel and for specialty semi, but a lot of opportunity for us moving forward I think in terms of driving that straightforward for the company. Thanks, Bren. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You are now live. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. First on gross margins, so you're guiding gross margins up 160 basis points or so, 60% or 61%, what's driving that and should we expect margins to continue to expand as your sales potentially grow again in December? Well, as I said last quarter, I thought there were some unique effects affecting the June quarter from an overall mix perspective in our semi-process control business. Not all our products carry the same margin and under 606 it's whatever you ship is ultimately what you revenue. So some of that was a bit dilutive to our margins, drove the margins down to the almost just short of 59%. Moving forward, obviously we have some growth in revenue and that's helpful.
We're seeing a reversion sort of back to a normalized mix on the process control side and I'm expecting to see stronger and higher utilization rates out of the service business in some higher margins in the service overall. So all those are driving us into the 60% to 61% range and I would expect to see that as we move into next quarter as well. So a normalizing effect that I telegraphed last quarter off of the June number, and it seems like that's where we expect to see the overall as we move into the next six months or so. Got it. And for my follow-up. Rick, I'm curious how resilient has your core process control services business been in this cyclical downturn versus what do you assume what went well what did not go as well. Every time we get into a downturn, we always hope for the resilience of that business, but I'm just curious as you look back, how resilient it actually was over the last several quarters? Yes, sure. It was pretty resilient. I think that as Bren mentioned, there was a little bit of softening we saw, but overall, we still see healthy growth rate. It was a little bit under what's been modeled for the long term, but we actually think we'll catch back up with that long-term modeling for a lot of reasons. I mean, I think that the utilization on some of the fabs has obviously been decreased, but there the service base is so large now and there's a lot of value in keeping those tools up and running. So we feel pretty good about it. Still, and I think the slowest quarter was still in load upper single digits, so pretty good about 8%. Yes. Back in the worst downturn we've ever had, I mean it's always held up pretty well. Right? And it's, I think the other thing about that business for us is it's bigger now right? And it's growing faster than the systems business. So bigger is the percent of the total, so a solid anchor with we believe an earnings stream that's accretive to the overall.
So, I think the dynamics are intact. It goes to the points earlier about how customers buy service that they need the tools up, they need matching performance, there's general complexity that's hard to deal with and for all those reasons, they tend to rely on us and want a contract stream to ensure the uptime of those products and even in difficult environments they still tend to run the tools and there is a certain amount of business that is there for us. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You are now live. Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the gross margin puts and takes for some of the new products that you launched last month. Can you just help us or remind us how we should think about this gross margins ramping over time. Yes, you know, Joe, it's something we've been talking about. I mean, anytime, and it really goes back to how we introduced products at KLA. Typically when we're bringing products out into the market our focus is on use case validation and driving applications and adoption. And so, we usually come out with a product, we're trying to prove it out, and the margins typically are a little bit lower than what I would say the mature iteration of the previous platform. Then the engineering team starts to design for cost, we start to look at ways to second source.
And as we introduce new subsequent iterations to the product that the margin profile improves. So, any time we have a new one come out, it is a little bit lower and then over time it catches back up. So it did have an effect on the margin profile as I mentioned in the prior quarters and I think we'll see that play out as we move over the rest of this year and into next year. With a big portfolio like we have, we tend to see some products where there are different stages of that maturity cycle, so they tend to offset each other.
But, generally, part of what we do at KLA is ensure the value of what we deliver to customers in terms of how we price and discipline around that. So we ensure that what we are able to deliver product-by-product is pretty consistent and usually over time, we're able to drive more and more value out of it and I would say that we're not any different today with the latest round of products. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the e-beam side I was just curious if you could share any kind of early customer feedback that you've gotten so far, maybe how should we think about the initial ramp for adoption of that solution? The industrial feedback and we're still, we're out in a number of sites and we're getting feedback and we're doing demos, feedback is good. We're not ready to start modeling it into the numbers yet, because it does take a while to get the adoption of these platforms going, but we feel pretty good about the technical capability and the production worthiness. It does as I say, take a little while for customers to adopt enough to contribute meaningfully when we're at a $5 billion run rate. Yes, I would say the portfolio approach that we have these products fit with the portfolio. You've got common capabilities across the tools, common algorithms, common other options and that help drive out - incremental performance out of the inspectors. So with the review or even baseline ground truth reference tools it helps sort of enable the broader franchise. So that's the approach we've taken at KLA, it matters more than ever today with the challenges in the production process, the size of the defects, the noise that happens on the wafer. So across all of that, having those capabilities that independently are tough to sometimes markets aren't always all that big, but collectively across the portfolio, create a lot of value for our customers. Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. You are now live. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the nice results and outlook. I'm really just wondering, you mentioned the strength on the Gen 5 tool, you guys introduce the fifth iteration of Gen 4 last month, just wondering what demand you're seeing for the older Gen 4 systems as Gen 5 ramps? Well, it's, think of it like a lithography mix and match. So what you get is, you end up with customers deploying the most cost effective solution they can that has the capability that they need and that really cascades starting with e-beam, then getting to 39xx than 29xx, and then the new Voyager platform. So it's really - the easier layers are harder than they used to be on the advanced node. So customers will deploy where they can the Gen 4 and then they'll put Gen 5 up against the problems when that's the only way to really solve them. Did that answer your question? That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the China question, you referenced some puts and takes, but generally, perhaps a strengthening in that market versus 90 days ago. Do you have any sense as to the demand strength, I mean you're seeing more of a timing shift where projects are getting pulled in or do you think that this is just an acceleration in the roadmap for some of those indigenous Chinese fabs? Thanks. I don't think it's as much about, - I think what happens is, there is uncertainty may be about their own plans and their ability to procure tools. So that may be pushed it out and then when they realized they could do it, pulled it back in. I don't want to speak for them, but I think it's more that the projects getting solidified. And I think 90 days ago maybe that was more on par is to see if they can even get the tool sets. So that's kind of where we are. It's not so much about end demand. I don't think as them staying on some of their plans. And by the way, there are a lot more programs there that we already derated. If you go back a couple of years ago and had listened to what customers have said, we're getting closer and closer to what we anticipated for 2019 and a going run rate for 2020. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You are now live. Thank you. If you look at the capacity build for the upcoming 5 nanometers, how do you think the rate at which the capacity is being built is compared to previous, now let's say, to 7 nanometer or 10 nanometers? Wafer that the pilot line for 5 nanometers, could be little bit bigger than in the past, but just want to hear from your perspective of what is driving that kind of changes? Yes, I think that, and I'll go first here. I mean, we are seeing a little bit stronger adoption level and to the point earlier, you're seeing less migration of other tools from previous nodes, and so that's driving a certain amount of activity. I would expect it will probably be somewhere between 80 and 90 k wafer starts and for 5 nanometers get into that sort of through the first part of 2020 or maybe that's towards the end of 2020. So I would say that because of some of those other dynamics related to 7 we're seeing perhaps more activity for us on the 5 nanometer node. Okay, maybe. And then my follow-up question is on the China strength that you guys expect in the second half. It seems that you guys talk about the DRAM project being pulled in, but my understanding is that, is that true that a lot of that revenue you have already seen it, because it seems like they have gone, most of those customers have gone past the initial yield improvement stage and from here on out, it's more on the production level type of run rate? Well, like I said, I mean there some puts and takes in the overall level of business in China. I think it's slightly better than what we thought before, but there is some rationalization of wafer capacity that's happening likely as well. So, while you do have some strength around this because DRAM project, you do have some other moving parts. I think the way to think about this business is more about proving out technology roadmaps and then moving on to the next node.
So there is some amount of capacity that gets added, but then there is a lot of effort to progress down the technology roadmap, and because of that we're seeing more engagement than you otherwise might, because yes yields are slightly improving on the trailing node that they happen to move to the next node, then they are challenged again and need to upgrade certain parts of the tool set.
So that's driving a more continuous level of business, not just with this customer, but with other customers. And you might see when you're at some node and then go ramp it to significant volume production as and you'd see in one of the leading-edge memory fabs. It's a little different behavior smaller fabs and more of a focus on trying to move down the technology curve than then just ramping a lot of capacity. All right, that's helpful, thanks. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. He will now. Your line is now live Good afternoon, this is Brian Chin on for Patrick. Thanks for allowing us ask a few questions. Maybe a few questions on the PCB and flat panel markets, PCB first, the overlay of Huawei might also cloud things a little bit here, but of the major Smartphone ecosystems, it sounds like China has been a laggard in terms of adoption of [indiscernible] line space SLP and SAP manufacturing. So have you begun to see the China leader or leaders begin to adopt to the Orbotech, or now KLA, imaging products this year or are we still earlier on this adoption curve for them as we - and maybe you'll see that more as we move into next year? Yes, it's still not yet. I think we do expect that to see that and the current expectation is, as you say it's probably next year, probably the third guys to do that. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe pivoting to the flat panel, from an early planning perspective, obviously a week spending year environment this year, but do you see any lead indicators, early indicators through for your product lines, like the AI [ph] tool that suggests we could see a meaningful pickup in the spending environment come next year and if you do, does this increase your urgency to pull in some of the cost synergies relative for that 24-month horizon? We don't, right. It's too early for us right now to see 2020 picking up. I do think we had some marginal improvement, off of a bottom, but I would say that it's probably later than that. And to your point, we are actively working some of the synergy programs there. All right, thank you. We have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You are now live. Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-up question. On the strong adoption of the Gen 5 wafer inspection platforms, this I think it was originally targeted for sub-7 nanometer nodes over. We keep hearing that customers are adopting Gen 5 for yield improvement even at some of the older nodes, and we also hear that Gen 5 has been adopted earlier by the memory guys. And then you also have EUV print check as another use case. So, how much of these types of buyers are driving the strength in shipments this year versus the real leading edge development activities? We haven't thought about it in those terms. I probably half and half, though, I mean if I thought about it. It's broad use in development. I think what happens in especially since we make improvements to it and drive the productivity of the tool up, then it starts to be competitive in terms of cost of ownership with some applications for Gen 4. But a lot of this, as you might imagine, the discovery aspect of a new product is, you're not really sure what it's going to find and what value, it's going to create.
So now what we're seeing is significant value as you say, even in some maybe more traditional places and frankly what we originally expected was, in some places people might have tried to deploy e-beam inspection, they get away from that by leveraging the much higher throughput of the optical platform. So we kind of see it broadening and feel very good. It took a little while, but we feel very good about the progress there. I think the customers are seeing more and more demand, more and more activity at these other nodes to that that's driving more yield challenges, and so now the tool is faster and so the debugging challenges they're having at even at prior nodes now using the Gen 5 capability to Rick's point, you have a whole bunch -- whole lot of headroom add that enable customers to use that tool for full wafer coverage type yield analysis that didn't exist without the Gen 5 product line out there. So, given the demand there, and how much activity is happening across new designs at those nodes, you're seeing more debugging that's happening there as well. So, just one last dynamic, I think you may know that what a lot of customers do is, it takes them a while to prove out the capability of the tool before they release it even internally for broad years. And so what we've seen in the last couple of quarters as we've kind of broken through at some critical places where they have broader ability now to deploy outside of the first people who were just evaluating it. So that really opens up a number of use cases and hence the significant progress in Gen 5. Yes, thanks for the insights. Thank you. Harlan. That's all the time we have for today's call.

I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights.
Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand.
As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries.
Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.
Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace.
Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment.
KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model.
In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019.
Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond.
We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership.
This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques.
We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base.
As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses.
Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day.
Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well.
I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren? Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion.
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech.
During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks.
Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020.
As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations.
I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year.
On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%.
In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%.
Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%.
Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter.
Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings.
Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base.
In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact.
Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%.
Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year.
For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share.
Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share.
With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A. Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to ensure we get as through as many questions as possible. With that Charlie, we are ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions]
You first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double-digit. And based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9% - 11%. So curious is that the right math? And then as part of that what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020 presumably a year with more memory which is an obvious negative, however, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at NAND as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE both good and bad in 2020. Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment.
So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point. Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that that's much more of a second half Apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of kind of range first half second half kind of mix there. I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well. Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year 2019. According to my calculations your services business was up about 111% and the upper end of your long term target of 9% to 11%. On your full-year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar 2020 based on your installed base growth in 2019 how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar 2020? So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated.
I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019. Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been draw of -- that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles right. Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example. So that then can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs like x-ray for stack profiling, e-beam both for wafer and medical maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues. Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there.
So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing. Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020. The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now. Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. Thanks very much. Could you give us some ideas to what percent of your semi equipment sales out to domestic Chinese chipmakers? I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue. Okay. Great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, of course confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea about what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech? Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks a lot. So, Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019, I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875 in last September you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year, but if I add together Intel and TSMC CapEx, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there or how you sort of -- how you sort of reconcile those numbers? Thanks. So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019. Yes, Bren. I guess I was talking second half of 2019 versus second half of 2018. Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 -- Yes. Basically --barely up. Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million. I guess the question is you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic so why would it be up so little when those guys CapEx is up massively. I mean it's up 30 plus percent. Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period. Got it, Rick. Okay. So it's a timing issue, okay. Thanks. Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018. Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue. Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well. Okay. Awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you --were you referring to Export Control that could come about or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? Thanks. No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Santor with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two one. First one for either Rick or Bren. If a look at your March quarter guidance, looks like sequentially foundries up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly in an environment where people think foundry logic CapEx is front half loaded, should we assume that's how your revenues have to trend or is it tough to say at this point? And then I have a follow up. Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year. Got it. And then just as a follow-up if the memory recoveries wouldn't be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile? There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question, Bren, in your prepared comments you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the Coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious is that through the EPS as well or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, had a higher revenue midpoint. Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance.
So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now. That's helpful. And then as my follow on, Rick, it's always helpful when you get kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit; your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year 2020. Wondering if you endorsed that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE and your business this year? Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance.
But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended. John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast.
But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking a conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now, do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here or do you think that there is a chance for catch up here? Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe. Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now. Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that is it a difference between NAND or DRAM process control intensity? There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements.
So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need. Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the Coronavirus impacts. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain or have you received changes in terms of demand signals from customers or if you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative? Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details. But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so. And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out. Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half, but if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year that would be helpful. Thank you. Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looked to be in a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles. And then are those net new opportunities or are they competitive to put displacements? Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND. Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market.
To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute. That's healthful. And then just as a quick follow up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020? I apologize I missed it. Is that still flat year-over-year? No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year. Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. Just to following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory CapEx recoveries more second half but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamics in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year? Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year. Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow up is, sorry if this has been asked earlier but last quarter you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half over half in the first half of calendar 2020. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger does that change the slope of that and assuming that the Coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year. And how should we think about first half over second half for this year? I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business.
End of Q&A We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters. Thank you and thank you everyone for your time and interest in KLA, today.

With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17th Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance.
A result of strong customer pool for KLA solutions and focused execution despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments. As a global leader in process control and supplier of process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry.
Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio, and differentiated solutions that address our customer's most complex challenges is the recipe that sustained our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple megatrends driving demand across multiple product generations and numerous key industries.
Please turn the Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the Company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses.
The KLA operating model is essential to align the Company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.
Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that service our guide and drive our high performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent industry day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses including acquired ones with the focus on these key four objectives and it shows in our overall results published today.
Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights of the quarter, I'd like to provide some high level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technology supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continue device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment.
KLA strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum, we see due to support both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions.
Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019, at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019. With KLA semi-process control business inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018.
Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen 5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the events notes.
Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020 as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success. The accelerated adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen 5 demand in the near term. Also last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new e-beam inspection platform in several years.
I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial to performance. KLA's differentiate e-beam inspection platform works with Gen 5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes. Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA.
In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better than expected demand in the September quarter, helping to contribute to the revenue upsides we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology roadmaps.
And finally KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi-process control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%.
Several factors drive growth and our service businesses including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the install base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service businesses providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.
Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This was accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds in the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth.
Our focused on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day. 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives.
Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our process for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets, and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also mark a new record for the Company.
Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was 1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of 1.31 billion to 1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 16.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 50% to 60%, driven by incremental revenue growth and stronger than expected semi-process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of 1.75 to 2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively.
Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter is both capital operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of 496 million and 464 million. We're proud of our financial results this quarter and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.
A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17th, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the 10th consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it overtime as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
In terms of returning capital shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $220 million of common stock and also paid a $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon investing in restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitments to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced as the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program, resulting in $1.6 million available to repurchase under board authorization at quarter end.
Please turn to Slide 11 for review the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Revenue to the semi-process control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the backwards strength and foundry logic. As Rick discuss in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 is approved modestly driven by investments and easy and stronger foundry demand.
In addition, increased demand for native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned founders very strong at approximately 44% of semi-process control revenue up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter. Logic was 13% of total semi crosses control revenue versus 12% last quarter.
I'll turn now to the especially semiconductor process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and Edge solutions and fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we were encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market.
Despite these near term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis the calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB display and Component inspection segment was $179 million down 3% sequentially in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's Component inspection business.
Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products in region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 32%, patterning which includes radical inspection was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%. PCB display and Component inspection revenue was 9%.
Other which includes Benchtop analytical instruments in the KLA pro mature product and enhancements business was 3%. Service is 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4% with the rest of Asia at 3%.
Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income expense in September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in taxes are related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S.
Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as a long term planning rate. Net income of $398 million and we had $160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total data $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies.
Please turn to Slides 15 to review free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we've averaged just over a 100% free cash flow conversion, and over the last 12 months has been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry leading gross margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.
Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitments to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout is increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years for the average price paying to repurchase shares been slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the Company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussion.
Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially roughly 4% of the midpoint in being range of 1.435 billion to 1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundries forecasted to be about 55% of semi-process control system revenue in the December quarter. To picking this rank we continue to see among our foundry customer base.
We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued segments we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi-process control system revenue next quarter. For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half.
Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we're modeling them to be approximately 385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarters due principally to the timing of non-headcount related product engineering expenses for next generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower cost locations. We would expect to see an impact from this activity through 2020 with the return on these investments beginning in 2021.
As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of 370 million to 375 million, as product development expenses normalized to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately 38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%.
For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share account of approximately 159 million shares.
In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments and what remains in environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across the broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance and we're encouraged by the momentum we've seen in our business.
Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or have to have trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019.
As customers continue to progress through technology roadmaps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversify in demand. For memory, we expect a better year in 2020 as disciplined supply management in 2019 has approved the overall condition of both segments.
Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control and foundry and logic, improving process control intensity and memory and contributions from new products. Calendar 2020 is setting up another year relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we reported earnings for the December quarter.
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin. Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question.
With that, Christian, we're ready for the first question. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen 5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 and to that still be a good growth driver in 2020. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense from you where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time, do you think we are maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it? And as you think about logic, foundry being strong next year, to what extent is that just a call or laundry, on logic foundry CapEx versus perhaps a Gen 5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating? Yes, I think, if I thought about Gen 5 right now, and you want to use baseball at third inning, it's relatively early in the life. We were now in the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform and there is several iterations to follow. Engineering has been dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption, and really the beginning of adoption in production where what we really have been dealing with for the most part in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle.
So, we're still early on and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become an HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is we seen more memory adoption in the Gen 5 memory we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we've originally envisioned. John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about in our Investor Day, there is an application for radical qualification in the fabs for EUV radicals. So, where as we start to progress that use case is how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticle as they're being used in the wafer fab. So, the incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen 5 as it gets adopted. And Bren, maybe just for my follow-up, I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analysts Day, around op margin sort of bridge between now and 2023. You're already kind of the head of the revenue, op margin targets you gave in that model, both in the September quarter and in the December guide. And it sounds like December OpEx is unusually high for your comments and in general that op margin target that you gave only assumed incremental op margins to low end of your historical guidance. I hate the obsolete the model listen to quarter out, but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside of conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day? Yes, John, it's a good question. I think one of the challenges and putting gathers as a model as it reflects a different mix of business that we have today, but also expected moving forward. So clearly in the September quarter and even in December, what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business. And that is beginning consistent with we've historical model that we've had out there.
So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we try to reflect was based on our expectations for growth overtime, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are in embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. I guess first question on the foundry logic side of things. Can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and then really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that, if you could speak to also reuse that clearly was a headwind, basically from 20-nanometer down, but it sounds like 7 non-EUV progressing to 5 EUV, but that's a seismic shift here, but it's driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of things? I'll take the question and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry logic is, it's not particularly broadly expected to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts, design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there's so many different devices that are being introduced to these advanced nodes.
So, we don't suspect that they'll be that much. The other thing is we have new product cycle which really adding a lot of capability. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible, but we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns, and all some of the additional challenges the advanced nodes are pushing. Even without brought EUV and once you brought out EUV get even more of that. I think that the big difference between this nodes and let's say 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader and market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse is that capacity is deploy to support all that activity. And a high mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product window. So it's a good story and we expect this node to have some legs and certainly the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and stronger expectations for that. If I could speak in a quick second question, you talked about a return to 370, 375 OpEx in margin. I just curious, how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020? Yes, CJ, as I outlined at Investor Day is a number of activities that are happening and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint.
So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line will be operating in that range as we move through the year with, the usual program development, expenses that could cause from one direction or the other.
I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range, as we move towards the end of the year and begin the year is probably at the higher end. The next question is from Krish Santor from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. I just have a quick one, Rick. I know you've kind of spoke about how Gen 5 is going to double in 2020. Is that finally coming from foundry 5 nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption too? So, Krish, that was -- the comments were that we thought a doubling in '19 from '18, although to Rick's earlier point about Gen 5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in terms of how it supports EUV radical qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen 5. But we haven't quantify you know how much more I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity goes for 7 nanometer for 5. But you'll see more adoption of Gen 5 when production is Gen 5. And then just add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer in terms of the early evaluation and use as it sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19 where we got it up and established in all the leading jobs. Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing as I look at the order profile, it would imply -- we're going to have growth in the number of unites as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. The next question is from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is open. On EUV lithography adoption in your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think you could gather that your radical inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year, up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML, let's say, over the next couple of years, it's still a runway for very strong growth around 25%, 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mass inspection business looking into next year? Yes, I mean, I think Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE and reticle inspection, and that's been adoption for the Teron inspection, and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So, we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer size as we see incremental capacity there, and then you'll start to see, some activity as we move into next year.
As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that will start shipping in 2020 also. So, you'll see a mix and match, but as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV. We believe we've got the market pretty well serve with the capability that we're offering. And then on the specialty semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so, again, if I look at the trends heading into next year, you've got a big step up in RF content in 5G smartphones and infrastructure. You've got more power products in auto and industrial and of course all these events, packaging and things like system in package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year, but I wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS? Right, well, obviously we're newer to that business, but as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers. It does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. 20 looks like a good year for SPTS and our current modeling of it based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G. It looks like a, hopefully a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So, we feel good about it and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year, you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share. But I think a lot of people are looking at fabric FX, and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak, at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers, like we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity, point of view for non-memory. So, also people are looking at TSMC CapEx, and it's kind of 5 billion in Q4 and that's kind of $20 billion run rate. So, how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of the near-term peak in foundry and logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipping rates continuing to grow in foundry and logic next year? Thanks. Well, it is true that we have strength as we mentioned the year half on half, considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers, there are other customers that will broaden out in next year. And so we feel pretty good about how we're position. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing.
So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half of this year. But we're counting on some broadening and again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefits of that revenue next year. Bren, do you want to add any color to that? No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year is from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified in demand environment into next year. We feel comfortable with given the comments we may in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability and foundry and logic is moving to 2020. And then I guess I had a question on Orbotech, if you look at systems revenue, it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December brand for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat panel display in the PCB business? I guess the real question is, why is the flat panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much, much lower margin. So just, can you just kind of talk through all that? Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that, it looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter lead time there that those deliveries happen in December and that business is a bill to order business for us and when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well.
So I would expect it to uptick. I think, as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after six years of growth, we saw 2020, our 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020, either. So, we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your point. And we're some of the actions we're taking that I refer to in terms of cost structure, cost reduction actions are particular to that business.
And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability, these truck levels and position that we can, as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first, I hear your point and we'll see how it plays out over time. The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. I had two questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious what is the right way to think about process control intensity in EUV versus non-EUV? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year, do you think it is a bigger factor? Yes, process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers I mean, obviously the value of the EUV is reduction in layers. And so we would see that that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV but you really get process control intensity in a couple ways. One, you get it in the mash off because you have to do more inspection to ensure that you have a high quality mask and we're still as an industry trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, non-pellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask.
The other thing is in print check to verify and validate that the Bren mentioned in earlier question, we see rather than opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA. And my follow-up, how large was domestic China's plans for you this year? And just conceptually, how are you thinking about it going into next year? Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said the remarks I mean, at the beginning year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18 and it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up with about flat.
And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in. But it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the Company. And I would expect that to stay, it's relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. That is not part of outperformance assumption for next year? No, I think, look, it is, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly it improved the performance in with a factor and performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year. No, I don't, I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of our planning. I expect a flattish environment in China. The next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. I just wanted to follow up on the question for our Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assumed that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So, as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then 1 Alpha processes. Do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps, as we see EUV coming into high volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Yes, I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense again for the same reasons you have the mask shop and you have on the wafer and you have a reduction of layers counter balancing it. I don't think there's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of say, 10% process control intensity, you might get half a point to a point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it'll also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do, have pellicles. It will change a little bit how it plays out for us. And then follow up question just it sounds like, you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business, and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guide. But just wondering, if you could comment based on sort of orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing and starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to sort of the customers at this point, you wouldn't call it kind of the mitigating of a broader base recovery? No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18. And so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which ultimately supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that that impacts. So I wouldn't say it that isn't a leading indicator of new business. But certainly given the market position and that products and how memory drives wafers, it easy to pick up in memory, we will see, will do so that will see that business impacted. The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. As it relates to your service business, I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen particularly on the memory side and your installed base, and maybe how do we think about that relative to the gross margin guide for the December quarter? Yes, I know, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing and drove an uptick in the revenue level for service, quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So, look you do have a gross margin impact to growth in service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally.
And I think you keep in mind is with our service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe is in a creative stream to the overall total. So, it's not affecting I think quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin, in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. And then on the specialty semi side, now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand it -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand? Yes, I would say, the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter, so we continue to see that and we talked about, if I recall in $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular, there are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean and Osats. So there are a number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business down the long run, as those customers in that area or the any customer, the customers customer service to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us
So, but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing I think a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in, and we'd expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier. But, business has really good market position, I think the long term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging power and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see and we like the business models of that business. Yes, and more specifically, I think on Huawei it's not about. The reactions of the suppliers to Huawei, it was -- there was uncertainty when the first came and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So, the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain, so we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now, I think people are dealing with it and that'll actually cause the business to resume its growth. The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is open. Maybe first off, in the past, you talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side, things particularly latest increase, as the industry starts shifting to 128 layers, do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side, given the complexity of layers then the increased number of layers for next generation devices? I think the main opportunity. It's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really and what's happening on the bear wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher both cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects in the trenches, but it's probably more flatness driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where I've really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities we talked about at the end of this day with the work we have on CD Sacks in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection is more about Surfscan. My follow up question in terms of the domestic China opportunity, obviously we're seeing some of this capacity built again and you're benefiting from new capacity build up. But giving some of it is also trailing edge logic type of capacity, those is simply because their new capacity, or are there opportunities within the, I guess the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities both for years, especially in metrology products? Yes, I think there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale in terms of what you think about it's a larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain, if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region, reasons. So that kind of creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that.
Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share, but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto is China's important auto market. There are more specialty semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China, not by much, I'd say probably of our mix semiconductor business is 55, 45 to memory. And look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So, to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT, we're talking about automotive. And so the yields learning challenges and logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shipping are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade path as they start to progress, some of their technology.
So, and they're serving, I think real markets, ultimately. And so I think they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment in their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. Your final question is from the Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. I just wanted to go back to the half over half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up, I guess, every quarter on a sequential basis, this year, a couple quarters ago. So I guess the question is based on, customer projects based on customer conversations. What are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on half over half basis? Thank you. Well, like I said, I think we're a little early guide second half or have to have trajectories and obviously I think that this part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry.
I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half of 20-ish% over the first half, it does obviously imply, the WFE is higher in the first half or the second half versus first half. So the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year of these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half, you have to have that kind of growth to sort of sustain at this level of business, but I think that's probably as far as I can go with this point. Yes, I guess what I would add to that is, we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're now in a great position to predict WFE. Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up, on China, on native China WFE, I think Bren, you talked about 2020. At least at this point kind of looking kind of flattest relative to 2019, when you think about the mix of spend on process control, does that move higher or what are your preliminary thoughts on that? Yes, I know, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business and we expect them expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So not expecting, at least for our business, not expecting growth and not expecting decline in 2020 at this point, we'll see how it plays out, but that's where we where we stand today. Thank you and that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks. Yes. Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for your time today and interest in KLA. Christian, please conclude the call. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today’s extraordinary circumstances.
For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I’ll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook.
In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It’s also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We’re confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future.
Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations.
Today’s environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries.
We’re also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We’ve also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we’re working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers.
There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021.
Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership.
Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We’re forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target.
Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We’re very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We’re also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets.
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception.
Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Bren. Thanks, Rick. KLA’s June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies.
Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63.
Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems’ revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans.
In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%.
for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share.
as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we’d like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur.
the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA’s strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges.
with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range.
With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06.
In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we’re on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A. Sure, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. your line is now open. good afternoon, solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry’s supply chain, as well as demand trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today, supply chain has come back semiconductor fundamentals while we can, June or as fully showing signs of improvement entering the second half of the year. If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on December, it looks like you will be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low-double digits percentage revenue goal for this calendar year first. is that a fair assumption and maybe some commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre-COVID-19 earlier this year? Hey, Harlan, it’s Bren and I’ll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the – within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don’t think things have changed all that much. I mean, you’re right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we’ve worked through all that and we’ve got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would – so I don’t want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to – or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it. Great. Thanks for that. And you entered the June quarter, I remember what the view of strong specialty semiconductor trends, but maybe, more meta trends within some of your other EPC segments like PCB and display as these are more consumer and sort of auto focused – automotive focus segments for you guys and probably, more impacted by COVID-19. but you’ve got it delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth in the PCB, display and component inspection business. So, what drove these solid trends and how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move through the second half of this year? Yes. thanks, Harlan. We’re really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to – when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that’s really the ICOS business. We’re also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that’s not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we’re following through on the conversations we’ve had on display, where we’re working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is – the other thing that’s really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business.
So that’s really upside as we go forward. I think it’s pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about – it’s pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year – this year and then into 2021, we’ll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level. Hey, Harlan, it’s bren. The only other thing I’ll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick’s point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB. Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Yes. good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential growth. I’m wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the semi process control or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess importantly, do you think that the June quarter and now growth into September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix? Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we’re seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that’s having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we’re seeing there, I’m encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position.
So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we’re experiencing right now. Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over the first half, I’m kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of memory and logic/foundry, and how might that have changed over the last 90 days? I don’t want to words in your mouth, but it sounds like maybe, you’re less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps more optimistic about logic/foundry sustaining, and if that’s the case in any read as we go into calendar year 2021. Yes. We do see we see – we think there’s a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we’re getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that’s really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that’s I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we’re also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up. Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and company. Your line is now open. Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one either Rick or Bren, clearly, like two of your largest logic and foundry customers have spoken about push out of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the foundry side. with the backdrop, how do you think of KLA’s process control revenue opportunity over the next year or two, given that some of the leading-edge nodes are getting pushed out and then I have a follow-up? Yes. There’s really nothing that’s been discussed publicly that hadn’t been the way we’d been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it’s pretty much consistent with what we’ve seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it’s much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There’s plenty of demand at the leading edge. It’s the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we’re heavily involved in.
So, we think that there’s a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that’s part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that’s going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we’re helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we’ve been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense? Yes, yes. that does. thanks a lot, Rick. And then just to follow-up on the product side, you guys introduced pattern wafer e-beam inspection to look semicon. I’m just trying to figure it out, is your e-beam tool still focused on defect detection, or you feel looking at pattern facility of voltage contract, and your competent isn’t going to like multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So, you just want to figure out the e-beam roadmap. Thank you. Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for – to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they’re really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they’re looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it’s closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that’s what we’re seeing.
We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn’t have reentered the market if we didn’t feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that’s the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we – as we map out the future, we don’t see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution. Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. your line is now open. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your prepared comments, regarding memory and a greater breadth of spending into Q4 and then beyond into 2021. We’d love to hear kind of what you’re hearing in dialogue with customers there. Yes, CJ. it’s bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter’s memory. It’s lighter than in June. So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn’t all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we’d see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn’t exactly sure when we’d see it. But as we’ve – so it looks like it’s more December focused. And it – I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there’s solid momentum as we move into next year.
I don’t want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we’ve seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market’s in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021. That’s helpful. As my follow-up for the PCB display and component business including service, how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus the first half? And then as part of that, how should we be thinking about seasonality in terms of peak quarter Q3 versus Q4 given how dominant PCB is within the construct there. Thank you. Yes, SPTS, I would – it potentially could be flattish half to half. We’ll have to see how it plays out. I think PCB second half will be slightly – it will probably be lower in the second half, given what’s driven that the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the second half there. on the flat panel business, I wouldn’t expect much to change on that front. It is a 100% consumer focus. There’s virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there’s a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that’s still being worked through. So, I don’t expect any growth; in fact, maybe, second half might be flat to modestly down in that business. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. Hi. thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Just maybe, following up CJ’s question about the memory span and timing, typically memory is a little bit more metrology biased versus say logic and foundry being a little more inspection biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries, because what I’m trying to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction with process tools? So, am I looking at that correctly or are there still “lead time” in terms of metrology shipments relative to process tools? that’s a good question. Certainly metrology, certain parts of metrology, like in film measurement and overlay tends to scale with capacity, but you also have on patterned inspection that scales also with capacity on the patterned inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development process itself. So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don’t think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that’s how it plays out. Great. That’s helpful. And maybe, Bren as a follow-up, in terms of the opex management, you probably have gotten some savings over the last several months due to COVID-19 and the diminishing of travel and things of that nature, as we get back to a more normalized environment, how do you balance some of the increases that will come from that versus these attractive OpEx levels that you’re achieving today? Yes, that’s a good question. And we’re probably operating right now, $10 million to $15 million below what I’d considered to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process – this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we’re going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through – 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins.
So, for every incremental dollar of revenue, we’re probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that’s the way that if our incremental gross margins are above 60%. So, it’s a way to think about it. So, we’re going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that’s why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we’ve got the best products out there and we continue to innovate. And so we’re going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term model. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. your line is now open. Thanks a lot. So Bren, I guess that my first question is on the process control revenue. So, [Technical Difficulty] down in June, and I know that, there was maybe, some difficult comps, because of the Q4 last year. but WFE in the first half of this year is definitely up and your process control shipments have been down in March and June, and – but it sounds like you think that you’re going to at least keep up with the WFE for the year. So that would imply a pretty big back half of the year, given what’s happened here in the first half?
Can you maybe, hold our hand a little bit and tell us why you seem to have lost like a little bit of share in the first half and maybe, why process control will be up so much and maybe, help us gauge how much will it be up in September? Are you talking 10% to 15% Q-on-Q? thanks. And then I have a follow-up. So Tim, we don’t really look at WFE spent half-to-half years. I just look at overall expectations and the way we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we’re mostly in line with the plan that we had and against the backdrop of, let’s say WFE levels that are mid, single-digit growth for the year. I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it’s such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement’s consistent for a process control segment as well. Bren, I guess to sum up… But half-to-half, I would expect it to be up. I would expect it to be up half-to-half. And I guess just on that point, can you give us a sense for where you think it’ll be in September and then I guess my follow-up was, you didn’t really purchase any shares in the quarter, which is kind of interesting, why not. Thanks. September, we guide the overall company and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses to meet our expectations. And so I don’t want to guide the semi PC business, but in terms of just overall expectations, I’d expect that business to grow mid single digits versus the June quarter. But that being said, if I’ve got strength in other parts of the company, and I may deploy resources in a different way that that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers, but at the end of the day, what we’re really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to their timing. But I would expect that mid single digit sort of quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment. your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you for taking my question. I think, Rick or Bren, you mentioned some signs of foundry demand perhaps sustaining into next year. I was hoping if you could give us some more color, because I think consensus seems to be that foundry demand could actually – possibly decline next year. And I realize it’s early, but from what you see today, is it possible that foundry demand could actually be positive next year? Yes, it’s really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it’s been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we’ve been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it’s a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there’s a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we’re seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes.
So, that’s what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we’re having and the – our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it’s made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick’s point, there’s a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there’s enough in-market demand at the leading edge that’s driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on.
So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim’s question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we – as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we’d expect that we’ll start our capital allocation program. We’ll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline. And if I could ask a quick follow-up, there are two big trends going on. So, TSMC appears to be getting stronger. So, there are fewer, perhaps a high-end, leading edge customers to go after. And then there is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, but I understand it’s probably same demand, but maybe, scattered across a more places that could cause some cyclicality and I don’t know, how do you think KLA is positioned, when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers, and then if there is more sovereign manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than do technology ships or yield improvement? Just how do these two big trends play out for KLA over the next few years? Thank you. I wouldn’t say there are fewer. So, I think if you look at leading edge investment and certainly, our expectations for what we’ve seen in this business, and what we expect going forward is to Rick’s earlier point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that’s in the marketplace versus what we’re doing internally. So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that’s out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries – if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows.
So, we feel pretty good about that. There’s a lot of end demand and there’s specific designs for those – for that demand. And so I think on the trailing edge side, there’s some start-up costs for new projects or maybe, inefficiency in the market. but over time, they’re building to specific markets and you might see some trading of capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly end demand, but also the technology scaling that’s now happening with EUV. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you’ve talked about opportunities for higher metrology intensity at NAND flash at higher layer counts. So, I’m just curious, as we go into this next memory spending cycle, relative to the half cycle, how do we – how should we think about just your opportunity there for kind of the peak cycle revenues relative to the last cycle? Yes. I’ll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we’ve seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that’s something that we’re pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we’ve already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach.
The other thing that’s interesting and we didn’t necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they’re back moving forward, we have some product capability. We’ve learned how to solve some of these problems and we’re engaged closely with customers.
So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue. It’s not just design rules as you know, but the challenges in the increased number of layers. So, Bren from a standpoint of the numbers. Yes. I think we’ve seen process control share of WFE increased two to three points from the transition from planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick’s point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we’re working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we’ve seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward.
On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it’s one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there’s also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify in your prepared remarks; you talked about the new U.S. restrictions. Is there a change in that at all, relative to what you’ve talked about last quarter, in terms of, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about difficult to predict the near-term dynamics relate to those? Well, and it was – and we had to go through the exercising, the exercise as did our peer companies, of determining whether or not we were, how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think, all the peer companies have gone through that exercise and we’ve been able to navigate that. As we said, we’re going to obviously follow the law. It was just – there was some uncertainty as to what exactly how to interpret it. So, we’ve had the benefit of working through those details and feel like we’ve moved on from that. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your business in China, it’s been pretty stable as a percentage of revenues. How is that mix shifting between multinationals and China sovereign kind of customers? And what are you seeing specifically from China sovereign customers? We’re seeing growth this year. And so you’ve got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So, my growth statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be 20% or more. So, I think WFE levels in China, for the native China customers are – is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. So, it certainly is growth this year and it’s more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure centric. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open. Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and good job on the results and guide. Good to see EPC delivering records in the June quarter. I have a question on 5G, your 5G smartphone exposure on the PCB side gives you an edge over your peers, have based on our work and perhaps the higher stock multiple, how much of the PCB system and services revenues are 5G exposed on an annual basis? So, when we’re looking at it right now, it’s about 50%, and it feels like the success that we’ve had there, as you point out, we’ve got good exposure, we’ve got good products to serve those customers. And we feel like that’s, this is early days where the 5G build-out. So, we think there’s continued opportunity there as we go forward. Great. And then Rick, there was a question earlier on delay at the U.S. logic maker. longer-term, I see you have better exposure to foundry versus that logic maker based on your 10-K, is that shipped up capacity from the U.S. logic maker to Taiwan foundry, potentially neutral for your logic opportunity or a modest positive? It’s really hard to say. I mean, I think part of what we’ve experienced over time is that there are customers that historically, we’ve seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on leading edge and their engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment. So, what we’re seeing now is, people that feel like they’re needing to catch up are investing more to do that. But I think it’s pretty clear, if you want to stay on the leading edge of a lot of logic and foundry, and you don’t have the ability to fully understand and the learning cycles in the fab, you’re going to struggle.
So anybody, that’s trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile. That’s why – what’s really good for us as people that want to do advanced node technology, because they need to invest. And so I would say that if it moves it’s because that they’ve struggled, and if they want to be successful, then they end up investing more.
So, I think that what’s really good for KLA’s advanced nodes and the desire people have to support them. I think in – as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren’t all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that’s what’s really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just – the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven’t. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board. Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey guys, thanks for taking our question and nice results. Just curious on the service side, you had delays getting in and actually doing service, you talked about record number. I’m just kind of curious; sort of you mentioned earlier whether you actually are caught up or plan to catch up as you look into September? Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. and so we feel very good about that on the circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been – has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We’ve also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market.
So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we’re going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation – annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we’ll be in our target range and because of the scale that we’re now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we’re able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well.
So that’s – it’s a pretty good situation right now for service and I think we’ve adapted pretty well. And we’re trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that that are out there today, for us to position this business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward. Yes. I’ll just add to that. I mean, our service guys are really heroes, service guys and girls, this last quarter and this year, they’ve done an amazing job. When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we’re going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don’t want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it’s been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we’d set out pre-COVID for them. So, we feel really good about that. Thanks. I just want to ask on the recovery you’re targeting in memory, just kind of curious on the DRAM side; it was always going be late year. I was just curious if that’s part of any of the recovery you’re targeting? I think DRAMs a little bit, I think flash is better in the – as I said earlier, I think flash is better in the second half of the year, and that DRAM is probably stronger than the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that can move around a little bit, but that’s how we see it right now. Your next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Co. Your line is now open. Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Just wanted to come back to the China business, obviously, you haven’t seen a major impact from the commerce department actions. But wondering if you’ve seen any increased threat of de-Americanization of equipment in China, especially, from the domestic suppliers and probably more on the metrology side than the inspection side of your business, where I think you guys are pretty well entrenched? So Quinn, this is Rick, I think since KLA started doing business internationally, when I’ve been in the company back in Japan and whatever, the late 80s, there have always been attempts by our customers in different regions to have supply base. So, there’s never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that’s – the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we’re competitive, so that we’re more than competitive, we’re compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis.
And so you’ve got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that’s always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they’re going to do it. So, we don’t see that as particularly different than it’s been in the past. Thanks. And then quick follow-up for Bren, just a nice gross margin guidance in September. I’m wondering if there are any lingering COVID-19 costs that are still affecting that the gross margin possibly in the freight and logistics shipping would be one area. Yes. I don’t think it will – there are. And I don’t think it’ll change in the September quarter and probably, not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we’ll start to – we’ll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks. You talk about the setup is pretty good for next year for foundry and logic. Is it mostly driven by the five-nanometer ramble? Are you expecting any contribution from three-nanometer development? I know it’s still early, but maybe broadly speaking, do you have a view when you’re going to start seeing the revenue relate to three nanometers? Yes, both. For sure, we’ll see. I mean, as you know, these things go in cycles of the early – the early work and then you get the build-out and we also have some of the – as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of logic that’s a trailing that continues to be the investment. But on the leading edge, sure, we’ll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that’s really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space. Great. Then maybe, my follow-up to – a follow-up question. Historically, you see process control strength early in the process, and then at phase once the products are in volume production. Do you expect this pattern to continue or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward, given what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market? It really – it is true. I mean, that trend is true. It’s especially true when there’s fewer – there’s less innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you’ve got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to – so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there’s a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location.
So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn’t really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don’t have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past. Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Yes, sir. We have a question for Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just – there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which – it’s a more [indiscernible], which intuitively makes sense for the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI, special there’s 5G chips, chips going into different things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think about how that provides uplift for clack overall over the next few years? Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there’s one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don’t change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line.
So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What’s interesting about foundry is they don’t force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change.
The other thing that we’ve seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers – customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there’s so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that’s not what’s happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we’re really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that’s a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those. Does that make sense? Okay, Charlie. Yes, sir. We have no further question at this time, I will now turn the call back to the presenters. Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest. And this concludes the call and Charlie, please provide the final instructions. Thank you, sir.

We changed the format of these calls last quarter to include pre-publishing a shareholders letter that provide deeper insights into our business. We will also start by providing some streamlined highlights from our full prepared remarks, while still providing more time overall for your questions and answers.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thanks, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As we rapidly approach the end of the calendar year, it's amazing when I stopped to think how much has changed over the last 12 months. I hope you and your families are safe and in good health and I appreciate your continued interest in and support for our company.
I want to make sure I begin my remarks today by conveying my appreciation to the worldwide KLA team. It's your perseverance, strive to be better and determination that exemplify KLA's core values and enable us once again to meet our commitments and to deliver exceptionally strong financial performance in the September quarter. On behalf of the entire KLA executive team, I want to thank you.
In this quarter's Shareholder Letter that was published today, we highlighted how our results demonstrate the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As many of you may have already seen, our September quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS both finished at the upper end of our guidance, a result of continued strong demand from customers, exceptional execution by our global teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model in guiding our strategic objectives.
I'm pleased to say that, we are continuing this momentum into the December quarter and nearing the end of what truly has been an unprecedented year in calendar 2020. Most importantly, we are executing at a high level, operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and are solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets.
In terms of the resourcefulness of our global workforce, we just completed the third quarter of operating through a pandemic. COVID-19 has presented an unexpected opportunity to showcase KLA’s resilience and resourcefulness in these unprecedented times. We have begun proactively taking steps to mitigate disruption in our business and remain vigilant of the risk posed by the virus to our people. We've done this by adopting strict safety protocols to protect our workforce, while innovating new ways to collaborate with customers and partners. As demonstrated by our strong performance throughout 2020, we are successfully meeting customer needs, executing our R&D roadmap and operating our worldwide manufacturing facilities efficiently. We continue to evaluate and adapt at various facilities in accordance with local regulation, prioritizing employee health and safety.
Our worldwide teams deserve praise for never losing sight of what our customers want and need to improve their businesses, and to drive better yield management. We benefited from them being exceptionally resourceful and as always remain committed to customer satisfaction and meeting our commitments. While we consider the challenges our worldwide teams are facing today, we recognize that they extend well beyond the workplace, which makes us intently focused on ensuring that we're supporting our teams and our people in every possible way.
Lastly, investment in long term remains an important priority for us. We're confident that our R&D programs will help strengthen our technology and market leadership. And we’re gratified by the effectiveness of our business continuity actions, which have allowed R&D activities to adapt, although ,not without challenges, and to continue through this pandemic.
Now, turning to the industry demand environment. In the September quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control revenue was solidly above plan and our services business delivered strong operating leverage and is on track to deliver double digit growth in 2020. We also ended the quarter with strong backlog, reflecting the enabling role KLA plays in our customers’ technology roadmap and investment. Driven by the circular industry trends and the ongoing commitment by our customers to invest in R&D for next generation technology, the stage is set for KLA’s outdoor market in calendar 2020.
Today's environment continues to accelerate the adoption of several industry growth drivers that we originally outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. The integration of digital technology into our lives is transforming the way we live and work, resulting in fundamentally change to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This digital transformation is fueling secular demand drivers, such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and accelerated migration to the cloud from on-prem applications, as well as 5G communication, driving investments and innovation in advanced memory and logic device technologies.
Process control is on the critical path of enabling this digital transformation, driving our growth and long term revenue and profitability. And the addition of the Orbotech in 2019 to our business portfolio has expanded our exposure to the compelling industry trends. We’re all driving this all important digital transformation in our own business as well, including adopting new productivity tools to improve collaboration with our global teams and customers. For example, our customer service organization has been working closely with customers to expand remote service technologies, which augment our in country service and installation engineers. We’ve also recently adopted and integrated a new cloud based platform for managing our global HR management system that should continue to benefit us as we scale.
Finally, we're also integrating cloud based manufacturing and service planning tools to increase the visibility of our parts demand to our suppliers and to allow us to more proactively respond to customer service requirements. Here's just a few examples of the accelerated digital transformation that we ourselves are experiencing inside of KLA as we adapt to this new environment.
Here are five top highlights from our most recent quarter. First, as expected, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry and logic demand in the September quarter. These customers are benefiting from investment in digital transformation to support the secular growth drivers that we mentioned earlier. And we expect this demand to remain healthy in 2021. In memory, total utilization is high and memory customers continue to drive down device inventories and plan for higher bit growth in 2021 to meet expected improvement and then demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader range of customers in December quarter with momentum continuing into 2021.
Second, we ended the quarter with strong backlog, demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups, fueled by new applications in our optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen5 and the success of our new offerings, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform, we're seeing strong adoption of our patterned wafer inspection product suite, driving our market leadership and what we expect will be a year of growth for process control.
Third, our service business continues to perform well and is positioned for double digit growth in 2020. KLA's service revenue is 25% of the total quarterly and is delivering long term growth at a rate that's double the underlying industry WFE growth rate. Fourth, it was another strong quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components group, or EPC, highlighted by the record demand of our PCB division. The strong growth in PCB was driven by EPC's high exposure to the 5G infrastructure and smartphone market. SPTS and ICOS divisions are also benefiting from the transition to 5G along with increasingly the more complex advanced semiconductor packaging.
Finally, in keeping with our commitments to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, we announced back in July that our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase. During the September quarter, we returned $329 million to investors via dividends and buybacks. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before I hand it over to Bren to get into greater detail on our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges in the year associated with the pandemic, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of our global workforce. We have adapted well and we're very well positioned for a strong finish to 2020. This demonstrates the critical nature of our products and services in enabling the digital transformations of our lives, the resiliency of our business model and return value to our shareholders. We believe the secular factors driving our industry demand that we identified at last year's Investor Day are as relevant now as they were then, and they'll help us enable us to achieve our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long term operating leverage should yield consistent returns for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren. Thanks Rick and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's September quarter results once again demonstrated both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to exhibit our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining robust capital return strategy.
Total revenue was $1.54 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03 at the high end of the guided range of $2.42 to $3.06. GAAP EPS was $2.69. Gross margin at 62.1% was 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, as higher semiconductor process control product mix, lower inventory reserve requirements due to strengthening demand and services leveraged, drove the upside realized in the quarter.
Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.27 billion. In terms of approximate customer segment mix of process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers, foundry was strong as expected at 59%, logic was 10% and memory was 31% in the September quarter. Within memory, the business was split roughly two thirds DRAM and one third NAND. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $89 million, down 11% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. Demand in this segment is driven by growth in RF, MEMs and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $181 million, down 10% sequentially but up 1% year-over-year.
In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.04 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.45 billion after retiring $50 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $456 million in the September quarter, free cash flow conversion was 96.1% and free cash flow margin was 29.7%. For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow, including $542 million in dividends paid and $789 million in share repurchases.
During the September quarter, we repurchased $188 million of common stock and paid $141 million in dividends. As it relates to guidance, our view for WFE growth this year is approximately 10%, growing off a baseline of $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019. Given this and our outlook for revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter, KLA is in position once again to outgrow our industry. Looking forward, no early based on our current backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the first half of calendar '21. We will have more to say about our views of '21 WFE in our January earnings report.
Before turning to our specific December quarter guidance, we'd like to comment on the current trade situation regarding United States and China. As you all know, in the September quarter, the US Department of Commerce stated that SMIC, or SMIC, may pose an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end-use in China. So we must obtain an export license prior to shipping certain systems and spare parts to SMIC and certain related parties that are subject to the US export administration regulations.
This new license requirement did not have any effect on any shipments in the September quarter. We are complying with the new rules and have already applied for licenses for expected shipments in the December quarter. Given the expected level of business in the quarter subject to license requirements, the result of the license requirements will not have a material impact on revenue. And as a result, we have made no adjustments for this situation to our plans or guidance ranges. The trade situation remains fluid and we've done our best to give you our perspective on the impact to our business and we’ll refrain from speculating on the situation further.
Our December quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.585 billion plus or minus $75 million; Foundry is forecasted to be about 52% of semiconductor process control systems revenues for semiconductor customers, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst the foundry customer base; Memory is expected to grow to be approximately 37%: Logic is expected to be about 11%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as we expect similar product mix and services leverage as in the September quarter.
The market reception to product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong. And as outlined at our Investor Day last year, the company has made solid progress in our plans at driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. In addition, better than modeled gross margin improvement in acquired businesses is a tailwind to our gross margins overall. Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest in other expenses of approximately $42 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.59 to $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.82 to $3.46, or $3.14 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, KLA is executing well with increasing confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and profitability. Growth in semiconductor revenue looks compelling over the long run with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes.
We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fill our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, I think we're ready for you to queue for questions, please provide instructions. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Congratulations I just wanted to follow-up, Bren, on your commentary around China. You said the results of licenses will not have a material impact on the December quarter revenue. Is that because you've already adjusted for it in your guidance or you just don't think that most of your shipments to SMIC require a license? And in that same vein, just given that China continues to be extremely strong, I think one of the key investor concerns out there is that the fear of bands are causing customers to pull forward. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the mix of your China business between domestic and multinational and kind of that concern of pull forward? So on the SMIC situation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've applied for licenses for the December quarter where we think we need them. And if you look at just overall, I mean, SMIC, just for some background, it's an important customer but not a particularly large one. And over the last six months or so we've been discussing a broadening of investment. And certainly, they participated in that.
There's probably timing factors that are involved in terms of how others are seeing this business come in over the course over the year. But as we look at what we revenued in the September quarter and where there was no effect and then we look at the December quarter, we've applied for licenses, as I said, where we need them. And at the end of the day, when we look at the overall expectation of revenue on our business for the quarter, we just don't see it having a material impact. So we didn't have to adjust anything, frankly. So our plans are consistent overall. So there's no change there.
On your second question really difficult in our business. I mean, certainly, demand overall has been very strong. And so when you have a customer try to pull in a delivery, it means that they're taking a slot from another customer. And given the overall demand profile, that is -- most of the customers are sticking with their slots. So we haven't really seen a change. We've been, I think, fairly consistent in our view of shipments for the year of about $800 million. It's been second half loaded. It's what we are seeing today. So I haven't seen much of a change overall in terms of the behavior for customers, at least in regards to our products. And we will take our next question today from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. On the innovation and new product front, there's a good correlation in years where the team rolls out new tools and platforms and then the forward revenue momentum for the next few years. Last year, you guys I think launched about 10 new tools or platforms, second iteration of your Gen5, your new X-ray metrology platform, e-beam inspection platform and also your multi column e-beam inspection for mask inspection, just to kind of name a few. Are these platforms contributing to the incremental upside in revenue performance this year? And how many new platforms do you guys have in development and/or will be introducing over the next 12 months? As you might imagine, these programs are at different points in their life cycle. So yes, we have seen contribution. For example, we talked about print check for EUV with the BBP platform, and that's been a continuation and a broadening of that demand. In other cases, we've talked recently about where we are in terms of the X-ray metrology product or the multi-beam reticle tool. Those are not contributing in a material way to the revenue in the near term, but those are products that we do expect to fuel our growth in '21 and beyond in support of the 2023 plan.
In terms of how many programs we have under development, we have a number as always of significant investments going on. But as you might imagine, there are various phases of introduction. But when we laid out our 2023 plan, we're pretty confident that the programs that we've got in place and the ones that are under development are where they need to be in order to support the 2023 plan. The challenges of some of those, as you might imagine, there have been some COVID challenges, which maybe hit us harder early in COVID. And then we -- in terms of program execution. But we feel like we've made great progress in terms of navigating that. And we feel good about where we are, which is why we say we're on track to meet or exceed the '23 plans that we laid on. Bren, do you want to add to that? Harlan, I think one of the things that we're pretty excited about is that over the last year or so, we've introduced platforms in a lot of our core businesses. And those platforms have had really strong market perception. We think you mentioned Gen 5, but also new iterations of the Gen 4 product line and customers mix and matching across both tool sets and supporting a wide variety of designs and different process flows, which has been great for the business. But new laser scattering offerings, you mentioned e-beam, we have a new e-beam inspection product. And the portfolio strategy of the company, as we connect those tools and we leverage common interfaces and common algos, common software, it's been able to, I think, provide a pretty competitive offering out there in the marketplace.
And so we've been able to maintain our share. We grew share in 2019. We think we're going to maintain that in '20, maybe improve it a little bit and been able to do it at very strong margins. So certainly, growth in the overall business is a factor there but also the product position is a factor. So we're pretty pleased with what's out in the marketplace. And to Rick's point, we've got some new things coming down the pipe that hopefully will drive our performance against our '23 targets. We will go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. I guess, I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit about the confidence that you have on sustainable spending in the first half of '21. And in particular, I would love to hear your thoughts around foundry and logic contributions. And as part of that, if you could touch on what impact if at all you might see if we see greater spend on 5-nanometer versus 3-nanometer at TSMC? Thank you. As we said in the prepared remarks, we had very strong backlog coming into the quarter. We had a positive book to bill this quarter. And if we look at the funnel of expectations into the December quarter, just the overall order outlook as we look into December and into March and then the backlog position we believe will take into the year, gives us some confidence of sustainability of these business levels. And so while it's early for us to spend a lot of time sizing '21, and we'll have more to say about ‘21 in the next earnings call in January, that overall position gives us confidence that we'll see some sustainability here.
From a foundry/logic point of view when you look at the overall market, and there are puts and takes there. But we are pretty confident in the fact that foundry/logic looks like that it has sustainability as we move into the first half of the year, I don't see it changing. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter there's always fluctuation. But in general feel very good about the profile of that business as we move in the first half. And just one thing to add, C.J. I think one of the beliefs and our investment thesis on some of our new capabilities, for example, EUV print check, was that we were going to be highly relevant in the advanced nodes. But of course, people really hadn't hit much volume. So we've really seen proof of that concept. And we're getting a lot of customer pull for capacity and capability to support those ramps, and it's not just at one customer. So we feel very good about the process control intensity expectations that we had going into these nodes. We're seeing them being realized. So we view that as another positive indicator, not just on the overall foundry spend but on the process control related spend. We would expect Gen 5 to have some growth next year in wafer starts and we also expect to see some, what we call mini line risk production type investment on N3 more towards the middle of the year end, into the second half. Thank you. And we will move to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. I had a question for Rick or Bren. You guys mentioned in your prepared comments memory should see growth next year. I understand you're going to give more color in January. But just within that context, how would you expect KLA revenues to trend? The reason I'm asking is there's a general view that within the memory vertical, KLA has more exposure to NAND than DRAM. So I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on '21 memory and KLA's performance. Really, since the middle of 2018 or so, we've seen very disciplined spending by our memory customers. And so we've seen that continue through after a strong down year in 2019 to a flattish year here in 2020. We see some modest recovery here in the December quarter as you see from the disclosures we gave for the quarter. And we see that continuing as we move into next year. I don't see -- just if you look at the overall pricing environment and certainly the smartphone and timing of data center recovery, we'll have an impact on the overall memory environment.
You've got EUV introduction into DRAM, which could be a factor as well as we move into the second half of the year that we would expect to see memory as an improving business for us as we move into '21. As I said, I think that the discipline has been there. And as we start to see pricing recover, I think you'll see more investment there. But I wouldn't say it's a huge expectation in terms of growth but I think a lot of it will be dependent on some of the end market dynamics that I mentioned.
From a process control intensity point of view, it's a little bit higher today in 3D flash than DRAM, although the introduction of EUV and DRAM is an opportunity for us to drive process control intensity. So I think we're optimistic about that when we start to see that play out. And then also as stacks, layer counts increase in flash that we will see more opportunities for our metrology product lines. We've got some new product offerings. We also have the e-beam inspection tools. We talked about where things that we believe will ultimately create some opportunities for us for either intensity improvement or share. So I think we're pretty optimistic about those opportunities. And we will move next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Sorry to go back to this, but I just want to make sure I understand the SMIC situation. Are you saying you didn't have exposure in the September quarter? And then, I guess, as you look at these rules, is there sort of an equal impact whether you ship out of the US or whether you ship out of Israel or Singapore? In the September quarter, the change or the notification from the government came in at the very end of September. So there's no impact in the September quarter. And so as we look at the December quarter, as I said earlier, when we have to apply for licenses, we've applied for those. And we don't think that the granting of those licenses within the time frame we're talking about or not, will have a material impact on the business. And is there a difference as to where you ship out of it? Is it a different licensing process, whether you ship out of the US or from a foreign location? Well, the licensing requirement is -- there isn't a licensing requirement that comes from a factor. And we will go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Rick or Bren, in terms of your PCB business, it's actually had a few strong quarters and you mentioned that 5G has been a big driver. You've given us the road map and a lot of the development on the process control area. Can you just talk about, I guess, the product road map on that business and because these type of tools typically have a long lifespan. When do you feel the need to call refresh and upgrade it for this next wave of line that's being driven by 5G? It's a great question. And the answer is, we're relatively new to this business. So about year and half year, very impressed with what the Orbotech team had been doing. And I think in conjunction with them, we're really working hard to make sure we have the right amount of investment to continue new products meeting customer needs. And I would say that they had great engagement and we've added that. And as a result, we're investing heavily in that business to make sure that we're meeting some of the emerging demand, the flex PCB and all the new substrates, all the things. This is the beginning, as you know, of the 5G. And we think there's a continued opportunity for system growth over time. So we're very bullish on what that team has done. And in combination, we think it's been a tremendous success so far and a lot of upside as we go forward. But like KLA businesses, it requires continued investment in new capabilities and we're doing that right now. And we will move next to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Bren, I had a question about your Semi Systems business. If I sort of take your prior comments about the PCB and the Display business for calendar half-on-half, you said it would be down half-on-half. So that would imply that, that segment is sort of at best flat for December. And that's the biggest piece other than Semi Systems. So it seems like Semi Systems have to be up about 5% to like 9.35 to 9.40 for December? So I guess, A, is that right? And B, assuming it is, then your systems for the year are up about 10%, which is about in line with where we think WFE is? Yet you said that you're outgrowing the market. So I just wanted to see if you can fit those comments. Because it doesn't seem like you're really gaining WFE share this year, and you didn't gain anything last year either in a period where we've seen pretty big mix shifts toward foundry/logic. So I guess, can you sort of speak to that? Thanks. A few questions in there, Tim, and I'll try to answer this for you. Yes, I mean your conclusion around December sequential Semi Systems is right, mid single digits. Obviously, we run the business at a total company level. But in terms of our expectations, it looks like it's sequentially a bit single digit growth here. And so when you take in aggregate, you add all that up that with our semi systems, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15% growth year-over-year against a market environment that's 10%. So that's an outperform. And if you look at last year, WFE was down about 7% and our Semi business was up 1%. So that's an outperform too in 2019. So we can spend some time with you on the math on all of this, but that's how to think about your questions. Thank you. We will go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Rick, if I look at inspection and measurement, industry sales attach rate to lithography sales historically, it makes a new high as industry introduces newer wave length. As you look at EUV now since introduction at 7-nanometer growing to 26 steps at 3-nanometer and some introduction at DRAM. Do you think the defect challenges associated with EUV remains a tailwind for your process control business or leveling off? I think it's a good question. What we've seen so far, as you know, we're relatively conservative, but we have had indications and we believe earlier in EUV that we would see increased penetration of our advanced optical tools as well as in the mass shop. That's really playing out. So we do model process control intensity going up as a result of increased EUV adoption. And part of why that's working for us is, I mentioned EUV print check. That's essentially kind of a new category where we're able to deploy additional BBP tools to support the RAM of EUV. And as you might imagine, those wafers are incredibly expensive. So there's a a real focus by our customers to make sure that they're obviously optimizing their yield and catching excursions.
At the same time, the size of the defect is becoming more relevant and smaller defects. So our tools end up having to run in modes where they capture smaller defects with increased algorithms, which also means that the capacity needs increase as the design rules go down in order to cover and detect. So yes, I would say that those are both tailwinds and our customers tell us that because they're very ambitious about ramping the advanced nodes and wanting to make sure we're in a position to support them. Does that answer your question? We will go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. I wanted to first ask just the patterning business, up 21% sequentially. It looks like it had a pretty strong quarter. Wondering if you could highlight sort of what areas within pattern and really drove that growth? And then I've got a follow-up. Patterning overall, we had a strong quarter in reticle inspection. So quarter to quarter, that was the biggest driver. Do you expect that to continue or is that a fairly lumpy business? Well, it's big ASPs. And so it's low integers and big ASPs. And so depending on timing, it does tend to be lumpy. Overall reticle inspection, because of the number of design starts in advanced foundry has been a really strong business for us. So I think that when we look at it overall, it was a very strong year in '19 and '20. It’s down a little bit from '19 in that business but still pretty strong. So I think those drivers will continue. And as we move into next year and we start to move into some of our offerings to support additional EUV activities, we should see some contribution from there as well. But reticle inspection was a driver. But to your point, it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Follow-up question, just ASML, in call you talked about some modulation in its EUV system deliveries given no transition timing of some of its customers. Wondering if you look into next year, do you see continued growth in EUV print check, or do you expect that to perhaps soften for some period of time? I wouldn't say softened. I mean the challenge that customers have with EUV print check is into new application, there are new algorithms. There’s new defects that they've got to run down and do source. And so there's a huge appetite to get that. In fact, we're getting a lot of pressure to get systems that were forecast delivered to support that. And there are additional algorithms, as I said, we're developing. So all the indications we see are an expanding opportunity for EUV print check and I think that will go for some time based on the early indications that we're getting. We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. I wanted to dig into the gross margins and your operating margins, both were above your longer-term planned for September. And I believe the midpoint of your guidance says that they can sustain at these levels. I'm curious, how should we think about the trajectory of these margins going into the next several quarters? Can they sustain at these levels or do you think that there was anything abnormal, whether it was COVID or mix related that helped you? And as kind of part B of that, it was good to see you restart the share buybacks, but the levels are still somewhat below, I think what you have done in some prior quarter. So any color around just the sustainability of margins and how you can reaccelerate share repurchase would be very helpful. Thank you. On gross margin, as I said earlier, we've been very pleased overall with the product positioning overall and the pricing related to that positioning. So that's been a good thing for our business. I mentioned operating leverage in Service. And so with the growth of the Service business, the utilization rates in the installed base that one thing with consolidation in the industry allows you to really drive good utilization across your resources. And we've invested in a lot of infrastructure over the last few years and we're starting to see the benefits of that now.
We are getting the tailwind too in our EPC group related to acquisitions that the acquired businesses are doing better from a margin point of view. So there's a number of factors that are driving. If you look at our long term plan, we talked about 60% to 61% at these revenue level type gross margin performance. And I would expect us now to be somewhere between 61% and 62%. You do have mix factors in any given quarter. But I do think there's probably a good point here of sustainability versus the model that we had.
If you take it down to operating margins, I think we're underspending our normalized spend levels just because of some of the COVID constraints around travel, but also how quickly we can hire people and so on. So I do think that the spend level is probably understated a bit when compare it to what normalized would look like. But I do think that there is a point here that drops through that has sustainability to it. Mix issues notwithstanding in any given quarter.
On the buyback, as we back up and just look at it, we start with a principle in terms of how we look at the overall capital structure of the company and then how we allocate the capital. And so we start with a cash target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're operating within our target range today. And so most of our buybacks or returns generally are funded through ongoing cash flow. So it was a little bit lower in this quarter compared to the March quarter, I guess. I can't recall exactly where that number was, I think March and December. But I think as you look at that and we look at our go-forward expectations around cash flow, we would expect it will be roughly around these levels on an ongoing basis. So somewhere, it was $188 million, I'd say somewhere around $200 million plus or minus. And it's a systematic approach because, again, it starts with sort of a process that we run through.
So we have some opportunistic possibility around that, that we can work around it. But at the same time, it tends to be much more principle based than anything else. So I think that's how you'll see it play out. At the end of the day, we're going to return at least 70%. We returned 82% in the last 12 months. And we're going to return at least 70% of the cash flow we're going to generate through the share repurchases and dividends and pretty balanced across the two. [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open. I just want to revisit prior question on memory. You mentioned in your letter, customers were looking for higher big growth to meet demand. Just any more color where that demand is coming from? And I know you don't want to guide for memory next year, but just any color on what type of magnitude outside you're seeing? Well, like I said, we're optimistic. We see some improvement in the December quarter, and I think that continues as we move into next year. So most of it coming from customers supporting 5G and handsets, we think that's probably the biggest driver. But it's pretty modest growth at these levels just given where the industry has been, but we're optimistic that we'll see growth as we move into next year. And I'm showing that we have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Kevin Kessel for any closing or additional remarks. Thank you very much, Priscilla, and thank you, everybody, for your questions and your interest. We will be talking to you shortly during the quarter during our virtual investor event. This concludes the call. This concludes today's KLA first quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants’ lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. And welcome to KLA’s Fiscal Q2 2021 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the December Quarter and our Outlook for the March Quarter. With me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.
During today’s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending December 31, 2020, that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck. All are available on the KLA IR section of our website.
Today’s discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today’s earnings materials posted on our website.
Today’s call also represents the end of the calendar year. We will make references to both 2020 and 2021. Please note all references are for the calendar year. Our IR website also contains future virtual investor conferences, as well as presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
As many of you now know, we changed the format of our earnings two quarters ago to include pre-publishing a detailed shareholder letter that provides updates on our business performance. The pre-publishing allows this call to be efficient by providing more streamlined comments while also freeing up more time for your questions and answers.
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA. As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it’s important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team.
Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen and while our teams have not been physically together for the most part; our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever.
In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA’s record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow, while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remained focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong returns to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market.
Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I’d like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth.
We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
In the December quarter, we saw a diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging, and Components group met its target and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage.
We ended the year with strong backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We are operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers’ technology roadmaps and enhancing their return on capital investment.
Moving to today’s demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several Semiconductor and Electronics industry growth drivers that we have been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value.
This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics, and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation in advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices, as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies.
With our market leadership in process control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB, and finished die inspection in our EPC Group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world.
As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that’s remained a constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives.
We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives.
Let’s turn now to five top highlights for our -- in our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw a continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand.
We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA’s essential role in supporting our customers’ drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes.
Second, we are seeing strong momentum in the marketplace from new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC Groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment and EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio such as EUV print check for GEN5 and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of X-ray technologies for metrology applications.
Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our install base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC Group.
The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID.
Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet and we have seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generates strong operating leverage and cash flows.
Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC Group, demonstrating success and KLA’s growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses.
Revenue growth was strong and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio, and addressing fast growing new markets in the Electronics value chain such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display.
Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the Electronics value chain as well. The EPC Group ended the year with record backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model.
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends.
Back in July, KLA’s Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned to $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow.
Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we have adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength, while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth.
KLA is exceptionally well-positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The Semiconductor and Electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest, which was being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge.
We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
And with that, I will pass the call over to Bren. Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. KLA’s December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.
2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders.
Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, a very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 billion to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%.
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, probably, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27.
Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations.
The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs, as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs.
Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given topline expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage.
Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States and we will provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future.
Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%.
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC Group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment including its associated Service business was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020.
Approximate customer segment mix is as follows; foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM.
Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether our customers in one category or another given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry-reporting practices.
Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging.
PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020, as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business.
In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies.
From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA return $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million and share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
As it relates to guidance as we begin the New Year, our view is that the fab -- wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion.
2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth.
Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year.
Our March quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million; foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of semi process control systems’ revenue; memory is expected to be approximately 32%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25%, as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume will lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021.
Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $155 million shares.
In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA.
KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guide our strategic objectives.
These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, if you could provide the instructions for Q&A? [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Thank you very much and a belated Happy New Year and congrats to you guys. Rick, maybe first off, in terms of process control intensity, we have seen foundry and logic continue to grow as we go through these node migrations. And NAND flash has obviously seen intensity rise with the increasing layer counts. As we look at DRAM and the projected pickup that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what types of process control intensity increases are you seeing in that marketplace? Maybe even excluding some of the EUV options that are out there, what other types of process control intensity trends are increasing in DRAM? Sure. I think that there -- if you think about DRAM, what they have really been pushing on and it’s very difficult as you know to do it is to continue scaling and we do think that there is going to be some EUV that comes in. But there is no question that there is scaling happening, and of course, that drives more process control intensity.
The other thing that’s pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we are seeing increased -- trying to understand how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they have got.
And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there will be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that’s what we are seeing as a trend. It’s not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we would see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick? Hey. It does, Rick. Thank you. Bren, as a follow-up to that question, you guys as you are seeing demand pickup and revenues grow, your working capital metrics have actually also improved. What changes have you made, particularly given that you have added Orbotech over the last few years, but you see the inventory turns actually improving even as demand picks up. What are some of the dynamics there? Well, hey, Patrick. It’s a great question. And certainly adding Orbotech in and I think we have done a pretty good job of improving overall asset velocity in that business so far. I think there is room for us to improve it going forward.
But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model. Both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products but also that enables our service business.
So we have always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we are supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships and a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said protect differentiation.
So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments and we carry that risk, if you will. Although, we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength of the Service business we tend to move the part.
So we think it’s a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. And the volume we have seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It’s -- this is not a turns business for the most part. So I think there’s probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on and I think we have improved it a little bit over time. Thank you very much. We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to your comment about revenues should be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2021. Is that a process control tool comment as well, I guess what I am trying to understand is, what you are seeing relative to maybe peers talking about WFE being a little bit more first half weighted? Yeah. Joe, so it’s a good question. So what we are trying to do, first of all, it’s really for both groups of our business, if you look at the EPC Group and as well as the process control equipment part of the business.
I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we are guiding March and we have got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for ‘21 and expectations for KLA in the year.
And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I am not guiding the June quarter, I am not guiding September, I am not guiding December, but what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context.
Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment, the customer acceptance, the consignment buyout and so on.
But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view, and I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement. Okay. That’s helpful. And then you talked about the other investments you are making on the product development side, and clearly, you guys are strongly outperforming your long-term profitability targets. I was curious, how do you think about opportunities to maybe even spend a little bit more and accelerate some of the product development projects you have got going on? Sounds like you have been talking to some of our guys inside it. Sometimes Rick and I are the only two people in the company, I think, we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio.
So we have ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that’s driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at ‘21 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on.
So I think that that’s been an area of focus for us. But we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements and it’s worked pretty well for KLA.
I think what’s driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic. And so, I think, the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we are adding to our customers. So hopefully that answers your question. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess two questions if I could put them together. The first one would be around EUV shortages at ASML, is that impacting GEN5 optical demand at all? And then, I guess, secondly, I am a little bit surprised that you are guiding Orbotech business is flat half-on-half, typically there is a seasonal uplift into the back half. I am curious if that’s a conservative outlook, whether seasonality has changed or there is something that we should be kind of thinking about? Thank you. Yeah. CJ, nicely done, those are not related at all, those two questions, as you know. But I will take them. The first one, no, we don’t see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5, if anything, it’s kind of gone the other way.
What’s happened in the last few months is, I think, the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with the EUV are best approach -- best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity and so we are actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5, we don’t see any delay in that and we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that.
In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, I would say, it’s a complicated business overall to aggregate and so we don’t really see anything, any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlaid at the Investor Day and we are on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it.
We will have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand just the dynamics of the Orbotech business. But we feel good about the signs that we are seeing, and as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year. So, CJ, the only thing that I will add to that is we were guiding it right. This still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter as is -- at a different obviously order of magnitude than our Semiconductor Process Control equipment business.
But if you look at what’s driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within specialty, and then just all -- the overall PCB dynamics and how it’s changing relative to integration and packaging and high performance computing. It’s all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses.
So while the display business is, I expect a down year in ‘21 versus ‘20, the other businesses are more than making up for it. So I think that, overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year. Great. Thank you. We will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for letting me ask the question. First one is for Bren. Bren, I am wondering if you just give a little bit more detail around what happened to mix in the December quarter that drill gross margins a little bit light relative to revenues being at the high end of the range and as we look out beyond March, are there any other mix considerations we should think about as we think about gross margins? Yeah. John, it’s the usual quarter-to-quarter variability. So it was a little bit weaker in the December quarter and you see a bit of a bounce back into the March quarter. So we were 20 basis points below and we just guided 25 basis points over the midpoint or over that 62%.
And as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we are operating in the 61.5% to 62% range. So it was really just a function of the products that actually revenue in the quarter. It’s a customer acceptance timing dynamic and not any other reason. Yeah. That’s helpful. And then, Rick, as my follow up, maybe I will go back to the memory question that Patrick asked first, but ask it a little bit differently. If we are doing the math right, December quarter memory was a new record. You have to go back to kind of June of 2018 to see memory this high, and as you know, we in the investment community always think about that space is being kind of hyper-cyclical. We are willing to underwrite some of the structural drivers in logic and foundry, maybe not as much in memory. When you look at the level of memory business today, how do you kind of parse out where we are in the quote-unquote CapEx cycle for memory versus some of the structural drivers you outlined in Patrick’s answer? Yeah. John, I think, as you know, since we are a little more dependent on technology transition than we are at volume, our answer is a little different, because it has more to do with the migration and the yield challenges associated with advanced nodes and what we see there is a pretty steady commitment toward additional capability to drive next-generation and we are seeing that for multiple players.
So I think like a lot of things in this industry KLA’s exposure is -- there is less variability in it based on that fact. And so the volume considerations associated with CapEx impact us less than that. And maybe Bren can give some color on how that looks for the -- as we go through the year. Well, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020 and we saw this increase in the December quarter, which had some breath to it and we expected to see that, so we weren’t surprised by it and then as we look at ‘21, we expect to see growth overall.
We articulated our view earlier about just -- we think the DRAM market overall probably grows at a higher percentage level than in the flash market, but we would expect to see growth in the business into ‘21.
But it’s been pretty disciplined. So seen it bounce back in the December quarter and some sustainability here at these levels as we move through the first part, at least here of ‘21, it’s encouraging. Thank you. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them to Rick. Just to follow along the thought process on memory, it seems like KLA the way it is today is relatively more exposed to NAND than DRAM. Do you think that exposure or process control intensity increases in DRAM as DRAM goes more EUV? And if so, how should we think about KLA’s revenue mix and then I had a follow-up. Yeah. I mean, I think, that the differences are pretty slight, in terms of what the drivers are. It’s actually different products that are getting impacted. So if you think about DRAM, we are more -- obviously scaling is more of a factor there and so you will see more of what we are doing in terms of whether it’s GEN5.
You don’t really see that and what’s going on in NAND, but you do have some of the new products, we talked about the X-ray technology is really more applicable of that, some of the challenges associated with metrology.
And even how it impacts our wafer business or Surfscan business, because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality that those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield. So they are different, I think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they are both kind of increasing at similar amounts. Got it. Got it. Krish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is, with the introduction of EUV and want to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure. Now that’s one level of investment and is that sustainable over time is I think a challenge for our teams. But as customers start to deploy EUV, it will require EUV related infrastructure to help manage that. So that’s a factor that’s out there that also a -- maybe a change moving forward. Fair enough, Bren. And then another follow up for you on Services. In the shareholder letter, you spoke about how the Services attach rate grew from 70% to over 75% through the course of last year. I am just curious how high can it realistically get or put it another way, Service is running at 25% of total sales, can it get to over 30%? Thank you. Well, Krish, it will. It’s two separate questions. It will because it’s growing faster than the underlying systems business. If you look at our service model, it’s a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day and I’d argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we have seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward.
There is clearly customers are valuing the service offerings particularly as you are seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and that with the need for those customers to keep those tools up.
A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing increasing reliability requirements and that’s driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us.
So I keep thinking -- look 80%, 85%, I think, that’s probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There is always dynamics of certain customers that prefer billable model and so we will have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure.
At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through cycle profitability. So that’s what we aspire to.
So I think there’s opportunities but I think there’s always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers will prefers a total structure in parts of their installed base. Just to add to that, I mean, one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it’s pretty much service your own car today, 15 years ago it might have been different.
And so you think about over time, the complexity in the associative, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system and it just becomes more economical to rely on us.
And then there is no question that a service model -- a customer benefits from having a contract over the long-term. They take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime.
So I agree with, Bren, I think it goes up over time. But nothing moves particularly fast in the Services world given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we are firmly convinced and committed to driving it. Very helpful. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren. Thank you. We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First is, if I take your March quarter outlook and annualize it, it suggests this calendar year growth in line with WFE growth. But when I look at some of the investments that are being made and 5-nanometer and then 3-nanometer on the foundry side and then the DRAM, which is more kind of logic like. I am curious what are the prospects of outgrowing WFE? I guess it’s the process control intensity question just asked in a different way, like, what would help you grow above or below WFE this year? So when I look at it, Vivek, I think, that there is -- we have a little bit more memory investment this year than in ‘20 and so that puts downward pressure on process control intensity. But you are right about the opportunities in foundry/logic and some of the product offerings that we expect to have over the course of 2021.
So when I look at it and I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we will probably do a little bit better. There’s some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at ‘21. But overall, I think that that’s where process control intensity kind of plays out.
And then from a share if we execute, I think, there’s probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I do think KLA’s share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at ‘21 from where we sit today. Got it. And a follow up is a question on cash returns to shareholders, your profitability is very analog semi like, right, almost 37%, 38% operating margins, but free cash flow returns are -- do leave a lot more room for improvement, even when I look at the buybacks that you had in December, they were somewhat lower than the average we have seen in the last two years. So I am curious, how are you looking at cash returns going forward, if you are going to have such strong growth this year and the longer term trends are there, why not look at 100% free cash flow returns and looking at boosting dividends or the buyback? Well, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think, even over time it, every time we get the question, we have been very explicit about how we think about the -- about capital allocation in the company and our belief that generally cash doesn’t get valued unless it’s deployed productively.
And so when you look at what we are doing going forward, we expect that, at a minimum, we would be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We were right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit.
But you are right, given the growth of the business I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it and we are operating at that level today and so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. I think we have done a pretty good job with that.
But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor, and given the uptick in the business that we are describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here.
Now, on the dividend side, A, we have raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in, year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years.
We are going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that’s our model and we will -- we do our exercise here and each year and we will continue to do it that way, I don’t think anything’s changed. Great. Thank you. We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on China. I think China was -- if my math is right, the Chinese revenue was down about 20% quarter-over-quarter after pretty good third quarter but still up very solidly for the year by 20%. What are your expectations for your opportunity in China this year? So, I would expect WFE in China to be flat to up. I am looking at our business levels and they match that. So it -- I would say, it’s very consistent with the profile of 20%, maybe a little bit better and it’s different customers... Okay. …that are investing. But in general, that’s how we see it. Okay. Great. Maybe my follow-up question is related to your target model. You printed operating margin 38%, guiding up to 39% plus, well ahead of your target model and it sounds like you are comfortable with that, you will continue to exceed that. But are there things that we should be aware of that may bring down operating margin as your revenue continue to grow either in next few years in terms of either cost of goods sold side of things, gross margin obviously, offerings expenses side, then we try to normalize a little bit over the next few years? Thanks. Well, there is always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. But when you look at our long-term plan of growing our top line at least in the 7% to 9% range and dropping 1.5 times that revenue growth rate in terms of EPS growth. But that drives effectively an incremental operating margin that’s between 40% and 50% and that’s how we are going to run the company over time.
So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- your gross margin, whether it’s a product mix, obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model we put out there.
So, yes, we are outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we have seen in the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business.
And I think that a lot of, as I said earlier and said in the prepared remarks, a lot of its sustainable. So that’s our model and we are outperforming it and expect to over the next number of quarters as I outlined. Great. Thank you. We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Bren, I am sorry, you might have already talked about this, but I actually jumped on late. So it seems like if you are going to hold WFE share pretty flat, which I think is pretty reasonable in the 6.3% or 6.4% range. It seems like process control shipments are going to be or revenue is going to be in the 1.05% range for March and then it’s going to sort of stay in that range throughout the rest of the year. So you are not going to see this pronounced half-on-half decline that maybe some others will. Is that sort of the right way to think about the semis process piece? So, Tim, yeah, you missed it. I covered it earlier and there were some prepared remarks that I had that were about a sustained or a consistent demand profile over the next number of quarters. So that isn’t guidance but that was just to give some context on how we see the year shaping up.
Notwithstanding the issue that we have around, just general ASPs of our tools that can cause some variability quarter-to-quarter. If you look at the March quarter, and again, we run the -- we guide one revenue number, but my expectations around the semi process control business are somewhere between 1.435% and 1.455% including Service, somewhere in that ballpark. Including service. Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks. Yeah. And then, I had a question on NAND, so I know you don’t have a ton of visibility there. But your commentary that NAND is going to be sort of the weakest in terms of the relative end markets on a year-over-year basis this year is kind of interesting. I think some others are beginning to try to say the same thing, it sounds like about flat as the growing consensus. There was a pretty big budget flush from one of the big customers in the fourth quarter, so that was higher. But I guess my question is, is your view on NAND is it, because things have been cut, so because the procurement has been cut later on in the year as to why it’s flat or is it because the number’s the same, it’s just as off of the bigger base in 2020? Thanks. Yeah. I think there is some growth in NAND. It’s the lowest percentage growth rate of the three segments that we articulated. So I think it’s probably a mid-single-digit type growth rate and that’s obviously off a bigger base as we look at ‘21. But it’s not because things have been cut, Bren, that’s what I guess. No. Okay. I am not so sure I understand the question. But I think it’s been fairly consistent I think here. I think it upticked a little bit in the second half to your point and I think that there is some growth next year off of ‘20. Cool. Okay. Thanks so much. We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In 2019 in Semiconductor Process Control, you guys gained about 300 basis points of share on the systems side. Revenue-wise you were about 5 times larger than your nearest competitor. It looks like your process control systems business grew about 17% in 2020. Do you guys think you sustained or gained overall process control market share in 2020 and then what areas do you think you drove the most share gains, then on your view of double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2021, what are going to be the fastest growing segments within process control? Harlan, I think, it kind of -- there’s kind of two ways to answer it. What were the end drivers for it and what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn’t necessarily the only thing BBP is used for.
So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We will see what the final numbers come out. But you remember, Investor Day we are modeling a slower growth in share than what we are actually seeing. So we feel really good about... Right. …where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar ‘20. As you shift to ‘21, we feel like we are well-positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had.
Again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable and we feel good about how we are positioned there.
So I think that you are right, we gained more in ‘19 than in 2020. We held our gains may be built on it a little and I think we are positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our ‘23 plan but, certainly, for ‘21. That’s the way the year’s lining up. That’s we are build plans look right now. Yeah. The product families overall… Yeah. Thanks. …all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma in the strength there. Because of the memory uptick we are seeing and after a couple of years now of digesting, we are seeing more patterned inspection or unpatterned inspection investment and so that’s a good indicator both to support the wafer output, but also which memory tends to drive wafer so that drives that business.
And then the tool monitoring that is done with un-patterned inspectors for any monitor wafers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well. Great. Thanks for the insight there. And on the EPC side, I spot very good diversification to the business. Going back to the 2019 Analyst Day, the team’s outlook for EPC was kind of like a 9% to 10% CAGR, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in revenues in 2023. Based on the results that you put up in 2020, looks like you guys grew that business about 10%, 11%, if you included the full quarter of Orbotech in your March 2019 quarter. So we can see the team tracking to or slightly ahead of those targets. What sort of growth are you guys expecting for EPC this year, would it be more in line with that 9% to 10% CAGR that you have been targeting or could it be more in line with the overall topline growth of sort of mid-teens and what segments are going to be driving the largest growth in any segments that will lag the growth? Sure. Harlan, great question. We do feel good about where we are positioned. And as you know, I think we are fully integrated now and feel really good about the message we have for our customers. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we feel good about the progress we have made on the synergies.
We have seen the target that we laid out in 2023, we are on track. But to your point and Bren mentioned it, FPD will be down in calendar ‘21, which means -- and we think overall, the rest of the business if you take out FPD probably be up closer to 15%. So -- and FPD was relatively weak in ‘20.
So the parts of the business that were I think the most levered to in terms of the advanced packaging and a lot of the work that’s going on, where we have overlap with some of our existing front-end customers, really a lot of good progress, and as you know, Oreste is running that.
I think he’s confident that we can build on our success as we go forward, based on the interactions that we are having with customers. We feel good about specialty, PCB has been great and we have been really happy with the work that’s going on in the packaging inspection, the ICOS businesses. So those three are really hitting it and feel really good about it.
I also mentioned, we are seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously those are lower profitability businesses but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Harlan. Priscilla, looks like we are coming up on time here, I think we have time for one last question. We will take our final question today from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Hey, guys. Someone addressed it in answering Harlan’s question there, but I was looking at the wafer inspection business up 32%. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what’s driving that strength. Is it mostly GEN5? Is it Surfscan? And in the script, I think, you also mentioned some new applications in optical inspection? So I was just looking for some more color there. Yeah. It’s really related, Quinn, to the optical inspection in GEN4, GEN5. So it’s not just what we are seeing in GEN5. But GEN5 is certainly where we are seeing the increased application around specifically supporting EUV.
And there -- that’s -- we laid out that thesis at Investor Day. We haven’t really seen it at that time that we thought the print check. So when customers will print down the EUV and they will validate that image that was going to be an application. We believe there is a big market requirement for. That’s proving to be true and that’s driving a lot of the business success going forward.
The other thing that’s happening, of course, as EUV is becoming more prevalent then just in general scaling matters more smaller defects and that pushes the mix toward more GEN5 than perhaps would have been GEN4. So we are benefiting from both of those trends, new applications, additional scaling. Got it. Thank you. All right. We appreciate everybody’s time and interest. And I will pass the call back over to Priscilla to end. This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast.

I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining KLA’s earning calls today. KLA’s March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst the dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing.
Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers, and shareholders.
We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customer's needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA’s record results in momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership, two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce, and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model.
Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading-edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization.
As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. In this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January.
This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we are experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business. KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations.
KLA’s market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies, and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers’ purchasing decisions.
Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control.
Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCP product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailored to the automotive industry. This quarter expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward.
Calendar year 2021 is position to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customer's plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand.
We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, but the demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA’s essential role in supporting our customers drive to innovate and continuing to invest in future technology notes. Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA’s share of process control over 53% for the year.
KLA’s market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show, KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum and gains EBM inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic, the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors, driving equipment spending. KLA’s market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading-edge.
Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group.
Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our electronics packaging and components or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor – the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets.
With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors, and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA strengthened our engagement with the top five semiconductor market leaders in packaging. And we're expanding our reach with those sets.
KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid a $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record.
Last July KLA’s Board of Directors authorized the 11 consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA’s track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA’s March, 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA’s products and services and enabling the digital transformation with our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding and customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing.
We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range is stronger revenue in favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter.
Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%.
Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million to the June quarter. We were budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter or the near-term horizon.
Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years. We expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%.
Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%, and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM.
Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 28% year-over-year with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection.
Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agents. In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow.
As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January, where we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low-to-mid 20s with a bias to the upside at calendar 2021 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments.
Also in earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year 2021. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021, relative to the overall WFE market.
Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenues expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter.
Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.8. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. In closing the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets in a multiple technology nodes. We’re encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment.
KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we're on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustain technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, we're ready to queue for questions. [Operator Instructions] We’ll now take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulate on a really strong results. Rick or Bren, the first question I had was you're guiding to WFE obviously update since three months ago, similarly the mid-20 range. I'm kind of curious, if I look at some of your peers, they're talking about 30% range, but either way from your vantage point, how do you think KLA has any process controlled revenues are going to do relative to your mid-20’s WFE growth on a calendar of 2021 basis, and then I have a follow-up. Yes, Krish. Thanks for the comments. Hey, I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why I put the baseline in there. So I said that against the baseline of 2020 of $61 billion, we saw a – we see growth from there in the low-to-mid 20s percentile as – with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that, that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE, and certainly the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments. So we feel pretty good, not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us, we have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry. Got it. Super helpful, Bren. And then as a follow-up, and thanks for the color on the market share data from last year. I'm just looking more – looking ahead, can you talk a little bit for the market share dynamics, obviously a large U.S. company has spoken about gaining traction in process control, introduced a new optical inspection tool with the EB combo along with AI. So I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that impact, especially in foundry and logic? Or how do you kind of counteract that especially given that you are obviously the leader in this space today? Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said, and we view process control in 2021 is outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 – 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the gardener data, as we highlighted over time, KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share.
And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but – and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we’re also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so, so we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall at a corporate level you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength. Got it. Really helpful. Thank you. And we will move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just first on the gross margin in the March quarter, what drove the upside and I guess importantly, as you look at June and full calendar year guide, what are the assumptions that you're making for kind of mix? And to what extent are you above target because of cyclical, because of mix, or should we just start thinking about 62 plus is being kind of a new target? Yes, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business. And as Rick just mentioned and that's a richer business for us overall. So that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It’s still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC, and so that's diluted from that standpoint.
But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities – the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year, certainly the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about on prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more biased to the upper end of that range.
So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth and optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business. That's helpful. And then Rick as my follow-up going back to kind of the market share question, which I think is one of the key investor concerns out there. I think the concern that some investors have is that as we hit this inflection from optical to more exotic like – sources like e-beam an x-ray, there is sort of a view that the incumbency advantage kind of goes away. And perhaps we're all kind of estimating that inflection to happen more quickly than it will. But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world? How does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies? Yes, thanks, John. I think the – I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. There is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi beam – e-beam solution are KLA, we're the ones that have it, that we're developing and introducing in the radical space which is I think – where it's needed the most.
So we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change, the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that Bren and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which has it slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition, it hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make at e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam – pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea, that's been around quite a while, and at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening. John, I’d just add – I'm sorry, just one other thing – I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right, so we talked about the accelerated growth relative to the market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right, that's the market, that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So to give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here, that's validating, I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways. And Rick, does the incumbency advantage you enjoy at optical transferable as the world starts to move to e-beam? Yes. John, I – again, I don't think the world is going to move large scale to e-beam. I mean, we're well-positioned if it does, but I just don't think that the – I think there is going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still on the early iterations. We have more capability to add to GEN5, it's – we've been adding – have for awhile added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy, especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s, even past when we get the high end – EUV, and remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that.
So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market. Not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capabilities just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam. Great color. Thank you. We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, Rick, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment around process control outgrowing WFE, and to me logically, when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and process control would underperform, not any hit to you, but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. And here you've outlined mid-20s kind of growth for the industry, whereas we've heard 37% growth from ASML, we've got 30 plus percent growth from Lam. How in that world does process control outperform? Is it Intel coming back? Is it at mask inspection spend from China, what are the moving parts that can allow that to happen? Yes, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details. But if you – if we assume the market is, let's say, just pick a number 22% WFE growth this year, what we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is – will significantly outgrow that. I don't know if it'll be 38%, but it'll probably start with a 3, in terms of what it is. Now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that businesses and calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across his portfolio, I get pulled into them occasionally, but that's the conversation, it’s how can we support that.
And when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on to your other question CJ, it's – of course it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules, it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year. And we know what Intel has said publicly, but it's not just that we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for – specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in. Yes CJ, I always struggle a little bit with these questions just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, that KLA’s performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went from $50 million to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi-PC equipment, it was in that ballpark.
So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus I think that's where the industry is against the $61 million baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks and against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes, I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here, but that's – I think that's how I see it at this point. Yes. Very helpful. As my follow-up, you alluded to supply constraints or adding on additional capacity. We'd love to hear – you guys typically run your business to roughly seven months backlog, has that extended? And I guess, how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model, either gross margins of OpEx, if at all? And if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of seven month timeframe, do you have visibility now into the first half of 2022? Thank you. Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can, now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high end systems, the timing to procure and optical components, and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six, and we're probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today.
And capacity is coming online, really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories worldwide. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers, suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that.
So I think given the expectations around six months of – in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we’re facing. At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead time. So all those activities are ongoing, and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself. Thanks, Bren. And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of – I don't see anything falling off anytime soon. Thanks, CJ. We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Okay, good afternoon. Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In foundry I know most of the discussion has been focused on leading edge, but there is significant wafer tightness on lag in the c-mass technologies 16, 28, 40 nanometer and higher. I know your sweet spot is advanced technologies, but there is some part of the demand strength in process control coming from these bagging-edge processes as capacity gets built out. So what percentage of your business and process control is exposed to mature technology nodes? So the full China, all the business in China I’d classify as mature. And most of that is pretty boundary weighted this year. There is some wafer investment that's happening, there is some memory investment, but I'd still say it's probably greater than 60%, 65% boundary, I don't have it in front of me. And so you've got that, plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue, I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%. Perfect. Just to add to it. It's not just tight there as you know, it's tight everywhere. And so you do remember years ago, if you think back to when there was one product and that would transition to the next product and people would reuse capabilities, that's really not an option now. And so what you get is that heavily utilization that benefits that sales, but also we see that in service. So that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service. Great, good insights there. And then as a follow-on, I mean, on the EPC business with – again with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial focused and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates. I would assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPCs portfolio of products, because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB. And I think last call, I think your view was that x-display that EPC would go 15% this year, but just given the strong demand for analog RF, power transistors, advanced substrates, PCB capacity. Do you guys have a new view of EPC growth for this year? We do. I think you hit it, and again, if you take out the display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by – and we talked about this in past Harlan, but by 5G largely if you think about it, most of 2020 and early. Now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive. And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that in some other factors that would have contributed to this chip shortage.
And so now they're back on and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC as PTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yields, which is really the near-term, the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield. Yes, Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that the expectations about – for EPC are in the mid-teens. So with that reflects some of the growth drivers in growth that we're seeing in the businesses that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half, I think it will be reasonably balanced. We are doing a ERP integration on one of those businesses. And so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that. But pretty consistent level of business, and as I said overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of meet 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're at with those businesses and particularly on that growth, I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those – in that group really pleased with the operating leverage as well. Great insights. Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. You mentioned China and that the activity is mostly foundry. Can you give us an update on how big you see the China sovereign business, how much growth you see coming this year? And how fragmented is it, how many different customers are you seeing that are kind of spread out across that WFE? It would probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented lots of customers. Okay, great. And also included in that Joe – Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening, where you're in mask, where there some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem. Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then as it comes – pertains to regulation, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the export controls reform, that's kind of going through. I guess, do you feel like the equipment industry in KLA specifically has kind of a voice in the government in terms of the direction of these things and – or is it kind of more dictated by the semiconductor customers? Just how big is the lobbying kind of government affairs efforts from the equipment companies these days? Joe, I think what's really happened is there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might've been unilateral action if you go back a year or so. And it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now it's going to be multilateral. It's going to be thoughtful. And we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there's a constructive dialogue around that, and it's not just the semiconductor guys. It's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. And we'll move now to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. On EUV, I’m just curious you talked a lot about process control intensity, clearly benefiting from EUV. But I guess at 3-nanometer, we're starting to see a big step up in the number of EUV layers. Is that something we should think about as maybe an incremental driver is for you guys? Yes, Joe, for sure. I mean, we're having, as you know, the development work, there's a lot of process control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development for our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the radicals and when they're printed that the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of Gen 5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects.
So in general, that shifts the dynamic. If you thought about a blend between Gen 4 and Gen 5, Gen 4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being Gen 5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on Gen 5 as we move forward. I think we mentioned I the past, Gen 5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced.
So those are just two areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges, but in general, the process control challenges as we move forward especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development.
So Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers in these no transitions that forced customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements. And so the ability to reuse a lot of the capacity they might've purchased in a prior node is harder because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening. Today, particularly at the 5-nanometre node, but then also the technical drivers of that, even if they could use the tool, it doesn't meet the technical requirements. So that's another factor that drives intensity, that's pretty important to our overall business. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Bren, on the capacity increasing for your manufacturing footprint, I mean, how do we think about your planning in terms of, supporting overall WFE? Because I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about sustained growth looking even into next year? Yes. Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the windows that we talk about. Just in general that we think that we – there is no upper limit, right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly, there's some time to some of the lead time on our parts, but whether it's facilities, we like to think about people, parts and space at KLA, typically our long-term goal is around parts around some of the components we talked about.
So we're going to continue to add capacity and send a strong signals into a supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will based on customer readiness and customer expectations. We'll do what we need to continue to support those activities as we go forward, even beyond 2021. So I'm not worried about our ability though. I'm worried with that we're challenged and it's not easy, and there's a lot of work going on here. But at the same time, we know how to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in. Thanks Joe. Perfect, thank you. And we’ll move next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. Thank you very much and congrats. Rick, not to make you sound old, but you've been in this industry for awhile given that you've seen previous cycles and how they've acted in terms of these kinds of first volumes, where you've had to accelerate capacity. Bren, just mentioned that he's not particularly worried about meeting customer demand, but as we get into the secular change in terms of the industry where we may have sustained an elevated spending, how do you look at, I guess meeting the challenges of supply as well as meeting customer demand, particularly for both, for new tools for their needs, how do you manage potentially an extended period of spending at very elevated levels? Yes, Patrick. Thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle as I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on though, is to look at follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue.
And you just knew that couldn't last, right. So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean, there are some examples where customers are investing in, and we see this in China where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment. But those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low.
And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step up to get to support these new drivers.
And I would imagine it presumes it's growth at a more reasonable, upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of modeled. But the step up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing.
I do think this is a step up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think that the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives. And that's really the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick? No, that's very helpful. And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you the follow-up as well. As we look forward and we know process control does get, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of Gen 5. As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes, the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition of structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA? Yes, I think it's a great question. Just as you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance, to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate all around is an interesting one, because there it's actually an adaptation to Gen 4, that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices.
So we think that'll be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall, and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60/40, maybe even 65/35, that it'll be the advanced design rules that drive it more.
And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing, even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that will base anytime soon. Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. We'll move next to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Hi, thanks a lot. I guess, I had the first question was on the whole e-beam versus optical thing. Applied to launch the enlightened tool in March and idea that you combine optical and e-beam and you do synchronizing to sort of determine what defects matter. You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with the eSL10. So I guess, conceptually, it's not new, but they had a pretty strong e-beam review presence. So I guess in theory, that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market and your position? Yes, Tim. Thank you for remembering what we said in 2019. I could go back even further when we introduced some spec back years and years ago, and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the 90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that – the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is, do you have systemic defects? Do you really – can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the AI? If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean, there are very few, so you need to cover a lot of area. And that's what optical is really good at.
The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA sweet-spot for years, and we continue to do that. So I don't think that the announcement of two and a half year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary, other than –it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result.
I do think that increasing the capability, the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of, and that'll help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has in general, we'll be able to move forward. But I don't think this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might've been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers. Thanks, Rick. And then, I guess just last thing for me, so service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total, rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys given the nature of their technologies, some of their tools eat themselves. So, obviously it's sort of like apples and oranges there, but some of them also were sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that. And they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster? Thanks. Yes, Tim. I mean, I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that, and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for – when customers buy process control, they buy what they need. And then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure and ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things.
So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to the process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream.
I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the – in the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements. Particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today, with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required.
And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement. That's happening through our service business with those customers to support the install base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you see them staying in service. And that's what, it's probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer. And some of these other markets are inflecting. Okay. Thanks. And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. You will be at your 2023 target model this year, basically two years ahead, but that seems to have been driven a lot more by market growth, rather than I think in your target model, you had penciled in one to two points of share gains. And I know Rick, you highlighted a third-party survey that had your share kind of slipping a little bit last year.
I'm just curious, when do you think we should start expecting share gains for you over the next few years. And will that be driven by the launch of new products or will that be driven by share in a like-to-like category, will that be driven by spending being more foundry/logic based. Just how do we think about what you had talked about share gains at the analyst day versus what you have seen so far and how we should think about this share shift over the next one to two years? Yes, Vivek, I'll take the first part and let Bren talk about model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the analyst day. In 2019, we gained 3.3 – 3% share and that got a 0.7 down. This is what the survey says, but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year.
So I mean, these things move – annually it’s kind of hard because there are puts and takes, but competitively we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had today.
And then Bren can talk more about the model. From a top line point of view, you're right. It's been – what's driven, it mostly has been, yes. We had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions.
We talked about radical inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the radical inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenues, almost irrespective of the WFE level.
If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call the normal products and the regular products and share opportunities driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about 2021 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products.
So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still coming over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that.
And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue, that's growing what we saw in calendar 2020, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about four points in operating margin today. Do I think that that's sustainable at four points? Probably not, but do I think there's a couple points for sure sustainability there, I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. So yes, we're I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters. If I can squeeze in a quick one, automotive, from your perspective, when do you think the automotive industry is able to address all these supply shortages that it's seeing from the semiconductor industry? I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand. But I know that, there've been contributing factors and you've heard of some of them. Projects that weren't started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than them and retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but they're the best people to ask for that. Thanks Vivek. Sorry, I’m just going to conclude the Q&A and turn the call back to you, Kevin. Yes. Sorry about that. Again, we appreciate everybody's time. We know it's been a bit very busy week for earnings, very busy day for earnings.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you. And welcome to KLA's fiscal Q4 2021 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. With me on today's call is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2021.

Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom-line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading-edge R&D efforts.
Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision, and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams, continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace.
I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022.
As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge development, fab optimization, and regional expansion, KLA offers a leading portfolio of products to solve our customer's challenges. We continue to invest in high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we are prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities and leveraging these technologies in our product and service offerings help drive adoption, differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics, and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings to deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improve time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers.
Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing, KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4 times the nearest competitor, as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position when -- within the electronics ecosystem through our Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out the KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy. With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations.
Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base.
In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced four new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpartnered wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solution is aimed to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers.
Second, KLA's strong market leadership in optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, for product segments over $1 billion of revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2 times this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020.
Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation EBM-based 8xx [ph] mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below.
Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales, 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry.
Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates, and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semiconductor process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8 times faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth.
Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announce that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders.
Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge.
KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren. Thank you, Rick. KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.
Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A.
At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn help sustain our technology and market leadership.
Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40%. Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon.
Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed its initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million, cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million. The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter-end.
Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared to June of last year. The approximate semiconductor process control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%.
In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty semiconductor process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products.
Specialty semiconductor process's performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection.
KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from Baa1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance. We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing the balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns that at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment.
Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion, and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million of free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends.
Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments.
KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms, in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half, as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support the strong customer demand. Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in semiconductor process control equipment systems in the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high-30s to low-40s year-over-year percentage growth for the semiconductor process control systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market.
Our September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 59%, and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers.
Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward.
Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million, other income and expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 the $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares.
In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customer's multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future.
KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence, and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong financial performance, and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders.
And with, that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Thanks, Bren. Britney, can you please queue up for questions? [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. EUV adoption continues strong. And if I look at the outlook for EUV Litho systems expected to grow like mid-30% this year. Do you have a positive exposure here via your wafer inspection systems, but also the strong leadership in EUV mask inspection and printed. I know this doesn't represent your entire process control business, but it's sort of a good proxy. But you guys are guiding your optical inspection, your mask inspection, and your overall process control business to go well above that range. So, what are the two or three dynamics that are driving the strength above EUV adoption? And more importantly, with the visibility that you guys have, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the overall second-half momentum into the first half of next calendar year? Hey Harlan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio driven. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is, it's a pretty good mix between Gen 4 and Gen 5. So, both of the -- Gen 5 is more exposed, I would say to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of Gen 4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of memory, logic, foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory; that's one area. We mentioned also reticles having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So, we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. That's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. Bren, you want to provide more color? Yes. So, as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So, there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms and also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. Also 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changed all that much in the double patterning environment. As we move to EUV, reticle complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So, I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22. I appreciate that. And then on the gross margin front, if you could just help us understand the upticking in our gross margins into the September quarter. It looks like component costs are rising, I'm assuming the team also has to pay expedite fees for some parts and your end market mix is more weighted towards memory, which I would think would have some slight negative bias on gross margins. So, it's great to see the team driving the margin profile higher, but just help us understand some of the drivers of that? Customer mix doesn't impact our margin profile, our products across all segments have the same margin profile. So, it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the quarter-to-quarter, 50 basis point increase we have. Most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi-process control systems and those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or EPC business. So, that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher, those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters.
On the component side, there is pressure on components, there is pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically, for the frames of our tools. So, we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world, we have factories in different locations but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So, far it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So, we worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable. But I do expect we'll see some pressure on components. The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model, not a cost-based model. But we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through.
With these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward. Great insights. Thank you. And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Yes. Thanks, Rick, Bren. Congratulation on the strong quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I wanted to go back to your prepared comments about the investments that you're making in AI and ML. I mean clearly, some of your peers have talked about big investments in that area. I'd be curious if you can help us understand how you think you might differ from theirs? How -- maybe your incompetency [ph] gives you an upper hand here. And as you think about this, is this a way to maintain already outstanding share? Or do you think there is actually incremental revenue and SAM capability as you bring this out? And Bren, maybe on the gross margin; what could be the influence to gross margin? I'm assuming this is mainly software IP, which -- would it seem to be gross margin accretive? John, thanks for the question. We've been working on what has been -- what is now called AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data in our systems, especially in optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for a signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is, just extracting more information out of that data. So, as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another but we continue to add upgrades. So, I think to answer your question, one way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms in the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to shift [ph] wavelengths for example to get more capability, we can do that with algorithm. So, one of the questions that had been brought up in the past was, for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why EBM was going to maybe take a large prior of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability, that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems. So, I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products, part of why Gen 4 has a longer life now is, we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it.
To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products, those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology but also some of our traditionally lower-end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability [ph]. So, it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume, because you're -- we do make a large investment. We're by far -- we have the most investment going on, no question among our peers because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So, Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L. Yes, John. And I think it's much more of an operating margin statement or a reduction in R&D intensity is another way to about it. Platform extendability is one of the biggest decisions we make in our product lifecycle processes. We're making choices and we can extend platforms. It means that over time we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So, by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins. Now, in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company not just within semi-process control, where we have businesses. Now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels, but we're selling software directly and we have that there, and we also have it in the EPC business where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings.
So, there is a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology roadmaps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time. Thank you very much. Thanks, John. And we will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. As you think about your implied revenue guide for December, it looks like it's about $250 million of process control. And it sounds like that is coming on, based on new manufacturing capabilities that you're bringing online. So curious, what's the impact to gross margins at that time frame? And will that satisfy all pent-up demand? Or will your lead times still be extended heading into calendar '22? Yes, CJ. It's a great question. As far as lead times go, I think lead times are holding pretty flat. One of the challenges and we had hoped that we'd start to see those pull in a bit, but demand has continued to increase. So we're seeing stronger demand and we're doing a lot of work to add capacity, so things are extending out, but they're not necessarily pulling in either. Yes, based on our comments, you do have a ramp in our -- in semi-process control equipment into the December quarter, that's a richer mix. So, I'm not going to guide December but that should carry a richer gross margin profile, given the nature of the products that we're shipping. That capacity has come online, that's a revenue recognition dynamics related to new facilities and product transitions that's pushing some of those shipments if you will that are happening this quarter that will happen next quarter. So, that's also part of the higher sequential growth that we're seeing into the December quarter.
Did I answer your questions? Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak a second one in. As you think about your foundry logic outlook for 2022 and you talked about continued strength, I was hoping you could speak to perhaps any changes that you see in the landscape whether leading-edge, lagging-edge, EUV adoption, DRAM anything we should be thinking about portfolio wise that could be a little different than 2021? Yes. Really, I think just in terms of overall sustainability, we would expect to see the leading edge continue to invest as we go into next year. And given the public statements that have been made there, I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the trailing edge side, we are seeing orders that are coming into backlog, but also in the funnel from a number of customers and much more meaningful levels of customers that haven't invested all that much in the past and are addressing some of these automotive and industrial, and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So, I would think from a shipment and revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into 2022. China has been mostly logic-centric this year, native China. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth.
Certainly, there is -- I think sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year but I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the one area we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So, I think those are the dynamics and how they're planned. I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21. But CJ, I mean, just one thing to add, a lot of the business that we're booking now is revenue in '22. I mean that's part of our confidence in '22. We're filled out for '21. And so, that's part of what we're seeing. And then some of the players you know who are trying to regain the lead, a lot of that investment hasn't really shown up in our revenue numbers yet. Very helpful. Thank you. And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. I had two of them. First one for Rick or Bren. I do want to have the December quarter question a different way, you said your semi-process control should grow 40% this year, and a half or half is mid-teens growth. So, if I look at that, it looks like December quarter is around $2.3 billion, give or take. Is that a decent proxy for December revenues? And are you not seeing any impact from any of the component shortages that's affecting some of your friends in the industry? And then I had a follow-up. Yes. So I'm not going to guide December specifically. What we're trying to do is give you some perspective on our expectations for growth of semiconductor process control equipment for the year, that was the high '30s to low 40 statement. We also talked about the total company growing mid-teens half to half, and so that was another statement there as well. So, I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided. Components are a daily challenge, we are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long term, and so, we have to make decisions and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into '22. So, it's a challenge, we're working our way through it.
I'm spending more time -- I've been with KLA for 21 years and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have. And certainly, as a CFO since 2013; so, we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it, and the guidance and context we provided contemplates what we expect to happen. It's our best expectations based on what we know today. Got it. Thanks, Bren. And then, just as a follow-up, I do got a question on China. Obviously, you had really strong sales there in the June quarter. And if I try to back out, your ex-China sales had actually declined from March to June. And you also said China is mostly logic, so I'm kind of curious, are there that many logic foundry players in China? Or is this just a long tail of smaller players buying equipment? And any kind of color you can give on China with regards to your sales and any kind of split between domestic and MNCs would be very helpful. Thank you. Yes. You have to remember that when we just talk about our mix of business that's the total company, so that includes EPC. So, I believe, our China percentage was like 32%. If you looked at the native investment as a percent of our semiconductor process control segment, it's about 25%. So, the numbers, when you're extrapolating like that can lead you to different conclusions. There are a number of small projects that are logic-centric projects in China that are targeting specific markets around IoT and image sensors, and a bunch of those kinds of opportunity is obviously, automotive and industrial. So, I think there are new projects in a lot of cases which are going to be coming online over time. But there is a lot of activity there. So, yes, there are. Got it. Thank you very much. And we will take our next question from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about -- you mentioned having new products for the automotive sector. And how are you thinking about this, you sort of see the older foundry nodes, looks like it's going to be a source of sustainable strength for a while. Can you actually target that business a little bit more directly than you have? And just generally, what kind of activity are you seeing in the older foundry nodes? Yes. Sure, Joseph. We've actually been engaged for quite a while with some of the leading automotive -- even the automotive customers coming to us asking us to help them with their suppliers. That's been going on for a few years. What's really happened now is, it's broadened, the number of customers that are recognizing and of course the shortage of automotive semiconductors contributed to that. So, we've been developing products that have, I would say, are adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, whereas you know, they're looking for more reliability, there is some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs. So, yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start to 2020 where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on.
And so, we do have those products, we're engaging with customers, and there is a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So, we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that and it's also where our business that we got through, Orbotech, SPTS works also some of the process capability there. So, it's more than just inspection, it's broader for us than that. So, it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area and I think it's one that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters. Thank you very much. And we will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Curious on your advanced packaging. You recently talked about packaging becoming more like front-end. I was curious you know, how would you compare maybe contrast the two in terms of just the increasing capital intensity. And then maybe can you touch on your position in front-end and how that maybe drive differentiation for the packaging? Joe, I think there's a couple of things. One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there is more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their best behind a proven player. So, we have the capability. We have some products. We're doing some product developments, some product adaptations in support of that, but the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is of course in the leading edge, but the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth of process control. So, I would say, we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so, we're engaging with our customers in that.
And I can tell you, we're getting as much pool there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their roadmap. So, we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity and it's not just process control, once again some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement. So, we do see strong growth. We see a lot of potential consistent with the plans we laid out in 2019 at our Investor Day. You also have the integration of the PCB board to IC substrate into the package and so that's a good driver for us moving forward. We're working on new capability to better address that market. We also -- the ICOS' finished component inspection business is inspecting the packages, so that complexity is also driving an inflection in that market. We're seeing very strong growth in that market as well. Probably the fastest-growing part of EPC is today is through ICOS. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities as Rick said and some of it's dependent on us bringing new capability to market. But certainly, customers are trying to leverage the different positions we have across a number of different applications, trying to leverage the relationship with us to do more there. Yes. And just to put a number on it, we said $400 million in 2019. We're ahead of plan and we can beat that, do more than that with some of the developments we're contemplating. So, I think we've got the products now to perform to that and we can do more. And we're getting encouraged by the signs that we're seeing and engaging with these customers. Super helpful. Thank you. We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. Rick, maybe first off, big picture, kind of the long-term outlook for the process control industry and your positioning gate-all-around [ph] is becoming or it will be coming on board in the next few years. And I know you probably are working with your customers. You've got an incremental benefit when the industry transitions to FinFET transistors. How do you see the incremental opportunities as you go to gate-all-around where not only are you seeing new materials but more materials in that transistor area. Yes, it's a great question. And as you know, with all our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So, I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters, because in the case of gate-all-around, adaptation to the Gen 4 wafer inspection in some ways is more important than what Gen 5 does. Gen 5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates but Gen 4 for the contrast. And so, some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. So, I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of half a percentage point if we're going from 15 to 15.5 depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between logic and memory.
But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections, provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So, we feel like we're really good position to support our customers to do that. Great, that's helpful. And my follow-up question may be for you, Bren, in terms of the investments you're making. We talked about systems, picking up expanding capacity, bringing people on board to meet the increased shipments. Services are also growing quite rapidly and you've mentioned that, it's growing faster than the target CAGR you are looking at. What are the types of investments you need to make in services given that not only is your semi services growing as the installed base grows, but PCB tends to be a very service-intensive business as well. And that marketplace is also showing signs of some more secular growth trend given some of the marketplaces that they penetrated. How do you look at service investments, both near term and over the next few years? That's a great question. And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service business is of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been one of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint. So, being able to leverage our infrastructure now the go-to-market is different, how we engage with those customers is different. So, leveraging the infrastructure we have is I think a big part of that so there is a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if we see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so, whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA.
We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities, so we can do a lot more diagnostic, these diagnosis tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation. So, I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing and it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using them from a utilization point of view. Yes. And then, the biggest investment really right now is in the workforce to support that. And so, as Bren mentioned, we're working on that. I think that hiring, training, on-boarding as we anticipate the continued growth is an area we've done well with. But as you know, there is a big demand for talent out there. So, we have to keep on it, keep hiring and doing that training. So, that's probably the biggest area of investment, over time that's going to be the workforce. Great, thank you. And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks. I had two clarifications, Bren. And then I had a real question. The first two clarifications are, the comment you made about 15% half-on-half, that was a corporate revenue comment. Somebody attach that to a process control systems, but I don't think -- I think your process control systems comment was up like mid-30, high-30s to 40% for the year. That half-on-half comment was a corporate revenue comment. Correct? That's correct, yes. And I attempted to clarify that in one of the earlier questions. But yes, you're right. That's the total company aggregate revenue expectation second half versus first half, mid-teens. Perfect. And then the second clarification, did you say that domestic China is 25% of your process control systems revenue. Because WFE, it's like 15% of total WFE. In the quarter that we just completed. Yes. Okay, got it. Okay. So for my real question, I guess. So I wanted to ask about actinic. And it's always really been Tier to high NA for EUV. Otherwise, you use the 8xx and now you have the big microprocessor maker that's now pushing more aggressively on high NA. So, are you going to accelerate your development timeline for actinic? Yes. Tim, it's a great question. We feel confident that we will have the capability we need when it is needed for the high NA. So, I understand what your question is, we believe that with the products that we have, with the 8xx in particular, and actually the continued capability we're seeing in 6xx, we feel that we will be there when the market is needed for the high NA. Hey, Tim, just to also clarify on the China statement. So, that's of the semiconductor process control segment, which includes the service. It was 25% of the revenue in the June quarter. I see, including service. Okay, Bren. Thank you so much. And we will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if let's say hypothetically, WFE is 90 billion or 100 billion next year, are you prepared to support that right from your capacity perspective? Or I guess a different way of asking the question is, how much additional capacity are you planning to bring online next year? Yes Vivek, that's an interesting question. And right now, what we're trying to do is ramp up to support the customer demand that we have. And I have expectations for incremental capacity as we move forward now. I feel like these are good investments to make for us over the long run given our expectations for multi-year growth in WFE. I think given the strength of the WFE investments in some of the end market drivers that we're talking about, that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that. So, these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward sort of a through cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand.
So, I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year, in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and in our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that. I think the one thing I would add is, we are cognizant of our customers' desire to get more capability sooner and we're doing everything we can to size it. But the numbers you've talked about, we have contemplated in our plans. Maybe a quick follow-up if I can. At what point do you sense that because of all the headlines around the capacity crunch, you have players who are now trying to become foundries on their own. That there is a pull-forward of demand that at what -- what's on your dashboard to tell you that whatever you're shipping right that the utilization levels are quite high and it's not just customers scrambling to add more capacity. Like, do you track what the usage is of the equipment that you ship? Yes. Of course, we track the usage. I mean that's a metric that we're looking at all the time. But I would back up a little bit and say that the industry actually has a self-governing mechanism in it, which is the ability of all the equipment companies to ramp to the demand. And right now, when you talk to customers, they would take more shipments I think from everyone if they could get them sooner. So, there is a natural governance. And I'm sure you've heard, ASML talk about EUV through '22. So, it's naturally governed by that. So, I don't -- I think we're in a good place for a sustained run at this point. Thanks for that. Britney, we have time, it looks like for one last question. And we will take our final question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, speaking of this multiyear investment plans that you just talked about, there -- obviously, there is a lot of new fabs being announced in the past few months. When do you expect those new fab investment to start generating revenue for you? And when do you expect to start seeing those orders coming in? Well, in a lot of cases, we're already seeing the orders, right? So, I think that customers are getting into the queue for deliveries. And in some products, deliveries could be 12 months from now. So, it's absolutely happening and customers are trying to make those commitments as they're planning for their facilities. Obviously, they plan across a lot of different types of equipment. And so, those planning cycles tend to move around a little bit. Sometimes they are also dependent on winning business and product ramps and so on. So, there's always a little bit of variability around the timing. And then of course, generally as you try to build something, there's always infrastructure and delays and pull-ins that can happen associated with just construction overall. But yes, we're absolutely seeing that demand in the backlog and certainly in the sales funnel. Okay, great. Maybe my follow-up; it's a lot of questions on the semi process control side but, on the EPC business, is 15% growth for this year still a realistic assumption given the strength in auto and 5G? And maybe you can talk about with or without the display side of things. Thanks. Yes. Including display, we're in the high teens for that business. So, we're seeing strength there. Display is about as we expected and we're seeing strength, I mentioned earlier about component inspection. Especially, semiconductor is also seeing strength. PCB is ahead of plan a little bit so I think that's moving along. Obviously, it's very tied to mobility and 5G. So, yes, we're seeing that pick up in terms of expectations for growth out of that product group. Okay, great. Thanks. I would now like to turn the program back over to Kevin Kesseler -- Kessel, I apologize for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you very much. And wanted to thank everybody for their time, their interest, and their questions. We will be in touch. Take care. This concludes today's KLA Corporation June quarter 2021 post earnings call.

I’d like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thanks, Kevin. Before getting into KLA’s results in more detail, I want to acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. Their perseverance and drive to be better remains at the center of our consistent execution and outperformance.
You have remained focused despite challenging macro and supply chain conditions, as our high-performing teams that drove KLA’s indispensability to customers, resulting in additional Process Control market share growth for the recently ended year.
KLA’s March quarter results demonstrate strong execution across multiple areas of our business in a persistently challenging supply chain environment, delivering revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance ranges for the quarter. We once again displayed strong execution across multiple areas of our business.
Our focus on consistently meeting commitments and delivering on our long-term strategic objectives and financial targets is the hallmark for which KLA is known and the standard by which we measure our success.
Customer demand across major product groups continues to build as secular trends drive broad-based growth across a range of markets and applications served by the semiconductor industry. This robust demand has been putting pressure on the industry’s ability to supply semiconductors.
Simultaneously, our leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to improve their competitive positioning, while addressing growth in markets that demand new leading-edge semiconductor capabilities. Against this rising demand backdrop, KLA has remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and navigating supply chain challenges.
Very important that KLA continues to operate with purpose and precision, so we can create value for our customers, partners and shareholders by outperforming expectations. Our talented global teams both run and improve the KLA operating model, and use it as a critical guide to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the evolving marketplace.
The Market Leader and Process Control are one of the fastest growing segments of the overall WFE market, KLA remains in a position of strength when we look at the industry demand landscape.
Semiconductor industry has evolved to be more significantly strategic and has an increasingly less cyclical end market mix, with many fundamental drivers advancing the critical nature of semiconductors throughout the global economy.
Factors such as the continuing advancement of technology at the leading edge, increasing investment and legacy nodes, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging, are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor industry and for equipment and capabilities that make it possible.
Despite persistent supply challenges and macro headwinds, our outlook for the WFE industry this year remains intact, albeit with an expectation for a stronger second half than anticipated in January.
We expect WFE demand to top $100 billion this calendar year, making it the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. KLA’s expected growth in calendar 2022 will mark the seventh consecutive year of growth.
This sustained strength in customer demand is happening in an environment of increasing momentum for Process Control where KLA’s Market Leadership has strengthened further and our market share results remain 4x our nearest competitor.
KLA’s expanding lead is the result of our number one market position in some of the fastest growing segments in WFE that have a market size greater than $1 billion in terms of annual revenue.
We attribute KLA strengthening Market Leadership to our ongoing successful execution of the company’s customer-focused strategies, including investing at a high level to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical Process Control challenges in the marketplace and help our customers drive their growth strategy.
We are pleased to see the success of our strategies validated by our customers’ purchasing decisions and reflected in the April 2022 Gartner Market Share report, showing KLA’s Market Leadership advancement. This emphasizes the power of portfolio strategy we employ.
The recently published Gartner Market Share report shows Process Control was one of the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, growing 43% in the year to $10.4 billion. KLA’s share of Process Control grew approximately 1 percentage point to over 54% and has increased over 3 percentage points since 2018 and remains greater than 4 times our nearest competitor across all regions. Within Process Control, the optical inspection market grew to approximately $2.5 billion in annual sales, outpacing WFE by 40% and our share of this market remained above 80%.
Other highlights demonstrate the power of KLA’s portfolio strategy in delivering strong growth in other critical Process Control markets, including metrology, macro inspection and very strong growth in e-beam review.
Turning now to the top five highlights for the March 2022 quarter. First, KLA’s Market Leadership in some of the most critical and fastest-growing markets to WFE continues to fuel growth. We remain nimble and innovative in addressing global supply challenges to meet customer requirements and our financial targets. Foundry and Logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity remain a tailwind. In memory, demand is broad-based across multiple customers.
Second, our optical metrology business stood out in the March quarter, driven by KLA’s Market Leadership and increasing customer adoption of market applications and leading-edge technology development and capacity monitor. Optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and critical next-generation architects, including gate all around and multi-stack 160-plus layer 3D NAND. This was further illustrated in the new Gartner Market Share report, which showed 50% growth in 2021.
Third, KLA is intensifying our efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolio of both the SPC and EPC groups. KLA is broadening our product portfolio and delivering a comprehensive suite of products and technologies that include wafer-level packaging, and final assembly and test products for advanced packaging markets. And a portfolio of inspection systems and process tools designed to help customers achieve their zero defect goals. These collaborations continue to grow with KLA recording our highest ever customer engagement in terms of wafer inspection revenue for automotive applications in the March quarter.
Fourth, services revenue was $488 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company tallied a record 349 installs in the March quarter, well above the previous high of 293. This was a remarkable achievement given travel restrictions in Asia, lockdowns related to COVID-19 and complexities related to the supply -- current supply environment. Service revenue is consistently outperforming the 9% to 11% long-term growth target, driven by growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, higher utilization rates and expansion of service opportunities in the legacy notes.
Finally, the March quarter was another exceptional period from the free cash flow perspective. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $719 million or 23% year-over-year growth. We have also remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase programs, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including a $565 million of quarterly share repurchases and an additional $159 million in dividends in the March quarter.
Before passing the call over to Bren to review the financial highlights and guidance, let me summarize briefly. KLA’s March quarter demonstrates sustained outperformance, highlighting the critical nature of KLA’s products and services, and enabling the digital transformation of our lives.
Our consistent strong execution against significant challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of meeting rising demand and addressing persistent supply issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.
KLA is exceptionally positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput.
Semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we continue to see more customer interest driven by technology change than ever before at the leading edge. Simultaneously, the need for increasing performance and reliability requirements for legacy nodes to support evolving markets like automotive and 5G are also important to help deliver new capabilities.
We believe KLA will continue to benefit from numerous secular growth factors that drive long-term industry demand. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, with strong long-term operating leverage should provide durable free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bren. Thanks, Rick. Our results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. We continue to focus on meeting customer needs in a robust demand environment, while expanding Market Leadership, growing revenue, increasing gross and operating profit, generating strong free cash flow, maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.
Quarterly revenue was $2.289 billion at the upper end of the guided range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was above the midpoint of guidance at 62.9%, as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control Systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.13, also towards the upper end of the guided range of $4.35 to $5.25. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.83.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $484 million, below our expectation of $495 million, mostly due to the pace of new hiring, which was slower than originally planned. Total operating expenses were comprised of $285 million in R&D and $199 million in SG&A.
Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion of our business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model to facilitate growth. This includes investing in new product development programs and volume dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis.
Furthermore, we, as most companies, are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and adjustments related to our annual merit process that went into effect during March.
As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow to approximately $525 million in the June quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to trend higher over the balance of 2022, along with our sequential revenue growth expectations.
We continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over our normalized time horizon.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was once again strong at 41.7% in the March quarter. Other income and expense net was $46 million, compared with guidance of $41 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the mark-to-market impact of a strategic supply investment.
For the June quarter, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $43 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.6%, above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share at the guided tax rate would have been $5.20.
Non-GAAP net income was $776 million. GAAP net income was $731 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $79 million, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 93% and free cash flow margin of 31.4%.
Looking at revenue by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.98 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially as expected.
The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix for foundry logic customers was approximately 63%. Memory was approximately 37%, with a further breakdown comprised of 26% from DRAM customers and 11% from NAND.
Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in automotive, 5G and advanced packaging. Within EPC, the specialty semiconductor process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated revenue of $117 million, up 28% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially.
PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $193 million, down 6% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. For an additional breakdown of revenue by major products in region, please see the shareholder letter and slides.
In terms of the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in total cash, debt of $3.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agencies.
We have growing confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns to shareholders, that enables growing dividends and increased share repurchases.
Over the long-term, we target returning at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our capital return strategy underscores our strong record of predictable and productive capital deployment, and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis.
Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.3 to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $620 million in dividends paid. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and a strong free cash flow margin across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions.
Turning to the outlook. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook for calendar 2022 remains unchanged. We expect the WFE market to grow in the mid-teens to over $100 billion in 2022, off a higher base of approximately $87 billion in calendar 2021 after assessing reported results for the December quarter.
Although, based on pure company March reporting, it appears that industry supply issues will increase the loading in the second half of the year. This reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across all customer segments. While we add capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.
In addition, the duration and potential expansion of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are unknown and could adversely impact some suppliers with operations in the affected areas. Furthermore, these lockdowns could delay systems installations and customer acceptance processes, due to resource mobility restrictions in the country. In short, the situation is fluid and will be monitored closely.
Supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past three months. Still expect to see quarterly sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2022 and overall revenue growth for the calendar year to exceed 20%.
In addition, we believe that demand will continue to exceed supply through the remainder of the calendar year. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our Semiconductor Process Control business and strong relative growth overall.
Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile. Our bookings momentum and strong backlog positions us to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support this outlook and our customers’ growing Process Control requirements.
Our June quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.425 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 56% and memory is expected to be approximately 44% of Semiconductor Process Control Systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 66% of the segment and NAND is forecasted to be about 34%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%, as we expect sequential growth in EPC revenue in the quarter and slightly weaker product mix within Semi Process Control to dilute margins modestly versus the March quarter.
Longer term, infrastructure investments, labor cost inflation, supply chain strength and rising global logistics costs are surpassing the benefits of economies of scale normally seen in a rising revenue environment. Given expectations for revenue for the year, we continue to expect that calendar 2022 gross margins will be in a range of 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points.
Other model assumptions for the June quarter include; non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $525 million, other income and expense net of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $5.70 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.93 to $6.03. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 150 million shares.
In closing, the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE are compelling despite the current macroeconomic headwinds. Broad based customer demand and simultaneous investments across technology nodes are strong and resilient trends.
We have confidence in the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and bookings visibility, which motivates us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers’ multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future.
KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering.
They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, longstanding track record of strong free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Thank you, Bren. David, please queue for questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the solid execution. As you guys pointed out, the market share numbers are out for last year. You grew your Process Control market share at almost 55% or well over 4 times larger than your nearest competitor. I was looking at the data. So in the seven major categories under Process Control, you have the number one market share position in five of the seven categories. And the categories where you guys actually grew 50% -- more than 50% were pattern wafer inspection, overlay, metrology, macro inspection and review and classification. Obviously, all of these are very critical solutions for next-generation manufacturing technologies. So, on the strong growth outlook for this year, what areas or segments do you anticipate driving the outperformance and maybe even further share gains in your Process Control franchise for this year? Yeah. Harlan, I will go ahead and start, and let Rick add if he needs to here. But it was a very strong year, obviously, for the company and we are really pleased with the -- this year results. One of the things is we look at just our expectation this year is we expect to see continued momentum in a lot of the markets that you referenced. So there’s certainly strength that’s expected there.
We are expecting greater than market growth out of our reticle inspection business, which was a little slower than market last year and it tends to be a lumpier business. But as we move into this year, it should be a little bit stronger.
So, overall, we feel pretty good about the road map across our products. As we said in the prepared remarks, our biggest challenge is just getting the parts we need to meet the very strong customer demand that’s out there.
But we are encouraged by the momentum we have and our internal plan is to continue to gain share. We think there’s more opportunity for us, given what you said in terms of where we are. We go linearly, but at the same time, we have had a nice trajectory over the last few years and would expect to see it as we move forward. Yeah. Just to add a couple of things, Harlan. One is, of course, Gartner’s data is revenue and the bookings picture is even stronger. So we are in really good shape in terms of that. We have talked about the backlog and the demand that we have. So we will continue to see share gain in terms of our strength of share in the segments that you outlined.
Also, the new technologies that are coming offer more Process Control intensity opportunities. For example, High-K Metal-Gate. If you look at that, if you look at all around the metrology, bigger die size, all those things are going to allow there be more opportunity and we have products in the queue, as well as in the field that are going to take advantage of that.
So we feel very well-positioned. The biggest challenges we have talked about is satisfying demand and that’s related to -- we think we have done a really good job with supply chain, but there’s more work to do there to continue to support our customers. Yeah. Appreciate the insights there. And then on your EPC franchise, specialty semiconductor manufacturing, packaging, PCB, display franchises. It’s been a great diversification for the KLA business and I know going back and you guys will probably update us, but going back to the last Analyst Day, the team’s outlook for EPC was to grow that business at a 9% to 10% CAGR. You grew that business -- and this includes services, you grew that business about 15% last year. The two-year CAGR up to last year has been about 12%. So tracking ahead of your targets, what type of growth do you guys expect for EPC this calendar year, just given the strong focus by your semi customers on power, RF, sensors, advanced packaging and new PCB architectures? And maybe that’s been slightly offset by smartphone and display weakness, but wanted to get your views on EPC growth for this year. Yeah. Harlan, so in terms of the systems part of EPC, we are somewhere close to 20% is our expectation for the year. Obviously, we will have to see how that plays out. That tends to be a little bit of a shorter lead time business and have some parts of its markets that are a little bit more sensitive to some of the consumer dynamics.
But in general, we expect to see about a 20% growth there. Now if you blend it with its service business, it will be in a high-teen. The service business tends to grow a little bit slower than that. But you are right, over the last couple of years, on the system side, we have been in that 20% range and… Yeah. … it hasn’t gotten as much of a play as -- given the strength of our Semi Process Control business. But we are pleased with where we are going directionally there and we will have more to say about the longer term view at our Investor Day in mid-June. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question. Can you speak to your backlog, what your blended kind of lead times look like today and what kind of visibility that provides you into 2023? Yeah. CJ, it’s a great question. Right now blended lead times and they are blended across right products and the revenue value of the composition of the backlog. But it’s well over a year now in terms of where lead times are.
Obviously, certain product lines are longer than that. We are slotting certain product lines now today out into 2024. So, there’s quite a bit of demand for some of the products and given the constraints we have around key components and the lead time for those components, it just pushes that -- those lead times out.
So, overall, we have seen it trend up here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, as we go through the year, I continue to expect to see demand exceeding supply. So I would expect lead times to probably increase a little bit as we move over the course of the year. Very helpful. And my follow-up, curious on the China lockdown, any impact or future impact in your view, particularly around kind of PCB and display area, I would imagine that might be a downstream potential risk in terms of taking deliveries? Well, our guidance implies a risk adjusted assessment of where we are at. Obviously, there’s always some unknowns about that, both from a supply point of view, which we feel pretty good about, but also more so from just can we get access to customers, can we get tools installed, can we get acceptances done and so on.
We have contemplated that in the guidance we have given. We do have an expectation of seeing some opening begin in the, I will call it, sort of the middle of May. If things drift out further than that or there’s a significant expansion of lockdown activity, it could have more of an impact. But we -- I think we have risk adjusted it as best as we can. There’s certainly some unknowns. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. Thank you. We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. Bren, I wanted to try to probe a little bit on that question around backlog, because backlog really doesn’t mean a whole lot when your lead times are sitting beyond that 12-month window for backlog. So, I guess, the question is more on purchase obligations. I think you report that in the Q and it was greater than $8 billion, I think, exiting December. And so, I guess, the first question is sort of where does that stand now? I am just trying to get a sense of sort of how long book-to-bill is going to stay above 1 and maybe if you could give us backlog number? Yeah. So, Tim, you will see the exact number in the 10-Q that we file and it’s the performance obligations, not purchase commitments. But anyway, the performance obligations where you are right, we are over $8 billion last quarter and we will be in excess of $10 billion this quarter. And to my earlier comment, I think, we will see book-to-bill above 1 through the year. I guess I had a question also on Process Control System, so march came in like almost $100 million better than what I had and what I think your sort of guidance was implying. June is about in line. I think before, you were talking about the second half of the year, Process Control Systems being up sort of low- to mid-teens and I guess the question within that is, is that still the right number even though March came in a bit better? And part of that is a question really on timing, because the films guys, as you said, they are having problems shipping tools and so that is tending to push some WFE from the first half into the back half. And I guess, the question is, since you guys are sort of up-siding shipments and they are sort of down-siding shipments, does it become a problem for you where you have like timing mismatches and maybe -- because they can’t get film tools, maybe they start to push out your tools? Thanks. Yeah. Tim, usually, that doesn’t impact us all that much, because we tend to see Process Control tools going early. Also, given the demand environment, customers will deal with timing issues in terms of taking tools and storing them to align with expectations around the other tool sets.
So, I am less concerned about that given that the strength of demand. Customers are beating on us every day to ship sooner, so I am not concerned about delays and other types of tools impacting our products.
And you are right, we did have Q1 was stronger. Certainly, the execution by the teams in the last month as we dealt with a lot of delays in parts, particularly around automation for our systems, the execution was really solid and we are really pleased with the upside we saw in Q1. So, as I think about the second half, the second half, I am still in the same range, low- to mid-teens in terms of Semiconductor Process Control systems, so half-to-half versus the first half. Cool, Bren. Thank you very much. Thank you. We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious, how should we think about the -- you mentioned slower than planned or hiring in a difficult labor environment. I assume that’s more maybe geared towards 2023 or how do we think about that in terms of your ability to have enough labor to meet demand for this year? Joe, it’s Rick. It wasn’t really -- it was much more about the impact to cost about when they are hired. We actually didn’t quite well hire in Q1. It’s just if they are not hired at the beginning of the quarter and we factored in the payroll for the whole quarter.
We are on track for our hiring this year and most of that had to do, frankly, more with some of the engineering work than it does the work that’s associated with both operations and service where you could potentially, if you didn’t have the resources, see a shortfall for the year.
But even then, it was just -- right now we are trying to alleviate the teams who are doing a lot of overtime and trying to provide them to backfill. So, none of our hiring challenges are affecting our ability to support the revenue for this year and next year. But we do want to get people in and we have had good success, but it’s more -- we are talking months as opposed to quarters or years behind. Got it. That’s helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about the strength you saw in DRAM during the quarter and I think you even implied in the guide, I think, grew at record levels for Process Control Systems. Just kind of curious what drove that, if it’s architectural changes, EUV, anything like that would be helpful? Yeah. Joe, it’s mostly technology transitions this year, and certainly, the introduction of EUV and DRAM has been a driver for investment from our customers. It’s pretty broad, as I look at the DRAM investment. It’s pretty broad-based across our customer set. Thank you. We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Maybe first off for you, Rick. In terms of the advanced packaging market, you have done a great job in terms of getting the value proposition for front-end chipmakers with your Process Control solutions. Now some of these customers are the same ones on the advanced packaging side. Some of them obviously are OSAT and customers like that. As advanced packaging becomes a much more complex problem, how do you get the customer mindset change to get that same value proposition for those type of processes given the complexities that are occurring? Yeah. Good question. And one that -- obviously, we are excited about the EPC acquisition for exactly this. So I would say, really for EPC, even in earlier question we had about how we are doing and how we think about it, I really think of it in three stages. The first stage for EPC for KLA was to employ the operating model and how we run the businesses and that was really what we did initially.
The second stage was customer engagement, and because, as you say, some of these customers are bigger customers, more complex problems, and they know KLA, they wanted to engage with us. So that’s actually been going quite well and we have been having a lot of discussions.
But of course, then you get to the third part of that, which is technology leverage from the rest of KLA into EPC. And we are kind of in Phase 2 and Phase 3 now, where we have been having those meetings. There are a lot of clear opportunities for us and we are developing those solutions and rolling those out.
So I think that you will see the leverage, the revenue synergy associated from the additional channel access and the needs and then the benefit of our technology as we go forward. That’s really -- that’s coming. We are going to talk more about that at the Analyst Day in June as we roll that out. But right now, huge opportunities and we feel like we are just at time with that acquisition to be in a position to support them. Great. As my follow-up maybe for Bren. Given WFE, the outlook looks like it’s going to be a much more second half weighted year, particularly in terms of revenues and when the equipment companies receive cash. You guys have been executing well getting tools out on time. But we have heard from other companies where they are ‘shipping incomplete tools, where they will finish the install and get the revenue recognition later on. So to not expect a huge shipment ramp or a huge production ramp the second half of the year. How are you balancing those dynamics? Are you shipping any incomplete tools at the customer site where you can then go back later on so it doesn’t overly imbalance both shipments, as well as your revenue recognition? Yeah. Patrick, that’s a great question. And when you are talking about process tools, you have modular systems. And so they kind of come together at the customer site, in a lot of cases between the automation and then the gas boxes and the process chambers. And so if you are missing parts sometimes, you have that issue.
With our systems and we internally source the handlers for our systems. But our systems ship completely, and so they don’t come for the most part. I mean, we might have an issue here or there on the FPD business, where you will have a similar dynamic. And in some cases, there isn’t a reasonable carve-out based on the substance of the transaction, where you defer some of the revenue. But it’s a very, very small part of KLA.
So on our Semi Process Control part of the business, we are shipping complete systems and so you wouldn’t see a big correction in a deferred revenue that all of a sudden comes together as you move forward. So what we are shipping is complete systems and that’s what’s revenueing as we go forward. Great. Thank you. We will take our next question from Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I think my first question is, I wanted to understand if you have a sense of what the industry wafer capacity is expected to grow in this year and for the next year. So WFE is expected to be around the mid-teens growth for this year, like how does that translate to an increased capacity, if you can provide any color here. And I understand if you don’t have an industry view, maybe you could talk to a subset of your customers? That would be helpful. Yeah. So at least $100 billion in WFE. It’s translating and I don’t have the exact numbers, but we are seeing new wafer starts per month been added across all production nodes. And you are seeing it in memory at a limited level, certainly this year compared to prior years less, because it’s more of a technology transition focused year.
But certainly, on the foundry logic side, you are seeing increases in the 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer. 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer is probably flattish, but then you get 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer and above and sort of those nodes. You have got the legacy investment that’s happening there. So you are really seeing wafer start additions across just about all production nodes. So is that in line with WFE growth? That’s what I was trying to get at or is it -- so is that like an 18% increase or if you could help me characterize what kind of capacity increase that is? Yeah. I don’t think I can help you with that right now. Okay. By node, the capital intensity changes and so it’s not dollar-for-dollar in terms of how it applies to wafer starts at a given node. Got it. Okay. Okay. And for my follow-up, five to -- four to five years ago, most of the customers used to talk about reusing about 70% to 80% of their tools. How has this changed now? Is this -- is majority of the WFE spend on capacity additions, like how has that changed since, if you could help me understand? Yeah. That’s an interesting change in the dynamics of the industry and that was really more isolated to one period in time than if you look at the overall history of the industry and that was largely because there were not very many new starts on advanced nodes, there were primarily just a handful of customers, a handful of devices and so that reuse was something that happened when Moore’s Law wasn’t scaling. We are seeing very little reuse now and there’s a couple of reasons for that.
One of the primary reasons is the number of starts, the broad-based number of devices that’s being run on these nodes and the ability of more and more customers to support that. That means that our customers are running flat out those technology nodes as they are introducing new ones.
So we are actually seeing kind of the opposite effect, if you will. We are seeing some capacity, some of our sales are actually into ramps that historically, we would have considered to be done and they are actually buying tools, for example, for 7-nanometer right now.
There’s still some of that going on in spite of the new investment being advanced. So reuse is significantly down in terms of the amount and that’s a trend that our customers believe is going to continue as it’s going to be a focus on supporting that.
And if you look at the overall semiconductor shortage in the world, you can imagine that that’s not something that they can really afford to do, because they are running those old lines flat out and we see that in our service business and the overall fabulization around the world. Thanks. That’s helpful. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. This is Rob Mertens on behalf of Krish. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, looking into the services, you have been growing the business nicely. You mentioned a strong installed base component in the quarter and just in general. But looking at the attach rate opportunity, I think, you have mentioned maybe over 75% Process Control Systems and maybe 90% in PCB. Is there -- is that a fair assessment and is there further room to growth in terms of that side of the service business? Yeah. Look, certainly, as the tools increase in complexity and the demand on uptime increases, it does create opportunities for us to drive a contract model, a subscription-like model with those customers.
And so we do think there’s some upside potential over time and we will talk a little bit about some of the longer term drivers of our service business and its trajectory going forward at our Investor Day in June. But, obviously, PCB at closer to 90%, it’s hard to improve much on that, but I think that there’s still some opportunity on the semi PC side given the dynamics I mentioned.
One of the other opportunities we have in our acquired businesses is to try to drive more and higher attach on those tools in terms of service. And certainly, smaller players have a harder time having the infrastructure to be able to engage with customers to try to monetize that service business.
And so there’s opportunities for us in our specialty semiconductor business, our flat panel business and some other smaller acquisitions we have done to drive more service opportunity. We will have a lot more to say about it in June, but hopefully, that helps for now. Great. That’s helpful. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the WFE view you gave and sort of peers are indicating would assume that supply issues are going to sort of ease in the second half. What sort of incremental challenges have you seen within the industry over the past couple of months? Are there any sort of specific shortages, key components or is it sort of an ongoing rolling issue where things crop up and are dealt with and then other things pop up? Yeah. I think the whack-a-mole analogy is applicable here. It seems that as we work certain issues, other issues materialize. The dynamic in China with the COVID lockdowns does have some potential impact on some suppliers, although we think we have dealt with it and the guidance we have given in terms of just our assessment of the risk profile of that. But I would say, they are all the same issues and we just continue to work and the teams have done a really good job of it. Great. Thank you. We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. First one for maybe, Rick, if you can update us on your single beam eSL10 platform in terms of design wins and sales expectations this year. And the reason I asked that question is because we were at SPIE conference this year and it appears that the multi-e-beam platforms are showing limited flexibility and gaps to HVM manufacturing at logic makers like Intel. And then I have a follow-up. Yeah. I guess, the landscape, let me just generalize, and I would say, the e-beam inspection landscape has not really dramatically shifted. We have had some success, as we indicated, with the eSL10.
But if you back up and look more about the overall balance between optical and e-beam for inspection, it’s continuing remarkably to be at about that 80/20 split from optical to e-beam it’s been true for over the years.
So there are more e-beam applications, I think, that are showing up. The one for inspection, for example, that’s showing up that we are participating in uniquely is for reticle inspection and that’s what we are doing with our new 8XX to address the -- some of the opportunities in EUV.
But not really a lot has changed. I mean we go back and forth with the latest introductions from e-beam inspection. But by and large, we have had some success, but the market is on a relative basis. Overall, the EV market is about 20% to the 80% that is optical inspection. Bren, anything to add? No. I think they are complementary technologies and scaling into production is the challenges you mentioned. And even as you increase the beams, it doesn’t necessarily equate to a lot of throughput. It does equate to some, but there is still a challenge in the throughput disparity is quite significant relative to optical solutions.
So it’s relegated to defect discovery and engineering analysis type cases and doesn’t -- isn’t all that applicable to a production environment. And that’s -- I think it’s been very well validated, I think, with the strength that we have seen in optical pattern inspection over the last few years. Just one more example, I think, this is important to understand. If you look at calendar 2021, our Gen 4 optical actually outsold our Gen 5 optical in terms of amount of revenue in that split of the 80% of the market and then the rest was divided in the e-beam among the different e-beam players.
So this idea that the latest technologies would require e-beam inspection hasn’t been proven. In fact, if anything, it shows the extendability of optical as we -- even in 2021 and what we are seeing in 2022.
In fact, we expect the Gen 4 to continue to have significant success in terms of serving the overall inspection needs. So the view is they will be complementary, e-beam will primarily be a tool that will be used for engineering analysis but not for in-line inspection. Great. And then my follow-up, Bren, is it possible to break out the leading-edge sales, let’s say, 10-nanometer or below within your foundry logic sales? Yeah. It’s about 80% is leading edge. Thank you. Yeah. That might include 14, 16, but that’s only a few percent. So it’s safe to say that pretty much 80% or so is 10-nanometer and below. Got it. We will take our next question from Weston Twigg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments about reticle outgrowing the market this year. Can you just let us help us understand why it under grew a little bit last year, was it customer mix or is it just lumpiness and what makes you confident that you get faster than market growth this year? Well, yeah, last year, it was a very strong 2020 and then 2021 was below market growth. It was still an up year for the business, but below the market and then we do have more strength this year.
It tends to be lumpy. If you are thinking about mass shop systems, so our Teron Systems that we sell into the mass shop, those are very high dollar -- revenue dollar tool. So the ASP is quite high. So it -- they tend to skew the numbers a bit in that market given that.
But, certainly, we are seeing strength both in terms of EUV and new layers given the strength of foundry and logic, and that drives more reticle sets. And you have got, obviously, a lot of new designs, but you have re-spins of older designs and so that’s driving a lot of reticle demand.
That’s probably the biggest driver. You have also applications that are in the wafer fab for contamination monitoring. And we would also expect to see some revenue this year from the e-beam system that Rick mentioned as we get to the end of the year. So it’s -- I think it’s those factors that are driving that. Yeah. Wes, I would add one thing to it also is, we are talking about the reticle inspector. But if you look at the application itself of qualifying reticles, a lot of the success we had in 2021 and continue to have now is use of Gen 5 to qualify EUV reticles.
So, while it may not be the rapid systems we are selling, it’s the application in support of those, largely because that is the most effective way to determine the quality of those reticles is to actually inspect them.
And finally, we have the capability to do it on the wafers with Gen 5 and so we saw a huge push from customers, multiple customers, everyone who’s essentially doing EV or EUV to utilize Gen 5 to qualify those reticles. Okay. That’s helpful. And that actually leads to a follow-on question. Just as high NAEV comes down the pipeline over the next two or three years, do you have a solution ready for that, maybe leveraging your optical inspection platform or do you have to develop something novel? We have continued evolution of the platforms to support it and we continue to work on additional reticle capabilities to support it. So I think the answer is a little bit of both. I mean, the advantage of the on-wafer with the Gen 5 is that those tools already exist and so right now, they could inspect those, albeit at a slower throughput.
But of course, we are working on continuing to improve that capability both with increases in hardware, but also a lot of the work we have been doing with machine learning and AI and the algorithm front to support those applications.
And then at the same time, we have the 8XX, which will continue to support, as well as 6XX, and as I think you know, we also are working on next-generation reticle inspection as well. So, we got quite a bit of -- I think our two biggest investment programs inside the company are both dealing with the challenges of reticle inspection over the next several years. Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Wes. And it looks like that brings us to the end of the call. I wanted just to again remind everyone that we are hoping we can see you in person in New York, June the 16th.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Thank you and welcome to KLA’s fiscal Q4 2022 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some brief comments in our recent June quarter results before discussing our view of the semiconductor industry demand environment and then a few June quarter highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with some additional financial highlights from the quarter as well as our outlook and guidance.
I’d like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you all for joining us today. I’d like to begin with a few comments about the quarter. First, KLA continues to benefit from multiple growth drivers reflected in our June quarter results. Specifically for this quarter, our revenue of $2.5 billion was at the top end of our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.81, both at the top end of our guidance range. The talented global teams at KLA have remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and strategically navigating supply chain challenges. They are steadfast in their commitment to creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders.
Our teams continue to follow the KLA operating model as a guide to meet our challenges and benefit from the opportunities of an evolving market. Driving this performance, strong customer demand across major product groups, macroeconomic uncertainty and the resulting effects of consumer demand are areas we are monitoring closely. So our customers have indicated some end markets, specifically PCs and mobile devices have softened over the past few months and we have seen memory pricing in both segments weakened. While we have elevated concerns, we continue to see strong demand beyond our ability to supply from our customers with no material change in our shipment profile beyond the normal facility readiness issues and customers aligning tool deliveries with their production.
In assessing the full CY ‘22 WFE outlook, we have evaluated the persistent supply chain challenges and recently announced CapEx adjustment in the memory category. With this in mind, KLA’s outlook for WFE growth in ‘22 has tempered. Bren will expand more on the details when he discusses the outlook. We still see high single-digit WFE growth in calendar ‘22 and are confident in our ability to deliver relative WFE outperformance. We have supply chain challenges abate. This would be an additional upside. Process control is one of the fastest growing segments of the overall WFE market.
And as the market leader, KLA is in an inevitable position and fits the current demand landscape. We see continued investment in technology at the leading edge and increased demand for legacy nodes. We also see growth in technology categories, including advanced packaging. These factors all support steady long-term growth for the WFE category. We attribute KLA’s consistent and strengthening market leadership to our focus on investing in innovation at a high level to drive differentiation through a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges. Our technologies help our customers drive their growth strategy.
I’d like to now briefly summarize a few quarterly highlights. First, KLA continues to drive strong relative outperformance versus peers. In foundry logic, simultaneous investment across multiple nodes remain a tailwind. In memory, even with some customers’ investment signaled to slow, demand diversification remains strong across multiple other industries. Second, our wafer inspection business again delivered impressive results in the June quarter as revenues grew 20% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Third, KLA delivered record quarterly revenue from our electronics, packaging and components business in the June quarter. Fourth, the KLA service business surpassed the $0.5 billion quarterly revenue level for the first time as revenue was $512 million, up 15% year-over-year.
Finally, the June quarter was another exceptional period from the perspective of free cash flow and capital returns. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $746 million amounting to 23% year-over-year growth. We also announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend level. Additionally, we increased our long-term targeted capital returns to 85% of free cash flow. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders versus via our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Also, this quarter, we introduced our new long-term revenue growth targets and financial model for 2026 at our June 16, 2022 Investor Day in New York City. KLA’s new 9% to 11% revenue growth objective through ‘26 features strong relative growth in each of our major business lines over that period. Our long-term model assumes the baseline semiconductor industry growth CAGR of 6% to 7% through 2026, with many forecasts today for the semiconductor market to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.
In summary, KLA’s June quarter results once again demonstrate sustainable outperformance. Our consistent execution against various challenges in the marketplace both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and in addressing persistent supply chain issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global team and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.
Chief Financial Officer, Bren Higgins, will now go through our June quarter financial highlights and outlook. Bren? Thank you, Rick. As Rick has said, KLA’s June quarter results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. Revenue was near $2.5 billion, non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS and GAAP EPS were $5.81 and $5.40 respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, below our expectation of $525 million mostly due to the timing of new employees joining versus our plan. In addition, we also realized a cost benefit from the strong U.S. dollar impact resulting from our global footprint.
Total operating expenses comprised $297 million in R&D and $217 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect to continue our important investment in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the leverageable KLA operating model to facilitate growth.
Our investments include new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $530 million in the September quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to continue to trend higher over the balance of 2022 to support our sequential revenue growth expectations. We will size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon.
Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 41.8%, almost 1 point higher than the guidance midpoint implied. Other income and expense net was $22 million, below guidance of $43 million, with the positive variance from guidance reflecting a gain on a strategic investment that was transacted in the quarter offset by a recurring mark-to-market adjustment of the supply investment.
For the September quarter, we forecasted at approximately $75 million to reflect the impact of the new debt issuance. Quarterly effective tax rate was 14.8% higher than the 13.5% guidance due principally to the equity market impact on deferred compensation programs. At the guided rate, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.09 higher at $5.90. We continue to guide 13.5% is a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $867 million. GAAP net income was $805 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $746 million resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 86% and a free cash flow margin of 30%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Moving to the balance sheet, where we saw a lot of activity this past quarter. KLA ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In June, S&P upgraded KLA 1 notch to A- citing improved scale and outlook for further profitable growth. Later in June, we issued $3 billion in new debt and announced the completion of a tender offer for $500 million of senior notes due 2024. These actions reinforce the KLA maintained active and diligent oversight of our cost of capital and awareness of the impact on shareholder value of the appropriate capital structure for our business and productive capital allocation.
As demonstrated by the new calendar 2026 financial targets and the capital return actions announced at our recent Investor Day, KLA has confidence in our business over the long-term and is committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns that includes both dividend growth, increasing share repurchases. Consistent with this, we increased our long-term capital returns target, as mentioned earlier. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.9 billion in share repurchases and $639 million in dividends paid.
Turning to our outlook, we have adjusted our overall WFE outlook for calendar ‘22 to reflect persistent supply chain challenges that are gaining shipments and revenue recognition for many of our peers. We now expect the WFE market to grow in the high single-digits to approximately $95 billion in 2022 off a baseline of roughly $87 billion in calendar 2021. This outlook reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across customer segments. While we work hard to manage capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.
While our supplier engagement strategy, as we discussed at our Investor Day, has been validated through this cycle, supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. As indicated in the last couple of quarters, we continue to expect sequential growth through this calendar year and expect KLA’s total revenue growth to meet or exceed the low 20% range. The semiconductor process control systems growing several points faster than the company average.
Finally, we expect demand to continue exceeding supply during the calendar year’s second half. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our semi PC business, which should translate to strong relative growth overall. Looking ahead, as indicated earlier, we are concerned with the macroeconomic environment and how they affect the demand for our customers’ products and their capacity plans as we move into calendar 2023. Today, the pressure from customers to deliver remains high and is driving our expectations for sequential growth through calendar 2022. We are encouraged by the diversification and sustainability of our current demand profile and the company’s operational execution. We are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support our customers’ growing process control requirements our near-term outlook and our long-term through-cycle growth thesis.
Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 64%, and memory is expected to be around 36% of semi PC systems revenue. In memory, DRAM is expected to be about 40% of the segment mix and NAND, 60%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.28 to $6.38 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.70 to $6.80. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 143 million shares.
In conclusion, despite the macro and supply chain headwinds, see the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE is both durable and compelling over the long run. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends in our industry. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and the resumption of scaling reflects the value that semiconductors in our industry have on lowering our cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.
When it comes to KLA, considering our track record of execution and the power of our portfolio, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable outperformance throughout changing economic periods. As we look at the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, we continue to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook and maintain our product development investments to enable industry growth and support our customers’ multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution position us to continue outperforming our industry as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive mode, industry-leading financial performance. long-standing track record of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. I’ll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Thank you, Bren. We are ready to queue for questions. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results and quarterly execution. You guys lead times are quite long, but you guys have good visibility into next year. And I think even into, in some cases, 2024, you highlighted some of the demand headwinds in your prepared remarks and also maybe some of the early signals from your customers on there is sort of conservative CapEx spending plans going forward. I know you’re not seeing anything meaningful in terms of near to midterm shipment plans, but given your customers are all looking into next year, have you guys seen any changes in longer-term orders as a result of your customers’ increasingly negative views on demand for next year? Yes. Harlan, thanks for the comments and the question. I would say that certainly in the near-term, we’ve seen no changes from our customers. In fact, the pressure is as high today as it was 3 months ago. And our adjustments to the near-term WFE were really related to some of the challenges that a lot of our peer companies are facing in terms of their ability to either ship tools or recognize revenue, and that would have an impact on WFE given the expectations for the second half – in terms of growth in the second half versus the first half. It’s too early for us to call ‘23. Certainly, we’re monitoring what we see there. As we think about our planning and as we move into – as we move outside of this year from – at least from where we sit today, we see a sustainability in our output levels as we move into the first part of ‘23. Now we will have to watch and see what our customers end up doing and particularly some of the challenges in the memory space and what that might mean. But at least from where we sit today, we see no real churn in the backlog and in expectations in terms of delivery timing. Yes, even to add to that, Harlan, one of the things we have seen because obviously, we’ve been talking with customers recently and they are – they know we’re aware of some of the talk is that they are telling us basically two things. One, keep our slots. And two, if somebody else’s spot opens up, could you please give it to us. So what we’re seeing for process control, feel like we’re probably a little bit in a different position than the process players are. Great. And in the event of WFE decline next year. You’ve got several positive buffers, right? And I feel like one of the biggest ones is that your services business historically does not decline during downturn. So like if I look back over the past 20 years, I think there is only been 1 year that your services business has been down. And then more near-term, I think over the past four downturns, the KLA team has actually grown its services business in all four of those downturns. So outside of the stable annuity-like subscription service contracts, and I know you guys talked about expansion on services opportunities on legacy nodes like – what else has allowed the team to grow its services business in periods where WFE spending is weak? And what’s the historical track record on the ETC services business during downturns? So kind of two questions you threw in the EPC one at the end. Let me start with the process control one. Often what we’ve seen historically in downturn is customers still want to get productivity. And one of the ways they do that as they focus heavily on yield improvement or process stability. So we actually see utilization stay high on the services in order to keep the tools capable. And sometimes they will actually deploy some of their limited budget toward upgrading the installed base. In terms of EPC, obviously, we’ve not really been through a cycle with that. So it’s a little bit secondhand knowledge. But it depends on the segment that they are in, in terms of – but as you know, as a percent of our overall business, that will not change the dynamic that we see overall for our services – should we hit some headwinds going into next year? The only other thing I’d add, Harlan, is that we’re seeing investment across multiple nodes. And so from a leading edge point of view, certainly, the complexity of the tools that are going in to support those markets, the drivers of those markets particularly around data center and high-performance compute will drive our customers to given how they buy process control to want to keep these tools up and use them as they are trying to navigate through these technology transitions. And so that’s an important aspect of the value that we add. So even if they are pulling back on some of the capacity investments they might be making, they are still investing in R&D and ramping facilities. And the wafer start goals within a particular time frame may just change. If you think about within memory or even within some of the trailing edge areas, those areas are areas where process control intensity tends to be a little bit lower. And so I think just in terms of how we see the investment play out, those are areas that we’re less exposed to it I don’t think that they would impact the business to the degree that they might impact other more capacity-centric players. Great. Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Your line is open. This is [indiscernible] on for Krish. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question was just around if you could provide any color on a potential impact to the business in terms of shipments to China, if there were any sort of restrictions what this might look like, whether pool Pacific or based on tax base sub 14-nanometer shipments, just sort of how you’re thinking about that? And then I have one follow-up. Well, specific to that question. And of course, there was some – I know some of our peers have gotten this question as well. But we did receive a notification from the U.S. government about new licensing requirements for China related to sub-14-nanometer development and production. Of course, we will continue to engage with the government and have an active dialogue and we will fully comply with all applicable laws in guidance here. I would say that given the lead time and timing unpredictability of new licenses, that this has no effect on our guidance for the upcoming quarter, our comments on the remainder of ‘22. And I would say, as I look at the funnel over the next 12 months, given where investment is happening and what we expect, we don’t see any material impact to our business from this new requirement. So I don’t want to speculate on what else could happen. But based on what we know today and what we’ve been asked, that’s mostly what I have to say about the topic. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just real quick, have you provided in the past, the breakdown between domestic and international shipments to China if I remember correctly, maybe you mentioned domestic customers for more skewed towards smaller foundry players, is that a fair assumption? Yes. That’s still true. The multinational activity in China is more mature. And so most of our business is in China, it tends to be native China as it relates to semiconductor process control. So within semiconductor process control systems, about 25% or so of our shipments are to China. And now overall, for the whole company, as you service and you include other parts of the company, EPC and so on, you end up closer to in this last quarter, it was 29%. Most – so most of the business is there and most of it is across multiple projects. There is a lot of projects. They tend to be more foundry logic. You also have investment in infrastructure related to reticle infrastructure and wafer infrastructure. And so there is investments that are happening there, and we have products that serve those parts of the market as well. Great. Thank you. That’s all for me. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you – Bren, if you go through kind of the puts and takes on gross margin this quarter and how we should think about cost pass through this quarter and what’s embedded in the guidance? It pretty much played out the way we expected. We had more EPC revenue quarter-to-quarter as we had a record quarter in EPC, and that was a little dilutive from a mix point of view. Certainly, the challenges related to supply chain and what that means in terms of factory efficiency is also a bit of a drag on our margins. But we had modeled that in for the most part. And I think the guidance midpoint was 62.5%, and we were at 62.4%. So pretty much as we had expected. As we look at the September quarter, most of the growth is coming from our – in fact, all the growth and then a little bit because I would expect EPC to be down some quarter-on-quarter. It is coming from semi PC, it’s a richer mix. And so we will see that go up about 50 basis points or so at the midpoint. We are seeing pressure from cost increase, both in terms of parts, but also in terms of freight and logistics, and I think that’s taking away some of the – what you would expect to see in terms of incremental leverage in an expanding revenue environment like we are in. So, it’s offsetting some of those benefits, but at the end of the day, we felt like we would be operating somewhere around 63% through this year, and that’s been the guidance I have been giving and we are for the most part, in line with that. That’s very helpful. And then maybe I missed it, but what was the mix of DRAM versus NAND for this quarter? I know you did it for the September quarter guide. Yes. So, 45% was memory, and the mix was two-thirds DRAM. Perfect. Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe first off, in terms of leading edge versus trailing edge foundry logic, obviously, I think a lot of your leading edge customers are still powering to with their investment plan. It’s more the question of timing of when they can get tools. Can you characterize what you are seeing on the trailing edge given that there is a lot of noise around that? Have you seen any changes in that marketplace, or are investment plans at that device marketplace still on track on a going-forward basis? Sure. And yes, you are right. The leading edge guys are continuing and we don’t expect in our conversations with them, we don’t expect any change in that. In terms of the trailing edge, it’s not really been a big part of our business. And as we look forward, we are still struggling with demand – with supply for some of them. And so actually, the conversations we have been having have been more about them asking if they could accelerate deliveries than changing the profile. So, given the conversations we have had and their desire to upgrade their facilities, it’s not really a change in our profile. It may soften, but it hasn’t yet. And in fact, if anything, comment I made earlier, people are asking if spot open up, could they get access to them, and that’s really been more of the conversation that we have been having because some of the products that they need, especially in the trailing edge, tend to be BVP kind of oriented products where we have tremendous demand. Yes. And the other thing I would add is about 80% of the revenue tends to be leading edge. So, where we are selling to the trailing edge, you do have customers that are strategically trying to in-source more, so they are making more investments and longer term investments. And as specifications for end products are changing that could change process control requirements. But generally, if they are just expanding capacity to run parts that they have been running for a long time that are just inflecting as a result of the strong demand environment, you don’t see real significant changes in process control intensity, they just add their process control equipment as they are expanding the wafer starts in a particular facility. So, that drives the process control intensity that’s fairly light. Now over time, that’s I think what’s happening in the end markets is creating some opportunities for us. But it’s less of an impact in terms of the financial or the revenue contribution from those customers to KLA. It’s great revenue, and it’s profitable revenue given that we are selling older platforms or platforms that we have been able to extend into those markets. But the big driver for our business is much more around leading edge than what we are seeing in the trailing edge. Great. That’s really helpful. And Bren, maybe as a quick follow-up question for you. You guys have done a really good job of managing through the supply chain issue that the industry and the ecosystem is seeing, the costs are obviously elevated, whether it’s freight and logistics, the movement of components and things of that nature. How do you look at the cost environment over the next several quarters. Is this something that we are just going to have to assume at least through the rest of ‘22 and possibly into ’23? Yes, it’s a good question. And of course, everything is more expensive. And so we are seeing that flow through earlier than prior quarters, maybe the last quarter, the quarter before, I talked about this year, expecting to see 100 basis point kind of impact, one point or so from incremental cost increase. And if you add freight into it, it’s probably a little bit higher than that. And so we are seeing that play through. Generally, when prices go up, they don’t necessarily go down. And so we are not really planning on it. And we will have to – as I said at Investor Day, there is work for us to do in terms of how we think about doing this [ph] overall. Our products, generally, we are a value sell and so we think about the returns our customers are getting from our products, and we try to share in the value of that return. And part of our new capability cadence in terms of how we offer that to the market, managing not only new capability from a competitive point of view is important to that, but also what it means to financial model in terms of an opportunity for us to reassess the cost situation in a particular tool and how cost of ownership plays out in terms of the improvements that we are offering and how we will share that. So, we are being opportunistic where we can. Certainly, we are not benefiting from the revenue expansion from a scale point of view. And so we are not giving discounts related purely to volume to the extent that we have in the past. And so we are resetting some of that with our customers. But in general, I think it’s much more about the value offering and how things – kind of how things are priced over time. Great. Thank you again. We will take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had a question on CHIPS Act and I understand it’s early. It looks like equipment companies might be able to get money to expand manufacturing of equipment in the U.S. with priority going first two companies that already manufacture in the U.S., and I understand you guys have manufacturing both the inside the U.S. and outside and how would this change, if at all, your long-term manufacturing strategy? Thanks for the question. It doesn’t really change our strategy. We are not going to make decisions based on that. we are going to make decisions as we always have, based on where it makes the most sense for us to build the products to support our customers where we can get the talent and where we can have the supply chains that we need. So, it will not impact our decision making. You all have our assets that were fairly asset-light. So, to the extent that we are building or expanding our facilities anywhere, it’s really about space more than anything and some equipment. So, it isn’t – it’s very different than what our customers in terms of significant billions of dollars investment in a production facility. So, to Rick’s point, it’s much more about the operational motives that we have in terms of why we build, what we build where. And incentives, whether they come in the form of grants, they come in the form of taxes or secondary. Obviously, we always optimize for wherever we are, but the primary motive is very operational for us. Great. As my follow-up, Bren, 19 years ago, you were talking about EPC systems growing 20% for the year, and I understand June was a record quarter. Are you still looking at 20% growth for the EPC systems for the full year? And how are you – what are you seeing in the Mobile segment versus the Auto segment of that end market? Yes. That’s a great question. Auto is continues to be strong, auto and power, but we have seen some pressure, particularly in the PCB part of the business, driven by the softness in the mobile market. I would expect EPC systems to be in the mid-teens in terms of growth this year, a little bit stronger in the second half versus the first half just as the whole company is a little bit stronger. But yes, it’s mostly been – we have seen strength and improvement in SPTS, our specialty semiconductor given its exposure to automotive and power, but we have seen some softness on the PCB side. So, net-net, still nice growth, mid-teens growth, but not 20%. Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our final question from Vedvati Shrotre of Jefferies. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on something that was asked earlier. So, you mentioned that your customers are sort of looking for slots in case any opens up. So, can you help me understand how that works? So, if you get a push out from your customer, does that mean that slot is sort of close and the customer has to go back in the line? Is that a right interpretation? Yes. So, I think our customers have the same kind of question you do. It doesn’t really work that way. I mean what they really want to do is move up the priority list. But as we keep explaining to them, we have far more demand, then we have supply, and while we are working hard to expand it. So, it’s just the question of can we get things done sooner, and that’s really what they are asking is can you tell. But my point is that is for many customers, the way they are approaching this, they are hopeful that this will give them a chance to get some of the products that are pretty far out in delivery. That’s kind of the way to think about it. It’s not really exactly the same. We do have allocations for people, but they are just aren’t no free slots. So, if somebody were to drop out of the queue, the next person would just move up in terms of the way that would work. So, it’s not – people aren’t going to jump ahead in the line. Right. And so if I understand correctly, so if – in case if there is a push-out and not a cancellation, does that necessarily open up a slot or a push-out kind of different from… So, if somebody had a December slot right now, and they said, we don’t need that until June. The next person in line in December would get that slot, and they would be fit in somewhere in June. And they are likely our customers that have slots in June that would love to have a slot in December. So, given the lead times on some of our products. So, that’s the natural churn we see. And a lot of it is tied to sometimes facilities and facility readiness. It also can be tied to whether they received certain tools from other customers as they are setting up or other suppliers as they are setting up their production lines. So, you always see a little bit of movement like that. But to Rick’s point, we are under-serving the level of demand we have. And so customers are having to get in line a long way out in a lot of cases. And so the ability to satisfy that demand earlier would be an opportunity for a lot of our customers that they would certainly want to take advantage of given the strength of the demand that they have seen, but also their desire for these products and our constraints around them. Got it. Thank you very much. That’s very helpful. Thank you and thank you everyone for joining us. We know how busy of a day it is today in terms of earnings. So, I appreciate your time and interest.

Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some brief quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment, including our business in China. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend some time sharing highlights of KLA's performance in the quarter, touch on our business in China and provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment.
Before we get into details, I'd like to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who have continued to demonstrate perseverance in navigating dynamic challenges to deliver for our customers. Their commitment is evident in our results. KLA's September quarter demonstrate strong customer demand across major product groups. Specifically for this quarter, record revenue of $2.7 billion was at the top of the guidance range, growing 31% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped $1 billion for the first time. GAAP earnings per share was $7.20 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.06, each above guidance ranges.
Our performance is a reflection of the increasingly essential role process control plays in the development of enabling technology and the long-term product road maps of our customers. As drivers for semiconductor demand continue to diversify beyond traditional PC and consumer facing markets, process control is considered critical in enabling customers to execute on node and technology transitions.
As this demand backdrop continues to evolve, our KLA operating model ensures focus on delivering for our customers, navigating supply chain challenges and continued investment in R&D.
Now, I will quickly summarize key highlights for the quarter. First, KLA continues to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers and is positioned to be one of the fastest-growing Tier 1 WFE equipment suppliers in calendar 2022, substantially outperforming expected overall WFE market growth.
Second, our patterning systems revenue grew 49% sequentially and 67% on a year-over-year basis.
Third, KLA delivered strong quarterly revenue in our SPTS segment. KLA has intensified efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolios of both, the semiconductor process control and EPC groups.
Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $529 million in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year.
Finally, operating cash flow topped $1 billion for the first time, and we generated quarterly free cash flow of $927 million and free cash flow margin of 34% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, total free cash flow grew from 37% to $3.14 billion.
Total capital returns in the quarter were $278 million, comprising $90 million in share repurchases and $188 million in dividends paid. Total capital returns over 12 months ended September 30th were $5.2 billion or 166% of free cash flow and included $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends.
Early in October, the US government issued new regulations to control aspects of the US semiconductor industry trade with China. Specific to KLA, a meaningful amount of our business in China is focused on legacy node investment, which is not the focus of the recent export restrictions.
However, our system and service revenue will be adversely impacted going forward as we are unable to provide systems and support to certain customers for certain end uses. We are assessing the broader implications and engaging collaboratively with the US government to provide the necessary information about our products and services to fully determine the impact on our business operations moving forward.
As we look at the industry demand environment, growth for the semiconductor industry has evolved to be more strategic with more diverse end market mix. For the near-term, the recognized excess inventories driven by a slowdown in consumer electronics markets, such as PC and mobility is having an impact on semiconductor device pricing, particularly in memory.
As a result, semiconductor customers are adjusting CY 2023 CapEx budgets lower with the largest impact to date coming from memory customers. However, long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry continues due to the prioritization of R&D investment at the leading edge, continued investment in legacy nodes and growth in enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. Considering all factors, KLA's long-term targets announced at our Investor Day in June remain intact.
In summary, KLA September quarter's results demonstrate sustainable outperformance and highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our teams continue to navigate and execute against dynamic challenges, and KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio to meet evolving customer requirements.
The KLA operating model and our strategic objectives are the foundation for our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, strong free cash flow generation, and consistent returns to shareholders.
Now our CFO, Bren Higgins, will review our September quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Bren? Thank you. As you heard from Rick, KLA's September quarter results were strong, better than expected and demonstrated our consistent successful execution. While supply chain challenges continue in certain areas and are still limiting output, we have seen marginal improvement as new supplier capacity has come online to meet our requirements.
Our continued focus on meeting customer needs, while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading growth and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful.
Quarterly revenue was $2.724 billion, at the top of the guided range of $2.475 billion to $2.725 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.06, above the guided range of $5.70 to $6.8 0.
GAAP diluted EPS was $7.20. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40 basis points, above the midpoint of guidance at 63.4% at semiconductor process control systems, which carry stronger gross margins delivered virtually all the revenue upside from the guidance midpoint.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $526 million, slightly below our expectation of $530 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 44.1%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped the $1 billion level for the first time ever. GAAP net income was $1.03 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion. And free cash flow was $927 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% and a free cash flow margin of 34%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with almost $3 billion in total cash, debt of $6.3 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. Our balance sheet offers a unique capability to fund our growth strategies, both organic and inorganic, and providing ongoing attractive capital returns to shareholders.
Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends paid with total capital returns amounting to 166% of free cash flow.
Turning to our outlook. KLA continues to deliver sequential growth and strong relative financial performance. Based on the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, KLA is positioned for mid-28% revenue growth for the total company in calendar 2022, with semiconductor process control systems growing several points faster than the company average.
Furthermore, this business is expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE industry growth, which is currently projected to be up mid-to high single digits to the low $90 billion range.
Looking ahead, we expect industry spending to slow. Though early, we are planning our business based on the expectation of CY 2023 WFE declining approximately 20% based on increasing global macroeconomic concerns and recent public statements from several customers, particularly in memory, and the impact of the new US government regulations on native China investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows.
In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market.
Specific to KLA, we are still assessing the impact of the new China export regulations. Our preliminary assessment for the combined gross direct impact on our revenue based on our existing backlog and sales funnel forecast is in the range of approximately $600 million to $900 million in calendar 2023. This reflects systems and service impact with service representing approximately 10% to 15% of the total. This estimate is before any potential system reallocation for products where supply is meaningfully below current demand, which has resulted in significant lead time to other customers.
Given our backlog and forecast, we expect that we will be able to reallocate certain tools to other customers as we move through next year. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition is focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of business environment. While capacity plans can change, technology road map investment tends to be more resilient. This adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements.
In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.
Our December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion, plus or minus $150 million. The gross direct impact of the new China regulations on the December quarter revenue guidance is approximately $100 million.
Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and memory is expected to be around 24% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 55% of the segment mix and NAND 45%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5%, due primarily to expected product and segment mix.
Looking ahead, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives with the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, operating expenses will grow to approximately $550 million in the December quarter, with growth in quarterly operating expenses expected to flatten out as we move through calendar 2023.
Other model assumptions for the December quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $66 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.94 to $7.34 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.30 to $7.70. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 140 million shares.
In conclusion, although the CY 2023 outlook for WFE demand has softened, we remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors are playing an influencing national industrial policy, and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain important trends.
These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers, and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.
For KLA, considering our strong track record of execution and the power of our portfolio strategy, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable relative outperformance. We will continue to maintain a high level of investment in our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion and support customer’s technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.
This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us to continue to deliver strong relative performance as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, industry leading financial performance, history of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? Thanks, Bren. Operator, can you please queue for questions? [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. As you mentioned, the team has been outperforming WFE and process control spending growth for the last few years. No different this year. I mean, it looks like given your December quarter guidance, your process control systems business is going to be up 30% to 35% when WFE is only up high single digits. I know in the last downturn, 2019, not as severe, but as potentially 2023 is, but you guys actually grew your process control and services revenues when WFE was down back then. So given all of this, do you think guys just provide some rough framework for thinking about the team's revenue and earnings power potential with industry spending down about 20% next year? Yeah, Harlan. It's Bren. Thank you for the comments, and I'll start here, and Rick can join after. So I think the way to think about KLA performance is typically, historically, most of the volatility we've seen in WFE has been in the memory space. And as you know, process control intensity and memory is quite a bit lower than it is in foundry and logic.
So I think you have to go back a couple of decades. I think we've outperformed WFE in a down year that WFE has had. So I think that that's always been an anchor for us. We also tend to support customers that are investing in their roadmaps. So as they pull back on their capacity investments, they continue to invest in technology, and so there's a certain amount of business that -- with KLA that continues to happen almost irrespective of their revenue levels. So that tends to be a factor for us as well.
And then finally, customers usually continue to run the installed base, and so service is – continues to operate. We have a contract strain that is the majority of the revenue, 75% plus of the revenue. And so while they're pulling back on CapEx investments, they still tend to run the installed bases pretty heavily. And given how they buy process control generally in terms of buying what they need and rely on us to maximize uptime for those systems that it tends to also be an anchor as we move through down periods in the CapEx environment. Great. Thanks for that. And then on my follow-up, good to see the strong EUV mask inspection shipments. Your Patterning segment was up almost 70% every year. I think that's reflective of the strong EUV adoption this year. And despite the weaker WFE backdrop for next year, I think that the EUV lithography outlook continues to be strong, right? I mean, continued penetration of EUV into memory and logic and foundry. And so this should bode well or continue to bode well for your mask inspection demand. But I know last year, the mask inspection segment underperformed positive control on growth. What's the team's outlook for your mass construction business this year and next year, given the relatively better fundamental outlook in lithography? So yeah, Harlan, you have it right. So this year is actually a very strong year for reticle inspection. I would expect reticle inspection to outperform the overall semi PC business within the company. So a very strong year and certainly driven by EUV as 90% plus of EUV reticles and production are running through KLA systems.
As we look at next year, I think that there will be continued demand there as you see the – start to see more investment in the 3-nanometer node. So I would expect the rapid business to probably continue to perform better than semi PC. There's also some investment in infrastructure that's happening in some of the legacy mask inspection and new infrastructure that's being built in China to support the legacy reticles, and so there's also an aspect of investment that's happening there as well. So I would expect it to have another good year this year, our strong year in 2022, but also a strong year 2023 as well. Yeah. And one other thing, Harlan that I think that -- one of the things that contributed to our strength is share gain due to new capabilities on our products. So part of what we were in development for was continuing extending the 6xx product to be able to serve more of the EUV market. So as we do that, we saw some performance. So overall, the segment is good, and then we had some -- the benefit of some share gain as well. That's insightful. Thank you. We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Rick, just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question. I understand you guys typically outperform process control like a normal cyclical downturn. But if you overlay the fact that some of your peers had supply issues, which you posted not, and process control tends to be more early cyclical. If you overlay those two companies, do you still expect your process control revenue to outperform WFE next year? And then I have a follow-up. We do for two reasons. One, it's true that some of them had more challenges than we did, but we had our own. We could have shipped – we built backlog, we could have shipped more if we had more capacity. But the other thing is the decline in WFE is going to be based more in memory than in foundry logic. So that alone helps us in terms of the mix. So I think we're in pretty good position to outperform WFE. Nobody really knows, of course, what 2023 is going to look like. But with that set-up, we're in pretty good shape. Got it, got it. Very helpful, Rick. And then just a follow-up on services. What percentage of your services is from China or domestic China? And also if WFE is down 20%, what do you think happens to service business next year? Thank you. Yeah. I don't think we've broken that out. I would say it's less than -- if our systems business in China and semi PC is somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would expect the service stream is less, because it's less developed. It's newer in terms of the investment that's happened, and so it would be lower than as a mix of service revenue, that is a mix of consistent revenue.
I would expect service to continue to grow next year. I think it will be below the -- in that WFE environment, it'd be below what our long-term growth rate target of 12% to 14%. I think it'll probably be somewhere in single digits. There is a little bit of an FX headwind that happens to service as you have the strong dollar, but you have a lot of service revenues denominated in local currencies. You don't have natural hedge, because you also have cost denominated as well. But there is a little bit of a headwind that's coming on service revenue growth from FX. But I think we'll probably be somewhere in mid to high single-digit service growth given expectations of WFE that are down 20%. Krish, when we set the 2026 plan at our Investor Day, we didn't know when, but we anticipated there'd be this digestion period of WFE just based on the historic growth, so we're still modeling the targets that we set out for 2026. And we didn't know when, but it seems like it's coming in 2023, and we weren't sure if it was 2023 or 2024, but it was going to be in that period.
But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are positioned relative to that longer term trend line. And as Bren said, we'll go under it, but then we've got a lot of systems that are shipping now, for example, that will come off warranty. And so they'll be going into services as we move forward, and so we feel pretty good about where we are relative to the long-term services plan. Got it. Thank Rick. Thanks Bren. Very helpful. We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak to changes in backlog over the last three months, how you're incorporating the changes around domestic China embargo. And when are you expecting to get back to your normalized lead times of six to seven months? Yeah, C.J., it's a good question. And we'll have the specific numbers in the 10-Q, which we'll likely file on -- probably by the end of this week. But we did grow backlog a little bit. So remaining performance obligations will be somewhere in the mid-13 range, so some modest growth of 13.1 as a reference point in the June quarter. We did scrub a little bit of the backlog given the new China regulations. I think there's more work to be done there as we move into the December quarter. It's still fairly fluid, and we're working through our own assessment of the new regulations and engaging with the government about how to think about certain situations there. So I would expect to see a little bit come out. Certainly, we grew it a little bit this quarter, and I expect a little bit more effort or a little bit more there as we move into the December quarter. So I think from a lead time point of view, it's been a very cross certain products. So we have certain products that are high-end sort of technology-enabling products like broadband plasma inspection, our retinal inspection tools, our Voyager laser scanning system, SD7-SeRscan products. Those lead times remain very extended. I think it will take some time because we're dependent on incremental capacity to come online to be able to work through some of that backlog. And I would expect those customers to stay in the queue given the long-term sort of demand dynamics around that – those particular products.
But as it relates to some of our more capacity-centric products, I would expect some normalization as we move into 2023. I think certainly, we're still constrained today in a lot of areas, and I would expect that we'll see that continue for a little while. But I think as we move through '23, we'll get up with a little bit more flexibility and more normalization on certain more capacity-centric product. Very, very helpful. As a quick follow-up, I think you talked about $100 million of gross risk related to the China impact for December. And I guess what does the net number look like there? I mean, should we just be pulling out kind of $10 million to $15 million from service to reflect that and that you're perhaps repurposing the remaining tools so the net effect is much less, or how should we think about that? Yes, I think the easiest way to think about it approximately -- without the new regulations, our guidance would have been approximately $100 million higher, right? I think the mix that I talked about earlier in terms of service versus system is about the same in this quarter versus the longer term. And the ability to reallocate those systems in the short run a little bit harder. So I think that as we move into next year, we'll – I think we'll be able to reallocate more, including some of what we expected here. But I think in the shorter run, much harder for us to do. So I think the easiest way to think about it is the way I described it. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. Just one more on China. Can you help us put this $600 million to $900 million in context with what you're currently doing. In the last 12 months, China sales were about $2.8 billion. Obviously, it's both domestic and multi. So is this 600 to 900 million de-risked enough? And how much is left and what is left once the $600 million to $900 million goes out of your addressable opportunity next year? Yeah, It's I think it's de-risked. We try to provide a range to give you some perspective. Certainly, there's some forecast that's part of that. But as we looked at what we have in backlog and we looked at what we expect to book over the course of 2023 for the affected customers, we were able to go tool by tool to come up with the range that I provided. And service is roughly 10% to 15% of that.
We will see as we move forward. Again, we're at a very preliminary stage in terms of working through the regulations and also engaging with customers. There's the possibility that, that we're able to get some of that back as we move forward, but we'll have to see how that plays out.
As I said in the prepared remarks, it is tied to the legacy parts of our business, which are really unaffected by the new regulations. Most of what was considered 14-nanometer and below was already de-risked from our plans because we were dealing with similar guidance back in the June quarter. And so what – the biggest part of the change was the restrictions on the memory business. And so I think we feel pretty good about the range given where we are, the range we provided. Okay. And just as a follow-up, I had a longer term more conceptual question. I know we are far away from 2024. But as people look forward and especially this topic of WFE intensity, in the last two years, it grows about 15% to 16%. But before that, the industry used to be around the 13%, 14% level. Do you think as the industry recovers, we stay at the 13%, 14%, or do you think there's a case to be made that WFE intensity can start to recover back to the levels that we have seen in the last two years? Yeah. I mean, when we look at the longer term, and it's a great question. And actually, that's the one that I think is the one that we've been spending a lot of time thinking about.
The intensity is related to a couple of factors, obviously, but one of them is the challenge with the advanced technology nodes associated with it. And I think part of why it went back up was that scaling resumed, and scaling has resumed both in what we've seen in logic/foundry but also in memory.
So I do think it is going to trend slightly higher than it was, and that it will be in 2019 or 2023, but it will go back up. Whether it goes all the way back up, it's not exactly clear, but I do think there's going to be pressure on that for people, everybody that's trying to move forward in technology.
And the one thing that we know will happen during 2023 even if there's a slowdown in capacity, there won't be a slowdown in technology advancement because everybody knows the way you get out of a downturn is by having newer products. So I think it does trend back up. Whether it goes back all the way, we'll wait and see. But I think there's some improvement in capital intensity, and then we're on the strong belief that process control intensity will hold on to some of the gains that we've made and potentially build on them as we bring new products in. Yeah. Fundamental to our thesis was that we would see semiconductor revenue grow, and WFE would grow slightly faster. So you'd have a flat to up trend line in WFE intensity that would be faster than semiconductor revenue, predicated on the things that Rick talked about, but also that a lot of the dynamics in the industry that drove significant efficiency in WFE have been worked out of the system. And what I mean by that is things like wafer transitions or normal wafer transitions, the consolidation that we saw in the industry and so on as some of the bigger factors.
So our view is, is that there will be a lot of pressure for customers to try to keep it from growing, but that we were growing faster than it is. But most of what is talked about today from customers is to keep it from growing faster, not to keep it from -- to drive it down. And so I think that there's -- we think the long-term assumption that's there is, I think, a fairly straight down the middle assumption in terms of how we think about long-term. Yeah. And just one additional fact. When you look at the regionalization efforts and you think about new fabs around the world, they will tend to be slightly less efficient, which will drive up the efficiency, and those numbers are not really in anything in calendar 2023. Thanks very much. We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the export restrictions. You guys have talked about seeing the logic restrictions coming, I think, before, and I heard from anyone else. Where were you surprised on the logic side?
And then as a bigger picture question. The fact that this could affect the multinationals, but the multinationals immediately have a license for a year, do you think that gives any kind of pause to investing in Chinese fabs for the multinationals, who could find themselves with large assets that they're unable to upgrade if there's a change in policy? Just can you kind of assess how your customers are talking about all of this? Yes, Joe, this is not an area where we're going to provide much insight. I think from the standpoint, I think what you meant is that we see the memory restrictions coming, right, because we talked about the logic ones. We were not surprised by the export controls that were implemented and as we've mentioned, we've been working with the government officials as they've implemented those. So we're not surprised by that.
When I talk to customers about their plans in China, I think a lot of what they're doing is trying to figure out what are the implications of those extensions and what's the long-term viability. So, I would say that it's a much better question to ask them than us. And ultimately from our standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter that much because if they choose not to invest there, what they're doing is investing to support demand and they'll move that investment to where they could do it.
So that's kind of the way they're talking about it and what we're seeing. So, I think from our standpoint, a lot of the – now that this has happened, we're in a much better position to not speculate, but support as we move forward. Thank you very much. We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Last quarter, you had talked about productivity, your manufacturing staying relatively similar rates in the second half into the first half of next year. Is that still how you're thinking about it? And maybe in that context, how do you think about that relative to gross margin? Yes. Look, we -- as you see in the guidance, right, we have another step-up in output expectations out of the factories and are still driving to deliver into the first part of the year. I mean, certainly, there's been some customer churn that we've seen. Most of our sort of adjustments to our outlook are more from a top-down perspective in terms of engagement with certain customers and also public information. I think we'll have to see how it plays through.
But right now, we are driving the factories to continue to deliver against what our customers have asked us for. So, I think we'll have to see how it plays out, but we start to see some rescheduling as we move into '23. I think those are still questions out there, given just the dynamics we're seeing on the macro front and what we're hearing from customers. But for now, I think our view on the first part is somewhat consistent with what I've said in the past. But I'll have more to say about half to half in the March guidance when we get there. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Maybe going back to the Investor Day. Now with the new China export restrictions and wanting some of the emerging China customers, how do you think about that maybe changing the long-term growth CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day in terms of WFE, your capital intensity? Does it change given those guys are maybe trying to ramp up on the technology front and so spending a little bit more than say some of the more mature customers? Well, it really goes back to the -- it's a good question, and we had contemplated a rationalization of WFE in support of the overall industry. So that's really how I think about that is that, ultimately, there – most of our customers end up having pretty strict investment forecast based on their belief of the capital intensity that they can afford.
And you aggregate that up to the industry, and it kind of goes back to well, what are your assumptions about semiconductor industry growth? What are your assumptions about capital intensity and what are your assumptions about process control. Those are all in the band of what we considered when we looked at the investment that was going to happen there.
So yes, it may be that there was some investment without the revenue to support it. But eventually, it was going to get rationalized and then we go back to believe in the semiconductor industry growth. You believe in, overall, the question we answered earlier on capital intensity. So its pretty much based in the number. The reason we set it out for '26 instead of sooner was, as I mentioned before, we felt like there was going to be kind of digestion period, which we're now facing into, so you kind of get there.
As I mentioned, there will be some investment that when you look at some of this regionalization that hasn't happened yet that would have been upside to that plan and now I think you end up it kind of all blends together. So if you believe the semiconductor growth, I don't think capital intensity goes down, and we feel pretty good about process control and our share, that's supportive of the numbers that we laid out. In addition, Bren already talked about the services, which is another big part of it. So a very long way to say we feel like we're still on target for our '26 plan. Yes. You left out the EPC part, too. I think that's one where certainly we're feeling pressure this year, and we expect to see more volatility in that part of the business given its proximity to consumers. But we still have an expectation that through SAM growth there that we will see similar growth rates there as well. So we talked about 2021 to 2026 overall. Rick said, we modeled some of the -- some softness in between, but we still feel good about the underlying assumptions of what we laid out. Perfect. Thank you. We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is the near-term. If I look at your December quarter guidance, can you help us with the growth difference between SPC and EPC. And I know this EPC was down quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, maybe just seasonality in Q1. And then related to that, if you can unpack the guidance for gross margin a little bit, it's down about 100 basis points at the midpoint, can you talk about the pluses and minuses and specifically related to revenue impact of the China regulation? Does that have a severe impact on gross margin? And I have a follow-up. Good question. So in terms of guidance for December, all the incremental revenue is coming just about all. That's likely to come from our semi process control business. I would think there'd be some impact from the new China regulations on service and the ability to grow a service quarter-to-quarter. EPC was down. I think it will be up modestly quarter-to-quarter, but the bulk of the revenue increase will come from semi PC. So I think in terms of gross margin in the September quarter, it was most of the upside, and I think we did better overall in semi PC than we expected, and EPC was a little bit weaker on the margin than we thought going into the quarter. So we had a very strong mix of business.
We had a significant sequential growth in patterning. Patterning includes reticle inspection, which tends to be a richer product line from a gross margin point of view. So that was the biggest impact that drove the upside. I think as we look at December, again, it will come back to mix dynamics in terms of how we model the business. We're kind of operating in line with the long-term range that I've talked about is somewhere between 63%, plus or minus, 50 basis points or so, and we've been operating fairly consistent with that if you look at the broader picture of calendar 2022.
So we'll see how it plays out. We've certainly been driving the business at a higher level in terms of output expectations. If you just go back to June, what was the consensus expectation for WFE both this year but also into 2023? So that's certainly been a factor in terms of how we've been sizing our business in terms of our ability to support and to ship. And as we move into 2023 and we see some of that, it could create a little bit of inventory exposure from an excess inventory point of view.
So it could have some incremental reserve exposure there as well that we contemplated as we thought about December. So those are the puts and takes. I think the China regs in terms of impact on gross margin it's more of a revenue impact. I don't think there's anything incremental from a gross margin point of view one way or the other. That's helpful. Great. My follow-up question is back to a cycle question here. In prior down cycles, KLA usually outperformed initially because customers want to improve yields, maybe continue to invest in R&D. But essentially, the downturn -- eventually, the downturn would catch up after several quarters, maybe just memory get CapEx at tax first and then time foundry/logic comes later. Remind us of why you think this time could be different. And what kind of visibility into 2023, do you have right now just based on cancellation and rescheduling, those kind of things? Thank you. So we haven't had any cancellations. And there has -- the rescheduling that there's been, I'll call it, churn in our backlog management, but backlog grew quarter-to-quarter. I would expect that we'll see more cancellations as we move into 2023. But what we said in terms of guidance of the industry down approximately 20% or so and given our expectations around the mix of business and so on and the history that we would expect KLA to perform well in that environment from a share of WFE point of view.
So I think to your other point, look, it depends on how long these soft periods last in terms of how customers ultimately adjust and then what are the demand drivers as they come out of it. But as I said before, we're much more levered to our customers' technology road maps than the increment of capacity. We're certainly doing much better in capacity investment than we used to do, particularly around some of the issues we talked about at Investor Day due to higher design starts and less reuse and so on. So those are all factors for us that are that are positive from a capacity point of view.
But at the end of the day, the biggest part of KLA's business is exposed to development and ramping up production. So as long as technology road maps hold together, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. Yeah. And let me add to that. I mean, at Investor Day, we talked more about our exposure, as Bren said, and the ability we have to scale when there's capacity. I think the other thing that's changed, particularly with EUV is we're actually more an enabling technology now. And before, we might have been more about yield management. And now with some of our products, particularly in BBP and then Rapid, those are the tools that our customers have repeatedly said, no matter what happens in this downturn, keep us on your list. We want those tools. So I think that we've broadened from being primarily a company associated with ramping yields to one of enabling technology, particularly around EUV and then in capacity. So I think we have better exposure, which is why we feel pretty good about how our products are holding up and the fact that we are getting very clear signals from customers that are saying, we understand we're slowing overall, but please do not take us out of the list. We need those tools, and we need them as soon as we can get them. Great. Thank you very much. We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. Thanks a lot. Bren, I also had a question on process control systems. And I ask because 2023 is going to be kind of a weird year because there's about $4 billion to $5 billion worth of deferred WFE just from two of your peers that should have been WFE this year but really is going to become WFE next year, and that sort of optically creates maybe like a little bit of a headwind for your WFE share. So I'm wondering if you can sort of help sift through that and maybe size what your PC systems would be for calendar 2023. It seems like $6 billion is a pretty reasonable bogey, but I'm wondering if you like that number or not. Tim, I don't want to guide 2023. We're a little bit early on that. I think you're right that there is some of the deferred revenue dynamic that will maybe skew the numbers a bit. But I think also given the things that we just said about how we're positioned into 2023 from a back on point of view and from a technology point of view that we feel pretty comfortable with our share of WFE continuing.
Also, I think feeling very good about the actual market share within process control and the, we think, some tailwinds there as well. So I think against the backdrop that you're talking about, if you're thinking WFE somewhere in the $75 billion-ish range or so, the kinds of numbers are reasonable that you're mentioning. But I'll have the ability, I think, to provide a little bit more clarity around how we see that as we move into guidance for 2023 in January. Cool. Thanks. And then, Rick, I had one for you. There was a question earlier about WFE intensity. And if you take -- the China restrictions are taking like between $7 billion and $9 billion out of WFE for next year, maybe some of that gets replaced somewhere else. But you see all the wafers and all the yields. So would you agree that maybe domestic China WFE has sort of inflated WFE intensity to some degree over the past couple of years? And maybe it's fair to take like a 50% multiplayer? I mean I don't want a number, but just the idea that you should take some sort of a handicap toward the WFE is the dollars because the productivity of those dollars is not equivalent to dollars being spent beyond China. I'm just sort of wondering how you kind of think about that. Thanks, Rick. Yes, Tim. No, I think that's true. I think that is absolutely the case that you have a situation where there was additional WFE. But it's interesting because that investment didn't really utilize EUV, so that wasn’t particularly capital-intensive investment on a relative basis. So in fact, they were prevented from it.
So I think over time, there is going to be more pressure on everybody that stays on the technology road maps to invest in technology that leverages, frankly, more to KLA, whether it's in logic, foundry or memory. And so that's why, as we said, we modeled that. It is true that will come out, but it will over time be replaced. So I think, sure, the capital intensity was probably running a bit hot because of that, but that's going to get reset. So I don't think we go back into where we were, but I don't think we go all the way down either. I think it's somewhere in between, and that's how we modeled our 2026 plan. Yeah, I would say it's more efficient today than it was in 2016 when we saw all this escalation in investment. So there is a little bit more maturation there than what we have, let's say, five, six years ago.
But generally, I would also agree. I think you also have to remember that there's investment that's happening in infrastructure to support legacy domestic consumption. And so you have wafer investment that's happening. You have some reticle investment that's happening as well.
So I think when you look at that, there is that question about how much of that is real demand versus more strategic investment. And so I think that that's -- there is some adjustment factor there, but it's probably a little bit different than what you might have thought five years ago or so.
As you think about process control intensity, typically in legacy nodes, we tend to then do fairly well as facilities are starting up. But process control intensity in the trailing edge, unless they're there are big drivers of some major change, doesn't really -- isn't really as high as it is at the leading edge.
So when you think about foundry, logic, process control intensity at the trailing edge, it's more like memory, maybe a little bit better than that in China, but it isn't like a leading-edge investment would provide. So it's a little bit different environment there from a KLA point of view. Thank you both. We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Great. Thanks so much. I had two questions as well. Bren, on the China impact, in calendar 2023, which you sized that $600 million to $900 million, I think that was a gross number. So just curious, given the fungibility of your tools and based on your current pipeline, roughly what percentage of that do you think you can repurpose and ship to other customers, at least on the systems side? Yeah. I think it's too early to tell, Toshiya. What we tried to do, and I purposely use those words that was gross. I think as we move forward, there are certain products that we will be able to repurpose fairly easily, and there are other ones that might be a little bit more difficult depending that they're back to the capacity versus technology discussion we had earlier.
So I'll have a clearer picture on how to think about that. But the way I thought about it was, as I said earlier, I looked at the backlog and I looked at our forecast in terms of expectation and timing of revenue and added up what we -- absent new regulations, what -- how much revenue we would have, and that drove the range that I provided.
And then we'll have to see also, as I said earlier, how as we progress here moving forward, what is truly out and what is and as we start to work our way through and engage with customers and get a clearer picture from the government as we go through. So I think that's the best way I can size it right now is that impact, and I would expect for more higher end products where the times are extended that we'll be able to reallocate some of those tools. Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to get your thoughts on OpEx into calendar 2023. I think it's fair to say that the WFE outlook has deteriorated over the past three months or so given memory weakness and the export controls, your business is going to be a lot more resilient than the overall market. But just given how the trajectory has potentially changed from a revenue perspective, I'm sure you're thinking through and revisiting your footprint into 2023. How should we think about OpEx? I think you talked about on a quarterly basis, things moderating into Q1. But for the full year, if you can provide some context, that would be helpful. Thank you. Yeah, I think the easiest way to think about it right now is the flattening out. So as we get a clearer picture on what the revenue profile looks like for 2023, we'll have a better level of sort of quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've invested a lot over the last couple of years to support the revenue growth and to continue to invest in driving innovation and differentiation, which is so critical to KLA's go-to-market, and so we've made those investments. We want to get returns on those investments.
So we'll be careful and judicious about how we think about it. Obviously, the reality of the business environment is a factor. But also, ensuring that we have the right products to meet our customers' road map requirements over the next few years is really critical. And I think the history at KLA has shown that in a soft period that our ability to invest and deliver what our customers need when they need it. It's been fundamental to our ability to go to market to have the portfolio and to share the value that we deliver. So it will be a balancing act across all of those kinds of dynamics. But I think from a modeling point of view, you have a model that it flattens out. There's also inflation pressures, right? We'll have a merit cycle, so we'll have to work through all of that as well, but my expectation right now is that you'll -- we're tapping the breaks and you'll see it flatten out. Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. We will take our final question from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open. All right. Thank you taking my question. First, I just want to clarify, if you and your peers cannot ship the spare parts and services to these projects, will these projects kind of like halt sometime next year as they run out of spare parts? And then I have a follow-up? The ability to support the tools, I can't speak for the peers. But I can just say for KLA systems, given the nature of our tools and the maintenance that's required to support them and the supply chain, which is fairly custom, the ability to do maintenance is important to keeping the tools up and performing as designed and spec. So without service, it becomes very hard to utilize the tools that we've shipped. Great. And then you talked about nice bookings momentum on auto-related products on advanced packaging and silicon carbide at the Investor Day. Can you update us what you're seeing in the auto market that end market seems to be holding quite well right now and into next year? Yeah. I think in automotive, it's been a nice driver for our business, and we've seen meaningful growth really across not just what's gone on in our EPC group, but also – and you have exposure in a few different places, right? We have exposure in our SPTS business, which is for process in power semiconductors but also in our semi PC business. And so we have a few offerings that we tailored to support that market, and so we've seen nice growth there. And we're encouraged by the rising semiconductor content, just basic content in cars, let alone EUV enhanced content and assisted capabilities moving forward.
So I don't have the exact number in terms of what it is. I want to say it's about $700 million or so this year in 2022 in terms of what we'll call kind of auto exposure from a revenue point of view, and we would expect to see that grow over time. And we're engaging at levels with our customers that are driving a different way of thinking about process control, given the reliability requirements in auto and the margin structure, the cost of defectivity, the cost of recall and so on. Great. Thank you. All right. We appreciate. Yeah. Thanks so much for the questions, everyone. I appreciate your time on a busy earnings week, and we will be in touch. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to conclude. This concludes the KLA Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Sir, please go, ahead. Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to our earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and our March quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. All materials can be found on our IR website.
Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events, as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights, as well as our guidance and outlook.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment, as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023.
Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams, who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment.
KLA’s December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges.
Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems.
KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022, with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. Calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate.
Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA.
Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity.
Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June.
KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.
Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging.
To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing three main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D.
Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending, while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023.
Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long-term.
Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? Thanks. As Rick has detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar 2022 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements.
Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks, as we move through the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5%, due to the impact of increasing non-cash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter.
Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendability of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid.
Looking ahead to calendar 2023, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY 2023 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY 2022, due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations.
This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows; In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAV as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy.
KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology road map investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements.
In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and align our operating structure with topline expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis, while delivering strong relative financial performance.
Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the 2022 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter.
For calendar 2023, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations.
Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million. For calendar 2023, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, headcount, and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives, while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.
Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar 2023.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares.
In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after three strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling.
Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors plan influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends.
These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.
For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions.
Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity.
Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years. We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmap to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps, and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please give instructions to queue for questions. Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about expectations to outperform WFE again here in calendar 2023. So curious, can you kind of walk through is that a comment on total revenues or just process control? And within that, how should we be thinking about the benefit from backlog/deferred revenues, particularly in the March quarter? Trying to make sure I calculate that right in my model. Hey, C.J., so I'll start, and I'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there's a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because there's other industries we're in, and it's less clear.
But given the semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE, because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology road map. So that's always a positive factor for us. We also see PC intensity moving up because it – where you generally see more cycling is in memory and so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry that tends to be something that's good for us as well.
Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical and our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA.
China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022.
In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean, the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of – of having those – the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So, some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. So, not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to longer term to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for 2023. And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share. We don't see any degradation of that in 2023 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think 2023 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. Great. Very helpful. As my follow-up, you talked about expectations for gross margins north of 60% for the whole year, guided 61.5% for March. I guess this is kind of a two-part question. I guess, how do you see kind of a trough revenue quarter here? If you can answer that. And does that mean that we would be below 60% in the back half of calendar 2023, or you think you can stay north of 60% every quarter for the year? Thanks so much. Yes, I think what we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year will be better than that overall. I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So, I think you likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of double click on your WFE expectations and then how do you think about your model. Are you thinking about first half or second half WFE being relatively balanced for the year and then within your kind of forward revenue expectations for KLA as well? I think my statements earlier were more KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate, in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yeah, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. Got it. And then just kind of maybe bigger picture. But one of your larger customers have talked about a temporary decline in the 7-nanometer utilization rates, but at the same time, also talking about working with their customers to introduce to backfill capacity, introduce new products over the next few years. I guess how do we think about that dynamic in the context of like your print check business and the mass shop? I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned. The other thing that Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. Yeah. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node. Most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate.
And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. Thank you. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Guys. Thanks for taking my question. Your services business last year was strong, right? It was up 15%. Historically, like this segment does not decline during downturns, right? Very stable subscription services contracts, expanding support opportunities, legacy nodes, more software attach, et cetera. But you do have a transactional part of the business, right, tied to manufacturing activity. You've got your EPC services business in there as well and the impact from China export control. So lots of puts and takes. So does the team believe it can grow services revenues this year? Yes. Yeah, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to semi process control, we've only had one down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.
So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support even if they're not investing in new capability. EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid to high single-digit growth rate in services overall.
So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid to high single digits. And I think EPC Systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side.
So because we have had a weaker 2022, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. Great. I appreciate that. And strong patterning growth in 2022, I think patterning was up like 50%. Obviously, part of that is being driven by EUV, DUV little adoption. And if you look at ASML's results, I mean that continues strong. But I think they're looking for EUV little systems being signed off, units being signed off this year to grow like 40%, both for EUV and Deep UV. So those shipments are always sort of a good board indicator for your business? You've got positive exposure of wafer, your reticle inspection systems, print check, litho metrology. Is this going to be one of the -- it was clearly a bigger driver last year. Is this going to be one of the bigger drivers of the potential out-performance this year for the team? Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as gate all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business.
So it's not entirely just related to the tech. And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that.
So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in 2023. And the metrology as it pertains to technology advancement development will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech notes that have a lot of challenges in those two areas. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the full year WFE view of down 20% in the kind of the mid $70 billion, that view -- that overall view doesn't seem to have changed in the last three months. But something else seems to have downshifted in the commentary from you and your peers. I'm just curious if, Rick or Bren, if you would take a look back in the last three months, what has changed from an assumption perspective? Is there a certain part of the market that you are exposed to? Like has there been any change in the last three months? Because the overall number doesn't seem to have changed. Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had three months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hasn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in 2023. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. Got it. And for my follow-up, if I'm hearing you, March is perhaps not the trough quarter for the year that, I don't know, maybe it's June or September. Any way to gauge what that kind of conceptually the trough quarter could be? Because when I look at memory, I think it's only about 15% of process control in Q1. Is that the trough for memory, or can it get even lower than that? Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There's some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in, I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Your line is open. Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe just to double back on the performance obligations. It sounds like -- I could be a little bit off here. But in terms of 12 months RPOs, maybe it's -- maybe ended the December quarter kind of a $6 billion-ish kind of level. Is that about right? And is there a point in terms of as you draw that down a little bit maybe over the next few to several quarters, is there a point in the year you can kind of point to where you think that number will stabilize? So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments.
I think, as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well.
But I don't expect to see -- I think, it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think, it will level off, as we move forward over the course of the year. But, look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. Okay. Yes. That's fair. And this is probably just digging into a question that was recently asked. But, I mean, I think the math might suggest that in the March quarter, the memory system revenue could be something like $250 million, maybe $250 million to $300 million. Maybe that's not trough, but it seems pretty low comparable to recent periods and going back low ways. And so, maybe not trough, but not too far off, is that kind of unfair conclusion? I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly as a percent of the total as low as it's been for some time. Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. The revenue decline in the March quarter is a little more severe than we kind of expected. I guess, we had thought the revenue is relatively stable, especially given the large backlog you had going into the quarter. Is it just that you were able to pull in some of the revenues into the December quarter, or was it my assumption that revenue could be stable in the near term was incorrect? Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the...
[Technical Difficulty] It seems we have lost speaker connection. Please hold.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty.
Again, ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty.
All right. We are now back live. Thank you, Chelsea. Sorry, we got cut out there. I know a little in answer to Sydney. So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter.
As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we need, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools.
Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the two quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Can I ask the second question? You talked about expecting operating expenses to come down throughout the year. What is a good level to think about exiting this calendar year? Talk about maybe what are the areas you see more -- you'll see more of the cuts. And are there any of the actions impacting the gross margin positively as well? Thanks. Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time.
It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and 105 or more into 2023, so $100 billion in 2022. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels.
But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for topline, somewhere in that -- I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So, we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.
And depending on how we see the topline evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at 2024 and size 2024, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for [Technical Difficulty] All right one moment. All right, Atif, your line is open. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. All right. So, I have a question on the memory investments. Are you expecting memory CapEx reduction to be broad this year, or just one or two memory makers? I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. Look it will vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So, when we look at it -- I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. Got it. And then on China WFE, are you expecting China WFE to be down as much as overall WFE? And what's holding China WFE? Is it the trailing edge investments? And what's driving higher investments on the trailing edge? Is it all to end market or maybe higher process control intensity? Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about 2023 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure, and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.
So, when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Hi guys, thanks. There was a question before about EUV and I'm wondering if you can sort of help give a number in terms of how much of your revenue attaches directly to EUV. There's not a ton of inspection in the litho cell, but you certainly get pulled along with anything that helps sort of ordered onto scaling. So, -- and obviously, EUV does that. So, I'm kind of wondering if you can handicap, how much of your revenue gets carried along with EUV? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is – that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. So I would say, part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're – overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5 in particular work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it Bren? I think that's good. Awesome, Rick. Thank you. Super helpful. Bren, I had a question for you on process control systems. It seems like the guidance – well, actually, it's a two-part question. It seems like the March guidance implies something in the 16.5% range for Process Control segment systems. So I wanted you to confirm that, first of all. And then the real question is the timing of when the process control systems bottoms because Lam is bottoming in March, but it seems like if I take low to mid-70s WFE, I assume you don't lose much WFE share. It's kind of hard to see the number not bottoming until you get to 1.1 roughly and you're still at 1.6. So, can you sort of answer those for me? Yeah. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces. The drop-off that you – and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say, how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking question. Rick, I guess, my first question is just to play the devil's advocate. Last quarter, you said the process control argument was site detect road map and transition and not as much as to capacity, i.e., less technical. But end of the day, it seems like process control is not immune to the cyclicality. So I'm just kind of curious, are these just like regular cyclical issues process control actually really driven by tech and not capacity purchases, and long lead time inspection doesn't matter anymore? I'm just kind of curious. Or do you think we get back to trend line in a couple of quarters? Any color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-on? Yeah. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transitions. So I think, you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those two. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline.
So I think, we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while, because the DRAM guys -- memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity as in none, they're still driving technology transitions. And we know there are multiple players now in logic trying to move forward on that. So I'd say it's a balance approach, which is why we think we'll outperform this year, but not -- we're not going to hold flat relative to that because we definitely had some capacity components. So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. Yes, Krish, we do share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. Got it. Super helpful. Thanks, Bren for that and thanks a lot Rick. And as a quick follow-up, Intel just said a while ago, they don't extend their depreciation from five to eight years. I'm just kind of curious if that -- does that mean that it's in the useful life of semi-cap equipment from five to eight years? And what does that mean for us, I mean for process control tools? If you can extend the use of the equipment, does it mean that less purchasing over the longer term? So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So, I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect.
I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in long-term view based on that decision by one customer. And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. So I think it's a reflection of, at least to Rick's point and how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector of not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. Thank you, Krish. Chelsea, I believe we're coming close to the bottom of the hour, top of the hour. Probably time for one more question. Yes, sir. Our last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I just had a couple of housekeeping questions, if that's okay. The China impact, the export restriction impact in the December quarter and what you're assuming for calendar 2023, Bren, sorry if I missed this, but if you can remind us how big the impact could be or was in Q4 and... Yeah. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of the impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. Got it. And then on DRAM versus NAND, I think when you were going through the WFE assumption, you mentioned your expectation for DRAM to be down more than NAND. But when you think about your own business, KLA's business, I would expect DRAM to be a little bit more resilient given EUV adoption insertion and the benefits there. Is that the right way to think about your business in calendar 2023 on a relative basis? Yes, yes. Okay. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAD as a percent. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Great. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We know it's a really busy day of earnings. We also apologize for the technical difficulties we had during the call, but we will be catching up with all of you here afterwards. So I appreciate the interest and speak soon. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation December 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the March 2023 quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.
During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market closed. All materials can be found on our IR website. Today's discussion is being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they are for calendar years.
A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and linked to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our commentary is subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings.
Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and our outlook.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets. Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges.
From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy notes remain strong. Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth.
Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process, as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical.
We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter. Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment.
Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where a zero-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test methods.
As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide, that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023.
In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses.
And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow.
Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace, continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams.
I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful.
Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49 above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8%, at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to affect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.
Factory under-absorption also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.
Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52.
Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies.
Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow.
Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar 2023 from approximately $95 million in 2022. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business. We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the US government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded.
Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide. Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply inline with demand. We expect Foundry/Logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall, due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.
Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus one percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix. Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar 2023, with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability.
Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments. As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar 2023, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range.
Other model assumptions for the June quarter include; other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares.
In conclusion, after three years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar 2023. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar 2022.
Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth.
Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services.
We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders.
And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q& A session. Kevin? Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A, and then begin the Q&A? Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Good afternoon. And great to see you had another year of strong share gains from the team last year. You reiterated your full year WFE outlook at down 20%. You also talked about your process control business remaining stable at the June quarter levels through the remainder of this year. I'm wondering if the stable outlook also reflects the stabilization of cancellation and pushout activity from what I assume has been a pretty volatile bookings environment over the past six months? Hey Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.
So, that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than one, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. Perfect. Thanks for that. And then on your EPC franchise, this -- it's driven pretty strong growth, right, 10% to 11% CAGR over the past three years, that's including Services. It even grew 7% last year, right, in a slower consumer environment.
Coming into this year, though, you guys are already driving an EPC systems profile of down about 20% year-over-year. Do you still anticipate the EPC business to grow this year, to outperform WFE growth? And sort of at a high level, how are you thinking about EPC profile second half versus first half? Yes, it's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead-time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half.
And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.
But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses.
SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year. It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. Well perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, surprised you haven't changed your foundry WFE outlook for 2023 at all. Many of your peers discussed modest adjustments there. So, would love to hear your thoughts as to what's offsetting that?
And as part of that, can you speak to the lead-times for optical inspection, which I still think are well beyond 12 months? So, is that the kind of the key to the story for KLA where you're finding this sustainable level at the June level in the second half? Yeah, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So, obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. Great. And then maybe just to follow-up on the legacy part. You talked about native China being 25% of process control. How much of that is silicon wafer versus just traditional front-end equipment? So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing -- optical inspection. You asked about lead times on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question.
So lead times on optical inspection are still pretty long. There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in the down WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year, given those dynamics. Fair enough. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious what's giving you the confidence that sales have bottomed when many of your memory customers still appear to have a lot of inventory and are unclear when their utilization will pick up. So specifically, how is your visibility to the memory demand for the back half of this calendar year? Do you think it will be about this level, it'll be lower, above this level? Because I noticed that in June, the implied memory sales seem to be picking up, albeit of small numbers. So just any comments on how you're thinking about memory demand recovery from here as it pertains to what you think about utilization at your key memory customers? Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, the 23% that we talked about in June and even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations. And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend.
We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology.
So, even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. Got it. And from my follow-up, I realize it's early, but I thought that given that you have long lead-times and you are engaged in the technology side with many customers, you probably have a decent view of how the calendar 2024 might look like.
So, I'm not asking for numerical guidance, but what's your gut right now that is WFE likely to grow next year? Is it supposed to be flat or down? Like what could be just the kind of qualitative puts and takes as we start thinking about WFE next year? Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part.
And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year.
So, if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar 2024, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one, Rick or Bren, you spoke about resuming some shipments to China. Can you quantify in terms of millions of dollars, how much that you're going to expect to recoup in the second half? And is that baked into your view that revenue will stay around these levels into the calendar second half?
And along the same path, this China shipment assumption is tied to kind of lagging as memory, and I'm kind of curious, what exactly you mean by lagging as memory because I thought memory is always at leading edge? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall.
So, look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So, that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up, should we still expect your service revenues to grow this year? And how to think about the service between the Semi and the EPC portion? Yeah, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yeah, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. Yeah. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some ideally that capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%.
As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. But still growth, to Rick's point and on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. Got it. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren. Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just a first of clarification. For the clarification on export restrictions that you received, that $200 million you're thinking about for the second half of this year, did that reenter your backlog or RPO this quarter? Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we had certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. Got it. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin side, how should we think about inventory reserves for the rest of this year? And then can you just remind us how do we think about the timing of those reversals? Yeah. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in 2021 and 2022 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in 2021 and 2022 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply.
So what I would expect within this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendability and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts. It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment.
So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand. But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have two questions on China. First, is the number of customers you're engaged domestically in China on trailing edge higher this year versus last year or the year before? I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. I mean, I – but yeah, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. Okay. And then on multinational companies in China, Rick, in your discussions with these companies, how are they looking at their future capacity expansions given that the license period for the export restrictions is coming due in September, October? I mean, how are they looking strategically on investments in China? Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's – they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there – they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter, which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. Understand. Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. Bren, I had two. So first, I'm just trying to tie your process control systems commentary to WFE. And it sounds like Orbotech systems, I mean, you're not exclusively saying this in June, but it sounds like they're pretty flattish. So process control systems have to be about 15.50, down maybe $175 million from March.
And then in the shareholder letter, you're saying that it's going to remain flat into the back half of the year at that level. So if I just take the 17.20 you did in March and then I take the 15.50 in June and I flatline that, and I used $75 billion this year in WFE, that implies you're like 8.5% this year for WFE share, that's -- I mean, that's a record high.
So I guess the question is, is there something structural going on that you think there's staying power to where your WFE share could stay that high? Usually, I think, six in the trough and eight in the peak, but you're sort of like 8.5, or maybe is it that your $75 billion numbers too low? Tim, I'm not – we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now.
In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at 2023 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us.
Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point.
I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers. And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well.
So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics, that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market.
Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms.
And those two -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. Thanks a lot. And then I guess I had a question also on WFE. And some people are trying to get at this, I think. But -- so WFE is still sort of flat in the $75 million range. I think, Bren, you said that that there's $200 million for you that can shift that sort of an add-back of stuff that was banned in the past. So if you're less than 10% of WFE, that's probably like a few billion dollar add back from just from China there, and then there's all this lagging edge stuff happening in China. So is it that the lagging edge kind of stuff -- like it's not helping this year? It's more helping next year? I guess I'm a little surprised that the $75 billion number is not higher just given the massive increase in bookings that we're seeing from lagging edge in China? Thanks. Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one.
We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right? We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So, a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. Awesome, Bren, thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking questions. I want to follow-up with the previous question about -- you talked about the stabilizing demand and maybe a similar profile for the rest of the year. Are you expecting your revenue for the back half of the year to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of that $200 million of recoup revenue, or are there other factors to consider whether it's on the service business on the EPC side of things? Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid single-digit given that guidance.
And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is one of your largest customers in Taiwan talked about higher levels of tool reuse between the 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers. How is this factored into your second half outlook and maybe even the longer-term outlook? And do you think that's anything incremental to what the industry's current level of capacity is used between those? Thanks. It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So, nothing really new in what we see in those statements. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a follow-up question to Sidney's question. Given the depth and breadth of design start activity you're seeing in the leading edge foundry space. What are your expectations for process control intensity into 2024? Is there a bias potentially to the upside from where you are in 2023? Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows.
It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling, but also more layers here moving forward.
So those are all positives for us. Also, depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well.
So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market, as it relates to Foundry/Logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. Got it. That's helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I think you commented specifically on China as it pertains to your business with wafer suppliers and reticle suppliers as well.
But curious on a global basis, how big are those businesses today? And how should we think about sustainability over the next 12 months or so, again, on the wafer side as well as both merchant and captive reticle customers? Thank you. Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall, wafer -- and I'm separating this way, because I don't want to double count.
But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thank you. You talked about kind of qualitatively about Services not being down this year, maybe up a little bit this year. Can you talk about the utilization impact on that? And as you see utilizations coming down in both Foundry and Memory, I guess I would think that has less impact on you than it does for some of the other guys. But can you just talk to how utilization might weigh on that number? The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the Memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue, because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment.
So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word, is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. That's helpful. Thank you. And then separately, on China, you guys have talked to the sort of China trailing-edge logic opportunity a couple of different times here. Your sense for whether there's building ahead there. I mean, I would assume you have customers there that have anxiety about future export controls. Could they be putting in capacity? I guess maybe a different way of asking the question, do you see utilization that kind of validates the requirement of the spending, or do you worry that it could be a building ahead of supply? Yeah. It's possible. I mean, we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies.
Remember, there's a very active EV market in China. So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious, I mean, you talked about in the outlook, legacy growing faster than leading edge. Just curious if you could give us a perspective where that mix is within Foundry/Logic today? And maybe a perspective of where it's come from? Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about or 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging. So to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter.
And it's broad-based and certainly, China is a pretty big factor in all, but you also have a fair amount of investments happening from the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these earned markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge and our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots.
So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last six months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. Thanks. And then I wanted to ask you on the inventories on the balance sheet. I think it's a record level -- near record in data as well. So I guess kind of everybody has this phenomena going on. How are you thinking about managing that the top line kind of flat to down? I'm kind of curious if inventories will still grow and any impact on gross margin as you work it down? Yeah. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems, and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them.
And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of service, extendability of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much.
That's why even in these very strong upturn environments. We've rarely gotten above -- much above two times from an inventory term point of view. So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Your line is open. Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for asking the question. Maybe for Rick, trailing edge clearly is sort of as less process control intensive. But I guess to what extent does the immaturity of these production lines, particularly in China a lot of greenfield situations and also the desire for faster time to market, how do these factors kind of counteract that typical kind of lower intensity for trailing edge? Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's one thing.
The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have you get more efficiency on a large fab. And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result.
They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. Great. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of the percent of memory increasing in the June quarter -- and it looks like also on a dollar basis as well, I think you suggested it's pretty focused towards DRAM. Can you characterize the nature of that uptick, or is this more of a kind of a classic case of coming off such lows in March that this is really more of a bouncing along a bottom kind of situation? Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities. Got it. Thank you Brian. Operator, we have time for one last question. Our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two follow-ups for me. If I just take your commentary regarding the revenue trend first half and second half of the calendar, it seems to me that the peak to trough decline in revenues in the 25% to 30% range. And I'm not asking you for a guide. But what I wanted to better understand, if you did close to $3 billion in December of 2022 with a WFE in the $90 billion to $95 billion. Can you go and hit those revenue run rate without WFE – if no WFE having to go to $90 billion does your diversification looking forward, especially with semiconductor material and others, would enable you to hit $33 billion without having WFE to go to $90 billion plus? And I have a follow-up. Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things – and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue, lower WFE levels as that sustains.
Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there.
So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in one year. We talked a lot about half point to one point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/ logic in terms of overall mix of WFE that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. If any of your customers were to reuse some of the equipment, how should we think about price diagnostic content for that application? Well as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others.
It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities.
But I am sure they will look for opportunities if in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So, those tend to be longer term decisions.
So, structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment. What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online.
And given the design start environment at seven and five, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So, we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mehdi. And thank you, everyone, for your time today for -- we know it's busy earnings season. I appreciate it. We'll be seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chelsea, so she can provide any final instructions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the June 2023 quarter and our September quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace; and our CFO, Bren Higgins.
During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close along with supplemental materials that are all available on our IR website. Today’s discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full-year references, they relate to calendar years.
A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosure in our SEC filings.
Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Rick, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin. Let’s start with a summary of KLA’s performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA’s June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution, despite a challenging marketplace.
Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges.
As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remained strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries.
Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers, and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process, as well as the early ramp phase when faster timely yield is critical.
KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership and process control, which includes some of the most critical and fast-destroying segments of WFE. Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and vertical infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA.
For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. The KLA services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year over year.
Our consistent execution, despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements.
I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading growth in operating markets, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful.
Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion, towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97 above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix, as upside in the quarter was driven by higher margin products. Normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjust to current demand expectations.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were 543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised 314 million in R&D and 229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense debt was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%.
If the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower, or $5.33. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million. Gap net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million. And free cash flow was $880 million.
As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119%. And free cash flow margin was 37%. The company had approximately $137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets in major products regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Switching to the balance sheet KLA ended the quarter with 3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.89 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agencies.
Turning to our outlook, our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business. And we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year.
Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows; in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%. Foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes.
KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements.
In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road map and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.
Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70%, and memory is expected to be around 30% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND 10%.
We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus one percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%.
Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares.
In conclusion, we continue to see process controls and bonds technology transitions and advanced key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023.
Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling, driving semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results.
Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. While the global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well-positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multi-year investment plans.
For the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide instructions for questions. Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the strength that you're seeing in your blank wafer business. How do you see that looking into next year? And is there a risk of maybe some digestion after a pretty strong investment cycle there? Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply.
It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical, but the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers to take some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand, they're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well.
So look at this year, it's going to continue to grow, this year, expected to do well. And then -- but I do think, as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up. You guys saw some pretty -- I think any upside to your memory kind of expectations or at least relative to what you were thinking three months ago, and particularly around DRAM. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what drove that in the quarter? So we had some movement across a number of our customers, and the numbers overall is, frankly, pretty low, but that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to one of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first
question, can you update us on where optical inspection lead times are? And
given the importance of that tool set for R&D lines. Is that something that you
expect will sustain at elevated levels, or do you think that should normalize
over time? Hi, C.J. It's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through as far as we can see into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing.
So we expect that to remain elevated, and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24, and beyond we see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time.
One of the nice we talked about in the past data is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5 and Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in prices that we didn't necessarily forecast in automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, encouraging to see your semi service business grow sequentially. Can you kind of comment how you see that playing out in the second half? And what kind of potentially negative impact are you seeing from lower utilization from your memory customers? Yes. We're very pleased with the performance and service, and it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see service utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization asking us to back off a little bit.
And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what has been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading edge leading-edge logic foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard, but it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the services business. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I close the first one, Rick, obviously, you have like very strong revenues from China. -- there's been some chatter that the U.S. might expand export control maybe mature nodes. I know right now, your cap at 14-nanometer and below for foundry logic. Is there any commentary you can give on that? And how to think about it, like, let's say, for example, 14 goes to 28, the restriction of 28 goes to 40 [ph], is there a way to quantify the impact to your sales? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, I won't calculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really -- we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China as legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. Got it. Got it. Thanks for that Rick. And then as a follow-up, based on the numbers it looks like you're going to outperform WFE again this year, and you did last couple of years, the last couple of years, it is more -- some of your peers were supply chain constrained while you were not and this year, obviously, there's a lot of technology bias. I am just wondering, as we head into the next couple of years, as WFE starts rebounding, is there a risk that some of the fabs already bought process control equipment that you could actually underperform WFE? Well, so I would say that we were supply constrained, but for a different reason, we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we manage our supply chain, but we still had gaps. It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up.
I mean one thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing by out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and more layers, and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control, and that's really what we're experiencing. So when we talk about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the splits of the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. Got it. Thanks a lot Rick. Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Hi. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the good results. A few of your peers have talked about fab readiness being impacting their shipment this year, especially for EUV tools. Is that something that you already kind of factored in WFE outlook you gave a quarter ago when you also said foundry and logic will be down 10%, which you should reiterate today, or are there some of the offsets that you would point out that kind of offset that? Yeah. Sidney, it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. But it's something that we already made adjustments for. I think it tends to usually shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. Okay. Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, speaking of China, I know the revenue is now back to the 30% level you talked about some of the shipments that came in a little earlier. But I want to ask if this is a little bit different angle. It's clear that there is a big push of self-sufficiency in China, but certain process are harder to replace than others. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on the competitive dynamics there that some of your process control requirements could be satisfied by domestic companies? Thanks. Yeah, our market share continues to be strong. I mean, we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, we started some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive really at all price points turns. So, we feel while there is more competition trailing edge, we're very well-positioned to be able to win.
And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So, we feel good about our ability to compete, again, standing competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So, this is not unique that we would have competition in China.
And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So, we can offer a lot of solutions to our customers.
To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even de-configured versions or more recent tools. And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So, our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else.
Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. Hi there. Thanks, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. understanding again that memory investment in general is reduced, and it sounds like the China memory shipment might have hit there in the June quarter.
But if I were to assume that some of your DRAM activity in coming quarters will be more beer towards DR5 and applications for outperformance high-density DRAM for data center and AI applications. Are you noticing or anticipating a higher level of process control intensity for that kind of spend? Look for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and medical facility. That's been the driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years.
And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see. And I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year.
But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to create a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments.
Now we will participate in process node development as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader follow-up question. Obviously, there's some underutilization of capacity at the leading foundries more advanced nodes and this might just be a cyclical phenomena, but in your conversations with them, it detect any changes in how they might elect to deploy capital in support of multiple advanced nodes differently? I mean they've slowed down. I mean, for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So, I think that's been the main one.
What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced out -- and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing -- but I think that this slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that as pretty good as we get the next few quarters, is behind us. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Thanks a lot. Bren. Can you give the purchase obligation number? I think it was about $12 billion last quarter. I assume it came down a smidge and book-to-bill is still lessened. And then also, can you tell us how much is sitting out side of 12 months on? So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter to quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than one. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to 11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it. It's delivered beyond the 12 month window. Cool. Thanks for that. And then, Bren, just from the soft guide for December, it sounds like process control system shipments are pretty flat. It looks like maybe EPC should be up a smidge, because you had said before that EPC would be about, you know, down about 20 for the year. So is that right? And I guess part of that was that you had said last call that maybe the process control shipments in December depended on a couple projects. So sort of what's the, you know, what are like puts and takes on process control shipments in December? Yeah, I don't want to get specific on guiding December, but certainly consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward, and obviously that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments.
That being said, service continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter just like it generally always has as the install base continues to grow over time and so we see growth in service. EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile, so I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see, it's a good indicator given its short lead time. It's more capacity-centric. It's closer to consumer, so it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover because it weakened earlier -- and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the semi PC part of it.
And then so semi PC, I think, will generally be somewhat consistent with -- with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter.
Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year. We'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December and so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame. We -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see – see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. Great, Bren. Thanks a lot. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan, please make sure you're off mute. Yes. Sorry about that. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe on a follow-up to Tim's question. Your prior view was for process control to be down roughly kind of mid-teens, right, relative to WFE, which was down 20%. Now also the better June quarter results and if I flat line stabilize that process control for the remainder of the calendar year after the June quarter. It looks like your process control franchise is actually going to be down only 10% to 12% for the full year. So even better outperformance versus WFE. You mentioned not inspection, their wafer or strong dynamics. Like what other product segments are driving the better implied outlook for process control? Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about their wafer obviously, being a strong driver, optical inspection, reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. So -- so we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there.
Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control tends to be there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. No, I appreciate that. Advanced packaging demand is picking up quite strongly, right, driven by all these accelerated compute workloads like AI, right, you have HBM, coleus [ph] packaging, multichips 0.5 [ph] configuration. TSMC, Intel, all the memory guys, those saturate, you guys supplying to all of them. Are you seeing the demand pick up for your solutions for accelerated compute applications? And the advanced packaging segment growing this year for the team, or is that sort of AI-accelerated compute demand being somewhat offset by some of the more consumer-focused end markets. Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase. There haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small – relatively small number at as a percent. It's got quite a bit, but off of a small number. So absolutely, we've seen it, and we see it directly tied to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and finding some of the products we have semi process control and EPC, we've absolutely seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that.
Yes, you had the overall packaging market down with 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are recurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a question on leading-edge logic investments. At Semicon West a couple of weeks ago, when we spoke to the suppliers, there were expectations at the leading edge spending could be up less than mature nodes into next year? And I assume a process control intensity is higher on leading versus mature nodes. My question for you is, are there any major product cycles or EV or x-ray or major contribution from areas like auto, which could help perhaps offset your exposure to leading edge investments next year? Sure. I think that for KLA, the one thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. So I think that's one factor.
And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that much so than one who is primarily focused on capacity we see. Good. Thank you. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you very much, Chelsea, and I wanted to thank everyone again for their interest and their time. We know it's a very busy earnings season, and it's also a very busy day, and this was a later call in order to try to accommodate as much as we could. So we look forward to speaking to all of you in the weeks ahead.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for any final remarks. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation second quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the September 2023 quarter and our December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Richard Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins, to discuss our results released today after the market close, which are available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified, [ our ] full year references all related to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick. Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter [indiscernible] outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. [ At ] KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon.
Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74. Both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA team continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments.
The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy notes despite softness in memory and learning edge, logic and foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity. KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio.
Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer and adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employ deploying and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV Lithography, and advanced packaging.
KLA service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track or high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion.
In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams.
I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren? Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all 3 coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. [ At ] the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77.
 Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid.
I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level and approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally [indiscernible] KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets.
Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our wafer fab equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021.
KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology [ interest ] and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer movements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.
As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid 61% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately [ $45 million ] and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%.
 Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60.
EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares. In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology road maps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sized in our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology road map requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis.
We are confident that process controls importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better than market performance of our semiconductor process control and specialty semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks.
Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please provide the instructions to queue for Q&A, and we'll begin now. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. I wanted to revisit your suggestion that first half could be stable at this -- the December quarter levels. So does it mean you're not expecting any change to your China shipment? Or if you could just kind of give us how you are thinking about the mix in different end markets and geos. And then kind of part b of that is, what assumptions are you making about the timing of memory recovery? Is that still kind of second half awaited and can it be incremental to this kind of conceptual first half outlook? Vivek, it's Bren. So we are -- I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment. I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels. And anything on the potential recovery in memory, like if, let's say, memory were to be recovering in Q1, Q2, Q3, is that visibility you would necessarily have? Or if I ask it in a different way, what is kind of the difference between when you start to see it and when it actually starts to show up in your sales numbers? Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently. They've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products where we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. On your services business, close to 25% of your sales, you'll be driving high single-digit percentage growth this year, and that's with customer production activity at an all-time low. But in your shareholder letter, you guys say that you expect growth in services to accelerate to your target range of 12% to 14% next year. I know you've got to waive those tools and systems coming off of warranty and on to contract. This would be a big driver. But what else are you guys assuming on the strong growth outlook for next year? And what are your assumptions for industry manufacturing utilization? Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. You did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high. So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers. Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slow down that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes. I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have -- depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business. No. Great. That's hugely insightful. Given the strong lineup and aggressive cadence of tech transitions, right, especially in foundry and logic and that's obviously driving more EUV layer adoption, right, which is driving demand for both your optical inspectors, vertical inspection, your entire portfolio of metrology products as well. If we look into next year with more tech inflections, to gate all around introduction of backside power distribution, next-gen advanced packaging architecture, is that wave of new tools, systems adoptions to support these transitions. Is that still in front of the KLA team? Or are you actually starting to see quite a bit of that now? Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar '24 and beyond. Our next question will come from Joseph Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. First is for Bren, I know it will come out in the queue, but can you help us with the RPO where that was exiting the quarter? It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Okay. That's helpful. And then just in that kind of context, how do we think about the optical inspection lead times? I think you mentioned that the demand remains stronger than supply, your ability to supply but how do we think about that looking into this first half of '24? Do you expect that you'll start to see maybe some of that alleviate in the first part of next year as we get into more demand into the second half? Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in '24 than we have in '23. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer. Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. I wonder if you can speak a bit about the China business right now. A little more color on the strength that you're seeing and you obviously heard this from your peers as well. And I think the investor questions right now are about the sustainability of the China revenue at these areas. I wonder if you could address that. Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board. But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both [ mass ] [indiscernible] and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any -- I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics. In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to -- so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary. So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a -- in excess of $800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat.
You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of '21 and '22, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots. So as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make. Just as a follow-on to some of the other things you said with -- as you're starting to fill some of those orders for, say, some of those Chinese customers that were you weren't able to fulfill because of some of the shortages before, what effect has that had on the backlog? And is your backlog visibility going out in time about the same as it was last quarter, a quarter before? Or is that backlog visibility is starting to shrink as you catch up on some of those orders that you weren't able to fulfill before? I would say with new business coming into backlog, but it's not changing all that much. Right. So about the same. I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply-demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer demand. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Bren, in the past, you have talked about the China domestic spending as 1/3, memory makers, 1/3 kind of mature foundries and 1/3 as a new entrant the market? And my question is like you're talking about China to drop somewhat in Q4, which segment of the China market you're seeing the drop off in Q4? Yes. I'm not -- I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't -- I'm not -- we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that. Got it. And then, Rick, I have a question on gate all around. Historically, you guys have benefited when the transistor move to [ fintech ] architecture. And as we start to see initial orders on data around for some of the deposition companies. Can you talk about what that data around opportunity means for both infection and metrology for KLA. Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, [indiscernible] has been in development for a while. So we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to get all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So we're well prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated.
Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafer and also some of the specifics around the [indiscernible] metal gate control that people are looking for. So more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So we've worked with development partners on that. feel well positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. I want to ask about the DRAM strength that you guys are seeing. It seems like that was the main source of revenue upside in the quarter, and it looks to be -- based on your comments, down slightly in the next quarter and [indiscernible] Q4, how much of that strength is coming from shipping to the DRAM customers in China that you alluded to in the past? And how much of that is tied to advanced DRAM technology, high bandwidth memory and whatnot. And when you look at Q4, which part of that segment is going to come down? Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really -- the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But -- and then [indiscernible] just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to. One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related [indiscernible]. So that is also a driver smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now. Okay. Great. And maybe a follow-up for me. If you look at the SPC systems revenue, it looks like it's going to be down 5% to 7% in calendar '23. I think a quarter ago, that number was like down 10% to 12%. Can you talk about what has changed? Is it just that the WFE market has improved somewhat? Or are there other KLA specific reasons that you will point out. But more importantly, how do you think that outperformance will do next year considering some of the areas that you are strong in this year may see some moderation? I'm sorry, for EPC or would that was SPTS. Yes, that's for SPC. Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength -- we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong. We talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there. Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to [indiscernible] provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers. So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we this year. Process control intensity is helping in I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in '22 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic, foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. [indiscernible] Bren, I'm curious, you mentioned like the demand profile stays in the first half of next year. But some of your peers are called calender '24 like a transition year. And how do I overlay the fact that memory could rebound in the back half of next year, how to think about these industry WFE or KLA revenue profile next year? So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what '24 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels.
What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term product that -- [ or ] products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into '24 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that. Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. that's certainly a factor. We, of course, we watch our customers business models, their profitability, their cash flows that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year.
In our near term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do. And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near term is reflected in [indiscernible] Got it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. As you said, has seen the recent export control work has no material impact to your outlook? And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the, I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex. Next, we'll have Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Brent, everyone's asking about 2024 WFE, but I guess I'm still a little confused as to what the right baseline is for this year because pretty much everyone has now guided for Q4. So if I take you plus applied plus Lam, yes, it's down 13%. So that would mean that your $80 billion number might be in the ballpark off of that [ mid-90s ] last year. But if I include ASML, it's like flat. I mean even if you exclude the fast shipments, it's fairly down. So how is WFE down this year? I guess I'm just trying to get some understanding of like how you get to that $80 billion number. Is it excluding ASML somehow? Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what -- we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late '22 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in '22 and how that shows up in '23. But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our belief about our market position. And if you look at [ SME ] PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me. Okay. Al right, Bren. And then I guess my second question is on inventory. It's now up to almost 300 days. It's up like $500 million over the past 6 months, but we're not really sure when WFE picks up inside of next year. I get that you still have this huge $10.8 billion worth of PO that you're kind of working [ off ]. But why is this stuff parked so far out in the future? Is it -- and if so, why hold the inventory now? What's the bottleneck? Is there something on your side still that's a bottleneck? Or is it more that the orders have been placed and maybe waiting for the fab to be ready to take the equipment and that's why you're building up the inventory. I guess I'm just not sure why you would build the inventory if this stuff is still parked so far in the future. Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15 months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. We had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions.
We manage our -- so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry.
And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success. Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. This morning, I think one of your smaller peers in Europe, they talked about seeing some weakening of the mature in foundry, logic side I wonder if KLA is seeing something similar. I mean either through your process control business or the PC business? If not, why is that? And I have a second question. Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent. Got it. So Bren, maybe a question on OpEx. Both of your peers in the bay area, they are raising their OpEx for basically the next calendar year. How should we think about KLA's OpEx going into next year, say, you talked about you're expecting revenue to be run rating at the current level. should we be thinking OpEx is kind of flat until you see the uptick in the revenue. I mean before you really raise the OpEx. Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements. And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of top line when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through '24, but not a big change. more in line with general kind of post living type adjustments overall. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You talked about maybe a little bit of weakness at the cutting edge of foundry logic. Wonder if you could talk about that. And then I guess, just contextually, if we're in an environment where there's very aggressive investment in gate all around and backside power, but they're sort of limited wafer requirements in year 1 for those technologies. I would think that helps KLA in terms of percentage of WFE, but can you just walk us through how much of your -- how much money will they spend on the development of those processes versus the expansion of wafer that capability there? Well, so we still -- we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see -- that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, more or tooth generation. So on balance, doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense.
So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the -- so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry logic to memory. And memory is increasing some -- so yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging. Yes. The road map schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more 3, you're going to see 2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And -- but most -- the bulk of it will be more at M3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back. But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or -- and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. I just wanted to follow back up on the comments you just made on foundry logic. So it was flat. It seems like China is probably up within that mix, and then you said leading edge is weak. I'm just kind of curious how that changes for December. It seems like the outlook is fairly flat. So is that weakness in leading-edge kind of stabilize -- and then kind of any perspective as to where leading edge goes next year? So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, right, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here. I just want to ask on service, in your letter, you talked about getting back to that 12% to 14%. I just want to know, is that assuming any utilization increases? Or is that just purely the tools coming off of their agreement? Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract. I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into '24, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Yes. Just a quick follow-up. As you think about the R&D price, especially you highlighted gate all around at some point, we have to change the narrative to [ high NA ]. And I want to just give an update, how do you see kind of opportunities as it relates to [ high-NA ] specifically on the patterning? And I have a follow-up. Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling -- we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scale it. So high-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength. So part of what our modeling is when we look -- we don't see a lot of high NA happening in the time line that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive -- continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity. Are you implying that Gen 5 could be -- the use of Gen 5 could be extended to high NA for [indiscernible] . absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption. So it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind mine in the -- on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the high the hyper, which is going to come after that. So we feel very good about our optical product portfolio. Okay. And then the second follow has to be on China, it seems like for KLA and the peer group, the China mix is getting closer to 50%. Could there be a scenario where opportunities for KLA would actually step up given the fact that many of these customers are new, and they have yield issue. And I understand China is mostly for [ trading ] edge, but with new entrants, new players with the higher entrances and improving yield by these new players, have a higher mix of China for KLA relative to the peer group. Well, you have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now as they continue to put road maps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node. But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to -- because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along road maps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will hire in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project. Our last question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. I'll just ask 1 question then to get us out of here. But -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've gotten a sense maybe that given how strong the infrastructure bear wafer and reticle inspection business into China was this year that it could subside a little in the calendar '24 relative to its strength again this past year. Is that sort of implicit in your outlook in the first half next year? And also, do you think that is proportional in any way to sort of the rate of China fab bill activity that you can maybe observe for next year? Well, I don't think it's -- I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will -- that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So there's that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability. Thank you, Chelsea. I just wanted to thank everyone again for their time and turn the call back over to you for any final instructions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for joining the earnings call to discuss the December 2023 results and the March quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins.
We will discuss today's results release after the market close and available on our IR website, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our full year references all relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP -- of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the earnings material posted on our website. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on 10-Q and 10-K.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and the December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker-than-expected leading-edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment.
KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry-leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion.
Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue improved 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all 3 of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today.
Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high-throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolved critical yield challenges.
KLA's Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves.
In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth maps.
I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance. Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million, and free cash flow was $545 million.
As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchase of intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long-term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted to 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook.
Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months.
Based on current [ vast ] schedules and our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid- to high $80 billion roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top-down assessment of industry demand as follows: In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading-edge node development.
Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments.
Foundry/logic is expected to be slightly up with leading-edge investment returning to modest growth levels. Legacy investment declining versus 2023 and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels.
As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of Semi Process Control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.
Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat from the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter.
For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares.
In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations.
The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends.
In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling.
That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you can just give the instructions and set up the queue. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. It looks like relative to your prior view, the March quarter came in lower by roughly about $200 million. I know you talked about a customer project delay that materialized just over the last couple of months. It looks like based on your December quarter end market mix and expected March quarter mix that it's a foundry/logic customer. Was that a leading edge or mature node customer, was the delay more technology-related or just weak demand trends? And does the sequential growth outlook beyond March assume that this customer comes back this year? Harlan, it's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business, too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter.
So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers where the fabs are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained.
So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy. No, I appreciate the insights there. Your total process control systems business outgrew WFE yet again, right, in calendar '23. Within that, Inspection significantly outperformed, right? It was only down 5%, but your Patterning business was down almost 20%, which is actually worse versus WFE. And it's like most of that full year underperformance was due to the sharp drop-off in patterning just in the December quarter. So was that tied to the customer pushout dynamics, as you mentioned? Or is it just the lumpy shipment trends in patterning? And I guess, do you guys expect process control systems business to outgrow WFE this year? Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think -- if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading-edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection. And that's what we saw in '23. Harlan, it's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was.
The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here at KLA. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. I just wanted to go back to the pushout. So that I just sort of understand, if we were to adjust for the couple of hundred million that's now pushed into the June quarter and assumed it was still in the March quarter, I guess, would you still expect that the June quarter would be up quarter-over-quarter? Or would it be more flattish like we were thinking or talking about last quarter, just the first half kind of still being a similar run rate of the business? Yes. I think it's more the latter, right? We've, obviously, got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided was [ $2.450 billion ] right? We ended up outperforming by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I like sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're going to -- you'll file your 10-Q probably tomorrow, but any color on where the RPO stood exiting the quarter? Yes. So RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yes, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits. Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. I guess, first question, can you speak to domestic China? And I guess, to what degree '23 was helped by bare wafer and reticle inspection and your thoughts on how that progresses in '24. And I guess with the mix shift to perhaps maybe incrementally more DRAM. And I don't know in terms of the really core legacy some shift is there. How are you seeing your kind of implied market share '24 versus '23? So for China -- C.J. I think overall, for China it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher [indiscernible].  I think the memory piece will shift to -- potentially shift to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall.
So feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question, C.J.? No, you covered it. I guess, for my follow-up, as you think about kind of second half stronger than first half, how would you kind of rank order leading-edge foundry logic versus DRAM in terms of the key drivers for you? I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say -- I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading-edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. I have 2 of them too. One is, I was just kind of curious, Rick, if you can kind of give color how to think about China revenues this year ex EPC? Well, Bren just covered that, but -- in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish, little less infrastructure than we saw, especially, in wafer and reticle continues to remain basically level at this current run rate. Got it. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. If I look at kind of like where your optical inspection is and you said that revenue should start improving over time. Where is the lead times today for them -- today versus, let's say, 3 months or 6 months ago? And where do you expect them to go over the next few months? Yes. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have -- right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between 7 and 9 months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame.
So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the -- within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into '25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in '22. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. I want to ask a few questions. Maybe just -- I think someone might have had asked this earlier in the queue, but taking your WFE sort of outlook for flat to modest based on your '23 base level, flat to modest growth this year, relative to sort of the pickup and maybe your revenue and WFE being sort of in the second half kind of modest, right? You probably would need to see an acceleration in the back quarters of the year in order to kind of get to say even towards the mid -- the low to mid-single-digit kind of growth that you're talking about for WFE at the moment. So I'm kind of curious, do you see process control intensity type of profile of spending this year sort of neutral in terms of WFE, do you think intensity is higher or lower, relative to this -- again that profile of spending this year? And then how does that reflect in your revenue? Yes. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high single-digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the 7% depending on your WFE number, but assuming you're $87 billion to $88 billion in WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24.
And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading-edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now. Okay. And then just given that emphasis this year on memory conversions and upgrade activity, can you comment on the areas where KLA benefits and how meaningful a benefit that this sort of spending represents? You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that's tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increase as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity, it will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading-edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business. Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. I guess, the first question is kind of looking beyond 2024 and, obviously, don't expect you to provide any guidance there, but take any opinion that you have. Some of the other equipment suppliers that have had longer lead times were starting to express a little more confidence on a turn on '25. I don't expect that you've seen that in your order book yet, but interested to see what your customers may be talking about. It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long leads on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations.
But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be.
And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both reticle business but also is a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth as leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next 6 months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now. Got it. That's very helpful. As a start-up, with regard to the foundry/logic business, would you characterize, and I guess, what you talked about your WFE assumptions is some kind of slight growth this year. Is it safe to say that, that growth is either tied to new node deployments and kind of technology upgrades and such as opposed to capacity at this point? It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion in our capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially, the newest technologies. And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You talked about memory utilization remaining low. And, I guess, I feel like you guys kind of talked about that relatively early, and then you saw it kind of static. We've heard from memory customers, all kinds of things about different times that they brought it down and like some of them bought it up. I just want to confirm that you're seeing that as kind of a steady trend? And then can you talk about how that affects your the services revenue you can get from those guys? Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone right now. And so when we talked to them last year, it was -- there's a lot of [indiscernible] looks about -- because they had been ready for a much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than -- historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down the utilization on our systems have chosen not to.
And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year. The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So they take capacity offline for a process, they tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick's statement, it's been fairly flat overall.
And DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it's been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Bren, you talked about strategic alternatives for the display business. Can you help us out how big the display business was last year? And then in general, on the EPC business, there are kind of auto is starting to [indiscernible] mobility is getting better. Can you just talk about how you're looking at the EPC business, excluding display? You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display they are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher-end customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering.
The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of 2 businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging.
So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. ICOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity-centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half.
PCB has been more mobile-centric in terms of in more consumer markets more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high-end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023. Great. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about uncertainty in leading edge with some push out. If your foundry customers decide to focus more in putting these investments of fabs in Japan versus U.S. Is there an impact to your business? Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that.
So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year. Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. First off, I really just want to ask for some clarification about the service business expectation for calendar 2024. I think that you talked about higher forecasted growth in service. Is it higher than what you thought at the 12% to 14% this year? Or if you're just talking about higher growth than compared with your systems business? Just a quick clarification. Yes, more in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year.
But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So we'll be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins.
Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin. Maybe another question, maybe a little bit longer term. I think in the past, you talked about particularly some of your leading-edge customers reusing their capacity in the past and may put a little bit pressure a few cycles ago on your overall growth. Your largest customer, I think, last week, talked about maybe converting some of the 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer. We don't know whether they're going to continue to do that. But any thoughts there and looking a little bit ahead, do you expect any sort of negative impact going forward? The -- you're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to reuse whatever they could. There's a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is the technology that they're going to need for [ 3 ] and then for [ 2 ] is upgraded from what they have at [ 5 ].
And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be -- historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we've seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago.
But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there's nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Bren, I wanted to ask about book-to-bill. So it's below 1 for the fifth quarter in a row. It's up a little bit. It's up to like 0.9. So you're reaching some sort of like steady state. But it's a much different dynamic of what's sitting in RPO than what used to sit in backlog because you used to have 4 to 5 months worth of backlog.
And now if you assume half of the stuff is parked outside of 12 months and half is inside of 12 months, I mean it's not, I guess, that different than it was before, but you still have this $5 billion plus it's parked beyond 12 months and that was never there before. So as we look pre-COVID and post-COVID, what changed? Why is there this $5 billion worth of bookings or RPOs just parked beyond 12 months? Because it isn't like your lead times have gone out that far. And I understand that with those long lead times, but it has always been long lead times. So what's kind of changed for you? Yes. I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening. And so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out.
And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been [ cleaning ] up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you notice, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive.
So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter. Yes. Yes. I mean it was up, definitely. But I guess just my follow-up on that is what's the advantage? If I'm that customer and if your lead times are well inside of that, what's the advantage if I'm a Chinese customer to booking something that's kind of sit in your backlog it's -- but parked beyond 12 months? I mean, unless I'm worried about export control and maybe, I think, because I have something I've given you a down payment that entitles me to get the tool, like is that part of it? I still don't know why I would park something like way, way beyond your lead times? Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders.
So I think it comes down to you're one -- if you're one of those customers who want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. So -- and in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't our -- I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans. Well, that's a ton of customers that we actually never heard of before. Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I have 2 as well. The first one is on high NA. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect among some of your customers in terms of, I guess, their appetite to take tools and to develop using those tools. Curious, how you're thinking about your potential insertion of high NA over the medium to long term? And how should we think about the positive impact to your business from an intensity standpoint? Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for high NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of NA -- of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable in memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with -- the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features.
It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run. So you need to run, for example, a BBP tool at a higher sensitivity, which, as you know, requires -- we keep adding capability, but it does require more capacity to cover the same amount of silicon to support that. So it's a very good transfer for Process Control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now. That's very helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Bren. Just on the display business, so it's 1.5% of revenue last year. I'm curious if you could speak to the profitability of that business. I mean, to the extent you do end up, say, selling the business, how should we think about accretion to gross margins and bottom line earnings? Yes, profitability is less than 1.5 -- 1.5% of KLA. So it's 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA's profitability. [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you again, everyone, for your time. We know it's a busy day of earnings a busy week. We appreciate it. We'll be in touch with sure all of you over the coming days and weeks. And with that, back to you, Chelsea, to provide any final instructions. This concludes the KLA Corporation  December Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions].
I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Thank you for joining our earnings call to discuss the March 2024 results in the June quarter outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace; and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials.
Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references are to calendar years. Earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and linked to the SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosures of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin. Today, I will review KLA's March quarter results and highlights and address the new market share reports as well as a broader industry outlook.
KLA's revenue of $2.36 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range. EPS results, both non-GAAP and GAAP, were above the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided on March 18 in conjunction with the decision to exit the flat panel business.
Market conditions have stabilized, and we expect our business to improve as we progress through the year. We're encouraged by the improvement in our customers' business across multiple end markets, which is driving discussions with our customers about future opportunities for leading-edge capacity investments.
At the start of each year, new global market share reports are published by third parties that provide additional insights into the state of our industry. These reports show consistent long-term KLA market leadership in process control and demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio that offers our customers unique capabilities to address their technology challenges while meeting their productivity demands. This year, following significant gain in 2022, KLA's 2023 market share declined by nearly 1%, driven primarily by a loss in access to approximately 10% of the China market as a result of U.S. government export controls.
That said, KLA's consistent market leadership and process control and some of the most critical markets in WFE reflect the success of our customer-focused strategies and the power of our portfolio. We're confident that KLA's quarterly revenues bottomed in the March quarter as expressed in our prior earnings call.
In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and slowly rising capital intensity continue to be a long-term tailwind. Additionally, the increasing complexity in advanced packaging applications for AI and other advanced technologies drive demand for both our process tool and process control products. Overall demand growth, along with increasing technology requirements will drive the need for more capability from inspection and metrology systems.
Our advanced packaging business will generate approximately $400 million in run rate in 2024, and we expect this business to achieve growth rates meaningfully above the growth rate of WFE going forward.
In services, our business grew to $590 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Quarterly free cash flow was $838 million, and the last 12 months free cash flow was $3.1 billion with a free cash flow margin of 32% over the period.
KLA's quarterly results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and product strategies. Customers continue to prioritize and invest in leading-edge technology transition and this aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product road maps and preparing for growth at the leading edge. Bren will now discuss the financials and our outlook further. Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated a consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show [ resourcefullness ] and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.36 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.3 billion.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.26, above the guidance midpoint of $4.83. The GAAP diluted EPS was $4.43, above the guidance midpoint of $4.06. In the March quarter, both non-GAAP and GAAP diluted EPS were negatively impacted by a $62 million charge for excess and obsolete inventory related to the company's strategic decision to exit the flat panel display business announced on March 18. This charge had a $0.40 impact on EPS. Excluding this item, diluted non-GAAP EPS would have been $5.66.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, above the top end of the revised guidance range. Excluding the FPD charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 62.4% and roughly flat sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $544 million comprised of $320 million in R&D and $224 million in SG&A.  Non-GAAP EPS at the 13.5% guided tax rate would have been $0.04 higher or $5.30. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36.8%. Non-GAAP other income and expense net was a $34 million expense and the quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $715 million, GAAP net income was $602 million. Cash flow from operations was $910 million, and free cash flow was $838 million.
The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. On February 1, KLA issued $500 million of 4.7% senior notes due in 2034 and $250 million of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052. The -- the company expects to use the net proceeds from the notes operating for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at or prior to maturity.
Moving to our outlook. We remain encouraged by constructive customer discussions around their future investment plans, which are further supported by recent reports of an improving end market demand environment and customer profitability. Consistent with these industry trends,  as we indicated last quarter, we believe our business bottomed from a revenue perspective in the March quarter and looking ahead through the balance of calendar '24, growth is resuming in the June quarter, and we expect business levels to improve as we progress through the year.
For calendar 2024, our high-level outlook remains unchanged. We still expect WFE demand to be roughly flat to modestly up from 2023 and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows: revenue of $2.5 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry/logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 82% and memory is expected to be 18% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 78% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 22%.
Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in the range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point based on product mix expectations. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling non-GAAP gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the June quarter to be approximately $550 million as our merit adjustment process occurred in the March quarter. .
Looking ahead, we continue to expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024, supported by expected revenue growth.
Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately $38 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $5.66, plus or minus $0.60. And a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.07, plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.4 million shares.
In conclusion, as we articulated 12 weeks ago, we are encouraged with the indicators of improvement ranging from our customers' conversations to the public reports over the past few months. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology road map requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance.
With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield across the high semiconductor device design mix, volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook as near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve.
In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact in both legacy and leading-edge markets. That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. Thank you, Bren. Operator, can you please provide instructions for [indiscernible]. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Last year and first half of this year was more mature node by spending maybe more infrastructure focused as well. As you step into the second half of this year, it does feel like advanced momentum is starting to accelerate, rate, both foundry and logic and memory and appears to be reflected in your confidence on improving spending outlook for this calendar year. Given your relatively longer lead time, your critical role in enabling these advanced technology migrations. Like how are customer discussions the initial forecast visibility and outlook for calendar '25 shaping up for the team. I mean I assume it's a more advanced technology-driven profile next year, which should be good for the team, but wanted to get your views. Great. Harlan, thanks for the question. This is Rick. Absolutely, we are having different kind of discussions now than we've had for a while with our leading-edge logic and memory customers. As they prepare for the ramp and we're seeing increased demand for -- they are seeing increased demand, they're talking about tool availability, scheduling of resources, making sure that they don't get behind, really conversations we haven't had for a while. I think the build-outs are still -- as we indicated, we see kind of stability with rising demand through the year, but the real build-out is going to come in '25 and beyond that as we see some of the conversations we're having.
So really good indicators, leading indicators, design starts, advanced node discussions, R&D work. So we feel pretty good about the setup. Great. And did you see the continued growth in the services business with industry utilization is clearly on an upward trajectory. You've got record number of tools coming off warranty customers, I think, wanting more value-added services and offerings just given the complexity challenges ahead? Has the view on the services growth profile improved relative to the last earnings call? I know you talked about being at the upper end of that sort of 12% to 14% sort of target range this year on the last call. Has that changed? I would say -- Harlan, it's Bren. I would say, look, we're continuing to see very strong momentum utilization rates are improving. We had a lot of tools come off of warranty, and they go into contract and our conversion rate is about 95%. So that's very positive. Customers are extending lives of the systems, which bodes well for long-term service growth overall. So I think as we track here, I think we feel pretty good about the range that we have, and we're closer to the upper end for sure than the lower end as we move forward over the next few years. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. I guess first question, a near-term question on the mix you expect for June, which a pretty massive shift to time logic from memory. So I guess as part of that, can you speak to some of the underlying drivers? And within that, do you see perhaps a pickup from domestic China memory beyond the June quarter? Or I think in the prior quarter, you talked about revenue rec pushed to the June quarter. So curious about the moving parts there. Yes. I would say as far as China memory goes, it's more first half heavy than second half, while we're having very positive conversations with our customers on the memory front, as Rick indicated, in terms of long-term plans, we're seeing their businesses now improve. We're seeing profitability and cash flow starting to improve. But we don't expect any significant investments as we move through the rest of the year. Nothings could change. But I think that the profile, it might tick up a little bit in the second half overall, non-China but I don't see it changing in a real meaningful way.
If you look back at our business, we were a little bit over 70%, maybe logic/foundry in 2023. And I think we're going to be right around 70%. I think it's going to be a pretty similar overall mix this year. Excellent. And then in terms of your commentary around accelerating top line revenues throughout the remainder of calendar '24. I guess can you speak to the main drivers there as it relates to perhaps 2-nanometer pilot, logic in Arizona. -- handset-related EPC. What's really driving that? And is there sort of a percentage growth rate we should be thinking about half-on-half? Yes. C.J., I think you covered most of them, right? We will see some early investment in 2-nanometer. You have the 3-nanometer build-out. You have the investment that you mentioned in Arizona. So those are all pretty good for the logic/foundry segment. Right now, when I look at the overall business first half versus second half, I think the second half is high single digits versus the first half in that ballpark.  We're not guiding, but I think it's going to end up in that range as we progress through the year.
On the EPC front, I think it is a little bit stronger. You do have some seasonality in EPC in the first part of the year. But we'll see some improvement there, I think, as we move through the second half of the year as well. And of course, service is growing quarter-on-quarter. So you've got that effect as well. And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Two of them. One is [indiscernible] last quarter, you kind of said that for KLA, the overall calendar '24 revenues could grow mid-single digits based on WFE. And obviously, some of these expectation [indiscernible] going to be higher thanks to [indiscernible]. Given that you do have some exposure on that side. I'm just kind of curious how to think about your overall revenue profile for this year -- year-over-year? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. So -- and when you look at the WFE level, we talked about flat to modestly up. And that, I think, depends on your view of WFE as everybody adds it up differently. Our view is that WFE was probably $90 billion to $91 billion, and then it's slightly up from there or flat to slightly up from there in terms of how we're looking at this year.
So I think that's the way to think about it. It simply put, given the WFE is more or less flat to modestly up, that we were going to see this increase in service that we've talked about. We're going to see some modest improvement in EPC. And we've seen some improvement given the outperformance we saw in March, the incremental guide into June in our semi PC business.
So I think overall, semi EPC share in the overall market is probably going to be fairly consistent, maybe a little bit up from what we saw in '23. And all that translates into our semi EPC business roughly performing mostly in line with where we think the market is going to be for this year. Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on China.  Give you a long lead time, so I'm kind of curious how do you think about China -- you did say memory would be filtrated overall China revenues? And along the same path, if I [indiscernible] gross margins from March to June is down 90 basis points Q-over-Q. You said it's product mix? Is it mainly from China? I'm just kind of curious on this. Yes. No, it's mostly product mix quarter-on-quarter, down from the FPD adjustment related to the inventory that we took related to the decision there. So it's mostly just product mix across our semi PC business. You do have some growth in service quarter-on-quarter and services is dilutive to the overall gross margin. We believe it's accretive to the operating margin, but the gross margin is a little dilutive. And then the rest is just the normal product mix we have across the portfolio. Different margin profiles across the portfolio. And so depending on what we're revenue in a given quarter, it can cause some fluctuation. .
But I think the guidance range is appropriate, like we saw -- I think we guided somewhere around 61.5% last quarter. It came in above 62%, depending on how things end up revenuing as we engage with customers and ship systems. There's always room for upside, which is why we give the range that we give.
So there's nothing really particular to actual customers. It's more about the product mix of all regions. It's more about the product mix of the products we're shipping and getting acceptance . [indiscernible] for the rest of the year, similar range or? So China is interesting. I think it's probably flattish over the course of the year. Second half is more or less flattish with the first half. The mix is changing a bit in terms of the end market mix. But we see it as a percent of the total come down as we see most of the growth in the year coming from our non-China customers. We'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel. I [indiscernible] few questions. I guess, is sort of asked earlier, but with all these chips announcements continuing to roll in, has this solidified the timing or magnitude of any of the U.S. greenfields to build out -- or maybe what is your latest thinking on some of these projects? Well, yes, there have been many announcements. It's exciting to see. But when you look at the timing for those projects, even, for example, the 1 that was announced today in New York, that one's quite a ways out. So I think the approval of the funding relative to the timing, the customers we talk to, they're excited about this, the chance to reshore under the U.S., but they're still building their capacity based on market demand. So it doesn't really affect the overall capacity investment. They're gauging that based on the overall demand. And I think what happens is -- it's the size of the investment in terms of how many wafer starts to [indiscernible] and what point is driven by the market.
So we'd stick to the comments about when the -- what we see for the business environment relatively independent of what location that the customers are choosing to make those investments. Got it. That's fair. And then maybe I did notice that in the shareholder letter and on the call, you highlighted advanced packaging revenue could be around $400 million in calendar '24, what growth rate does that represent versus calendar '23? And then how would you size your served addressable market in advanced packaging, which I know certainly cross is, I guess, boundaries across your portfolio? Yes. So it's greater than 25%. So we're somewhere down in around [indiscernible] in '23. -- a little over [ $300 ] and close to $400 million expectation for '24. It's across a broad portfolio, right? We have process control, which we sell to those customers, which is inspection of metrology, but also process tools in our specialty semiconductor business. It's about 50-50 in terms of the contribution from each part of the portfolio. And I think on the go forward, we feel pretty excited about the opportunity to see a growth rate that's meaningfully faster than WFE. Yes. And I think for opportunity, there's a couple of factors that are at play. One is the speed with which customers are accelerating their packaging efforts. The degree with which those are requiring leading edge. Our ability to make it make sense from a business standpoint, the packaging challenges really need to be leading edge. So there's still a number of packaging applications that are in markets that are served by lower-end competitors that we're not really competing for. So it has to do with how quickly the new technologies come on, but this has been an increased conversation in meetings that we've been having with leading customers for the last year or so, it was already talked about, but it's accelerating.
So I think it's hard to judge exactly what the growth rate will be at this point. But it's pretty clear that there's a huge demand. And for many customers, they view it as the competitive necessity in order to -- there's very much of a race of getting that new capability into the market, especially as it pertains to some of the AI applications. So I would say that it's a huge driver for our customers. We're engaged. There's a lot of requests for new capability and some of it comes down to us developing solutions in conjunction with those customers to meet those demands. But on its own as it stands right now, it will outgrow WFE and we think it has the potential to go well beyond that, depending on how the adoption goes and how we continue to execute against it. We'll take our next question from Tim Arcuri with UBS. I wanted to ask about N2, Rick. So -- there has been a lot of talk recently about the big volume in for N2 is not going to be probably until '26, although there will certainly be some customers -- crypto customers and whatnot that will ramp in '25. So there will be capacity that gets installed next year. So I guess my question is, how much of a driver do you think N2 will specifically be for your business. Are you seeing any of that yet? Is it more in the back half of this year thing? Is that -- so I'm just asking about like timing, when that starts to help your business? Yes. Great question. It is definitely being 1 of the conversations we're having with critical customers about timing. And we have seen -- part of our optimism going forward is those conversations are being pulled in, in terms of the needs because our customers are feeling end market pull. So I think you're right that it's -- the bulk of it -- the highest volume will be in '26. But for KLA we're already seeing those conversations, and we'll start to see some meaningful business in '25 for that with orders coming toward the end of '24 as customers figure it out.
The other thing is we're seeing a number of advanced design starts for the 2-nanometer node. It's a big -- as you know, Tim, it's a big power favorable node. And so for a lot of customers, some of the challenges around data center and frankly, around AI are power related in terms of customers being able to even build those sites -- so it's a big driver for our customers right now. So we think N2 is going to be a very significant node, and we're going to definitely see a lot of that. We're already seeing the activity, but it will be a big factor in '25 and then as we go through '25. Got it. Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then I want to ask about China, Bren, you just said, I think you said China is going to be flattish sort of in the back half of the year. I mean it sounds like every quarter, China keeps getting stronger and [indiscernible] think it's going to downtick and it doesn't because -- you're just going to take tools of loans -- they're allowed to take tools. So my question is really just on the mix around China. Is this -- is the back half going in a bit because of new customers? I mean there's all be 30 or 40 new has been built, if not more than that, that are part of these [indiscernible] names.
And so is it these newly named fabs that are coming on that are sort of filling in the back half of the year? And then if we've seen a lot of headlines around potential entity list additions, if this happens, which there's been a lot of headlines about it. But if it does happen, -- is this downside to what you're thinking for the back half of the year or for next year? Well, Tim, I don't want to speculate about hypotheticals about what might come or not come from the U.S. government in regards to further export controls, and we're continuing to work very closely with the government and spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that whatever the rules are that we're were compliant. It's a pretty decent mix. I talked about DRAM being down. I think the wafer infrastructure in the second half -- I think the wafer infrastructure is probably down a little bit in the second half. I think the [indiscernible] infrastructure is probably up -- and then the logic/foundry is up overall. And when you net it all out, it's basically a flattish profile.
The customer mix, you have -- you do have a number of new projects continuing to take systems, but you also have the -- I'll call them, the more mature legacy customers in China that are also part of that mix. So I think it's continuing to be healthy, I think, through this year. And I think the profile as we -- even beyond this year feels like it kind of continues more or less at current levels. Obviously, those are like half to half [indiscernible] mean in any given quarter, we'll see some movement. But that's how we see things today. We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham . I want to ask a question to build on what was discussed with the team earlier. So TSMC definitely said that the revenue is going to ramp in 2026 for N2. And you kind of alluded to that, that you think the '26 volume for you will be higher than '25. But if I look at how the 30-nanometer ramp look like? And it occurs to me that 2022, which was 1 year in terms of production time line for the 3-nanometer was a higher volume for you guys compared with probably 2023. So I just really wonder the fact that you said you think [indiscernible] will be a high volume for you compared with '25? Was that coming from some discussion with the customers? And what's changed this time, why they want the kind of I mean, move the capacity to a little bit closer to the high volume at the point of entry to the high-volume production? Yes, it's a great question. And there's a couple of things to consider when thinking about N2. First of all, this is now very clear in our customers' minds a race for AI capability. And so you see several design starts happening, not just the ones we're most familiar with, but other players too design for capability. So you have a very different demand environment. .
You also have a constrained capacity environment now constrained somewhat even by the ability to build facilities. But the last factor is you have the KLA phenomenon as we get pulled in early. So we're front-end loaded into some of these facilities because you need our systems to be able to qualify the rest. So it is a different node than what we've seen in quite a while because of those factors. And there -- as we meet with customers, they are very concerned about supporting the demand that they're seeing. That's why we believe we're going to get a lot of pressure to support the end of this calendar year to start supporting some of the POs that we're going to see as they plan out those nodes, and it will go through -- and we're talking about volume in '26 for them, but toward the end of '25 is when we'll be seeing more and more of that business.
And of course, we don't know how much broader it's going to get in terms of the number of design starts. It is remarkable that there are these many designs specifically for 1 application at this point in the process, but it's pretty remarkably consistent as we talk to different customers and even their customers. Maybe a second question, I want to ask you about the advanced packaging capability [indiscernible] building there, sounds like you're having more of the constructive conversation with your customers maybe to put more of the KLA more advanced [indiscernible] control capabilities into the packaging side of the process control. So I get the overall idea, but just really hope for you to provide a little bit more color, what kind of areas do you think the customers are facing challenges in terms of maybe ramping up [indiscernible], maybe wrapping up SOIC -- and where do you see from process control perspective, the biggest opportunities for KLA? Yes. I'll give you some color just from 2 stories. One, years ago when we bought IQOS, part of the theory of that case was it was giving us exposure to the back end. And I remember meeting with 1 of our big customers and their back-end people, and they literally said to me, why are you guys talking to us about the back end, that's not a KLA market. And fast forward to the end of last year, calendar year in a meeting that [indiscernible] and I had with a critical customer, they had 2 topics that we need to talk about. One was our support of EUV and the ramping of -- continuous ramping of EUV designs and capabilities and the other was advanced packaging. And these are the folks that were historically and traditionally responsible for the front end. And 1 of the things I said is we think you guys have the capability in a lot of your front-end tools that we need that modified [indiscernible] for the back end because the back end is a critical part of our differentiation, and that's the part that we need you to work with us to take what you consider front-end tools and make it. And what we're more concerned with than cost and this is often the case at the beginning of a note. They're more concerned with capability and then they were necessarily on cost.
So the dynamic has shifted pretty considerably. And again, I go to 1 of the biggest drivers for all this is all the work that's going on with AI. And if you look at the success and the requirement to have advanced packaging as part of those solutions, that's what's driving it. So we kind of anticipated a few years ago this more than more trend was going to become more and more relevant. But we're seeing it very specifically with customers bringing front-end people that they've worked in the front end, having them work on these back-end challenges and asking specifically for capability that we have in the front end to be used in the back end. And in some cases, we've done that with some of our inspection tools and capability. But as you know, we have to make modifications to handling and some of the operating conditions to make that work.
So we're definitely seeing that, and in some cases, our ability to support and modify those systems will be the gating item for us to realize revenue on it, not the demand. The demand is there. And from a competitive standpoint, we're uniquely positioned to do that. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity, and it's a major focus area for the company. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Just a follow-up question with regards to memory. And I think I understand what you're saying with regard to this year, perhaps some improvement in non-China memory, but nothing significant. I guess, what are your customers telling you to be prepared for perhaps as you're going into next year. We're starting to see some prices go up, utilization up. What's your expectation for the potential improvement in '25? Yes, Chris, you're seeing all the things you want to see, right? You're seeing pricing improve, customers are taking up utilization. Utilizations were very low. And so there's a fair amount of capacity that's been out there. We're seeing the profitability improve and ultimately, that will translate into cash flow and then what we expect to be investment next year.
I think we're seeing more in DRAM driven by the leading edge of DRAM or expect to see more there. And then, of course, the drivers related to high bandwidth memory. But I think in some ways, it's the device market -- part of the market is improving this year, and that will translate into investment next year. Got it. As a follow-up, with regard to service, I think last quarter, you talked about your expectation that being kind of the high end of a 12% to 14% target. Is that still the right way of thinking about it? Again, we've seen utilization rates improve here. Does that make that change your view of where services come out for the year? Well, it's certainly a factor in the growth that we're seeing this year. So I've been pretty open that I thought that we'd be somewhere between $250 million to $300 million of incremental service this year versus in 2023. And I think we're closer to the top end of that range than the bottom. So it is a factor. And given the nature of process control and the complexity of our systems, the mix and the relatively lower volume, our customers tend to rely on us to ensure that they're optimizing their capital, particularly in environments when capital is constrained. -- yields matter a lot. And so our utilizations never dropped as much as process tools where they have more redundancy, but we are seeing it continue to improve. And so I think it's a good sign in terms of the overall market health and our confidence about  some of the growth drivers into next year. We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Wondering if you could comment, obviously, you seem pretty positive in terms of just the opportunity looking into next year and thinking about the size of N2 and recovery in the memory market, I guess, how does the conversation with your customers over the last several months and just thinking about your lead times to give you confidence in your ability to reach that 2026 target model? Well, I think our confidence is pretty good. We've made a lot of investments around the company in '21 and '22, both in terms of our own capacity, but also to ensure that our key suppliers have the capacity to support that kind of demand environment. So we -- it's 1 of the reasons why my inventory levels today are higher than -- and they continue to grow even where the market has corrected some because of the commitments we've made to ensure that the suppliers keep that capacity in place.
So we feel very good about our ability to leverage what we have. I don't think we really have to make a lot of big investments to be able to support that trajectory. And I think we'll -- because of the investments, I think, frankly, they're a little bit of a headwind today in terms of the margins. So I think over time, the leverage opportunity is also compelling if we see the kind of growth environment that we expect over the next couple of years. Okay. As a quick follow-up, Bren, I was wondering if you could give us RPO exiting the quarter? It wouldn't be a quarterly conference call without your question, Joe. So 9.9-ish, -- we're going to file the [indiscernible] in the morning or sometime tomorrow, I think, $9.9 billion. It was down about $750 million quarter-on-quarter. Deposits are about $677 million. We will take our next question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. I think there's been a lot of discussion on the call about advanced packaging, and you guys have talked about how you had conversations already about potentially bringing some of your solutions from the front end to the back end. There's obviously some adjustments to those tools to get them ready. Can you talk about the timing of bringing those solutions there? Obviously, you're seeing a big growth rate in the back end. But from the moment that you say, hey, we want to take a tool and address the back end to when you're actually selling that to a customer. Can you talk about how long that takes? Sure. And we had -- yes, let's be clear. I mean we have some of our products already from the front end that are being used in the back end. That started a while ago. We're just seeing an accelerated conversation about more tools where some customers will actually name specific tools that they want. So it very much depends on the tool -- and I can give you a range where it could be from 3 months, it could be a couple of years depending on whether you're modifying something that's already being used in that kind of application and specializing it. So it really depends. But I do think that -- we have some that are already there. So part of our [indiscernible] from tools that were from the front end of the amount of -- probably half of those actually and some are process capabilities from SPTS.
So it's really -- those are examples where we have it. And then -- also the case is some of those tools need to be upgraded to the later specifications as customers move forward in technology. So that's why, net-net, it's a positive. It's a growth segment for us. We think it will continue to grow. Bren talked about the growth from last year, and it was a big driver for going back in time for the [indiscernible] acquisition was our belief that packaging opportunity was going to continue to grow. So that's where we are on it. But it's very tool-specific how long it takes to [indiscernible]. We also have new products that are going to support the substrate transition as the substrate integrates into the package. On the inspection side as the lines and spaces shrink and in the connecting layers. It will drive the need for more capability for more advanced inspection and metrology systems -- and so any time you add sensitivity, you add capability, there tends to be a throughput or a volume hit, so it creates an opportunity for us to sell higher ASP systems so they have more capability, but if you're going to maintain the same sampling rate, then you will need more systems. So it's all a factor in terms of all these factors are all positive in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunities. Super helpful. And then my second 1 is just kind of on the [ TBT ] that you've given for the year. So you said second half over first half, high single digits. -- and you talked about kind of the mix of foundry/logic being similar to calendar year '23, about that 70%. If you take those clues, you obviously see some really strong growth in memory in the second half. Could you just help us with any color, obviously, March to June, your DRAM percentage went down a bit in terms of its contribution to memory. But in the second half, how should we be thinking about the DRAM and NAND growth profile? Yes. I think I don't think it's going to -- it will be a little bit stronger potentially in the second half than the first, but not much because like I said earlier that [indiscernible] expected DRAM investments in China, I would expect in the second half to be lower than the first half. [Operator Instructions] I'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Sorry, I joined a little late, so if these questions have already been asked, I apologize. But I think last quarter, Bren, you had a customer push out that kind of impacted your revenue for the year. I'm just wondering if there's any change or any update to that customer if you're including that in the current year's guidance? Yes, it affected the March quarter as we had some shifting around, frankly, affected a little bit in the December quarter and the March quarter, but the shifting around to make the December quarter work, obviously, the shortfall was in March. So I don't think anything has really changed. I don't expect to see much activity from that customer until we get into '25. I mean, look, things could change. We could see some surprise. But right now, at least from a planning point of view, we put it in '25, and [indiscernible] great, we can support it. Got it. And then -- on the 2 nanometer, I think your foundry customers are transitioning aggressively into it get all around. Obviously, that helps you -- but at the same time, I think the [ EUV ] layer count is going to be somewhat flattish. So I'm just wondering what sort of impact kind of it will have on process control intensity if you go to GA and keep the, I guess, EUV kind of flattish in terms of layers, -- should we expect any impact? Or is it kind of a nonevent for you? It's an event. I mean, our customers are definitely -- so you think about the dynamic, our customers don't want to add process control intensity if they can avoid it, they also want to ramp and yield. So those are the -- that's the trade-off. So in the prototyping stage or the early pilot, they inspect more and they measure more in order to debug the process, if you will, and ramp it. And the question is how much do they have to maintain when they ramp and that's really what drives process control. They're definitely using more capability at the front end and there are some areas where they're going to have to increase their sampling or measurement to keep up with the additional challenges of smaller design role. And there's also some new capability to have to bring because of FinFET. And so we've talked in the past about modifications of a Gen 4 optical inspector to be able to support the FinFET. But it's not the only change in that process.
So the EUV layers matter, but the process integration challenges are still going to be there. When we model it, though we do see an increase, we have different scenarios for how much process control intensity will go up. But it's consistent with -- we think there'll be a modest increase in the overall process control intensity for the leaders who have been successfully doing [indiscernible]. Anybody else that tries to jump to that node though, we'll see a dramatic increase in their process control intensity because they don't benefit from the learning of having done [indiscernible] volume.
So in aggregate, depending on how many people are supporting it over time, it will drive our intensity up for our customers.
We're also expecting a more robust design environment, certainly in the first few years than what we saw at 3-nanometer and likely a steeper ramp. So in addition to the challenges of just the gate-all-around architecture, what it means from inspection but also metrology, but also more volume earlier, steeper ramp and a more robust design environment, which will challenge the customers' process integration more than you see when you just have a few designs. So we're encouraged on a number of fronts. We'll take another question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Rick, I just had a follow-up on gate all around. Clearly, you have exposure to your Gen4 optical inspection and the metrology for High-K Metal gave. Is the way to quantify what you think your gate all around revenues could be in calendar '24? Yes. I'd be making it up, Chris. I mean we haven't -- we don't really look at it that. We do think about what is the node requirement. So from that standpoint, if you think 2, you attribute it all to gate all around. So we think about node intensity for process control and blended. And as I said in the prior answer, that's slightly up, but we don't have a specific number specifically around [indiscernible] all round. But obviously, that's the big driver the change and why customers are pushing for N2. And we don't know yet, but that's consistent with the 2026 model that we've had where we see rising process control intensity corresponding increase per share for KLA. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just like if I could squeeze 1 more in. Just kind of curious about your Gen 4 lead times. I think last time we said is like 7 to 9 months. Has it changed? If you assume that [indiscernible] is kind of slowing, China might moderate as the year progresses. Is there a view that the lead times are coming in? Or is it still like 7 to 9 months? Gen 4 is highly demanded across nodes. It's a very configurable system. And in fact, we recently entered a non-upgradable version specifically for gate all around.  So, it's a product that has a lot of extendability. It's been challenged in terms of supply, the ability to get supply to meet demand. I would say -- and we will see some increase this year in revenue from that system, which [indiscernible] last year just because we weren't able to get any incremental supply key components.
I'll see that increase this year. And so that will help. I still think lead times are probably in the 18- to 24-month range for that product, although we do a lot of [indiscernible] to make sure that we're in a position to support all of our customers. But it has demand on multiple fronts, and I think it's a testament to its extendability and the favorability of a broadband system, which has the ability to scale [indiscernible] it plans to meet very different inspection requirements across multiple nodes. Thank you, Krish. And I do think, Krish, you were referring to what we said about Gen 5, the 7 to 9 months a quarter ago, Bren. So I don't know on Gen 5, if there's any change [indiscernible] Gen 5 is in the same ballpark [indiscernible] .
All right. So that brings us to the end of our call. We want to thank everyone for your time and attention. We know it's a very busy day. With that, I will pass the call back over to our operator, to conclude. This does conclude the KLA Corporation March 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the June 2024 results and the September quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available at ir.kla.com along with supplemental materials.
Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified, all full year references are to calendar years. The earnings materials containing a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. Let me turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? Thank you, Kevin. I will cover a few business highlights for this quarter. KLA's June quarter revenue, gross margin and EPS were all above their respective guidance midpoints. Quarter played out mostly as expected with strong customer demand and solid company execution. We continue to see signs of the strengthening market environment for customers at the leading edge and remain confident in our plan for steady improvement throughout the remainder of this calendar year and into 2025.
This quarter, KLA results returned to sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating an improving industry environment. Foundry/logic continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies and slowly rising capital intensity continues to be a long-term tailwind. In memory, technology development investments for the AI high-bandwidth memory and the improving supply-demand environment, support an expected return to growth for memory markets in 2025.
The June quarter also marked another quarter of strong performance from our portfolio of broadband plasma or BBP products, which we also refer to as Gen 4 and Gen 5. This year marks 4 years of innovation for our BBP patterned wafer inspection business. We continue to see significant differentiation keeping this product line at the forefront of the discovery for the semiconductor industry. We expect this product family momentum to continue delivering strong relative growth performance in calendar year 2024.
AI continues to be a driver and enabler for KLA's business. AI adoption is driving higher volume in wafer manufacturing, more complex designs, larger die and chip size and growing advanced packaging demands, which supported an increase in process control intensity. Last quarter, we estimated that the KLA opportunity would reach approximately $400 million in annualized revenue, exiting calendar 2024. Today, we're raising that estimate to more than $500 million in total advanced packaging revenue across the entire KLA portfolio on the momentum we are experiencing.
Additionally, AI is enabling KLA to further differentiate our products and the continuous improvement in the performance of our systems.
Daily service business grew to $614 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Utilization rates of existing installed capacity are steadily rising across all business segments as end market demand improves. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $832 million. The last 12 months free cash flow was $3 billion, with free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. Daily results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio specific product strategies. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on progress road maps and preparing for growth at the leading edge.
I'll now hand the call over to Bren to go through the financial highlights and outlook. Thanks, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated our market leadership combined with the consistent execution of our global team. KLA continues to serve resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customers' changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.57 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.60 and GAAP diluted EPS was $6.18, both above their respective guidance midpoints. Gross margin was 62.5% at the upper end of the guidance range as a richer product mix than model and higher revenue volume growth upside to guidance.
Operating expenses were $553 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $324 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41%. Other income and expense net was a $32 million expense and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.6%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $893 million, GAAP net income was $836 million, cash flow from operations was $893 million, and free cash flow was $832 million. The company had 135.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 major rating agencies. Moving to our outlook. We believe our business is transitioning from a period of stabilization to a resumption of growth, which began in our June quarter, and we expect to continue through the remainder of calendar '24 and into 2025.
For calendar 2024, we remain encouraged by the improvement in our customers' revenue and profitability over the course of this year. This improvement will ultimately translate into new investment in capital equipment to support semiconductor growth over the medium term. Our high-level outlook for the industry remains largely unchanged. Our expectation is for the WFE market to be in the mid-$90 million range and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half.
While it's too early to be overly specific on expectations for calendar 2025, we do expect a year of growth through principally by growth in leading-edge investments in both logic/foundry and in memory. Given KLA's business momentum, we are confident in our relative performance opportunities moving forward. Daily September quarter guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be $2.75 billion, plus or minus $150 million; foundry/logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 80%; and memory is expected to be approximately 20% of semi process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 83% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 17%.
Gross margin is forecasted to be in the range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, as higher revenue volumes offset by weaker anticipated product mix. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on the current industry outlook, top line growth expectations for calendar '24, higher forecasted growth in services and expected system product mix, we are still modeling non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.
Operating expenses are forecasted in the September quarter to be approximately $565 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Look ahead, we expect approximately $10 million to $15 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar '24 and into 2025. This is supported by our revenue growth expectations and in line with our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin business model.
Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $34 million expense, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $6.69, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135 million shares.
In conclusion, our business has transitioned from a period of stabilization to one of growth. We remain optimistic that the indicators of improvement we have seen will continue throughout the remainder of calendar '24 and into 2025. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology road map requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations.
With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently.
Return of scaling and increasing complexity has solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control in enabling technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to result in process integration and fab ramp, but also in optimizing yield across the volume production environment with high semiconductor device design mix. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook, as near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A. Thank you, Bren. Operator, we're ready for you to provide instructions and begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Rick, recently, TSMC said they expect the number of new tape, after 2-nanometer in the first 2 years, to be higher than what they saw for 3 and 5 in their first 2 years. And I think they've also heard a number of AI customers accelerate their road maps. I'm curious, what does this mean for KLA in terms of your outlook and kind of your share of the WFE wallet? And do you expect 2-nanometer to be a bigger factor for 2025 or for 2026? Thanks, Vivek. Yes, we're definitely having those same conversations with our customers in terms of in the reticle world, of course, when there are more design starts, we see activity in the reticle market in terms of inspection for those reticles and then early lots we're still early in them to. 
And in terms of your question, it's really going into '25 and then '26. But the other thing we've seen is strengthening in M3 as well. So I think both of those factors are being driven by some of the same drivers we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of what we're seeing from AI driving that. So it does lead us to believe that our goal is to increase our percent of WFE continue to be supported by the opportunities afforded by the additional process control challenges. So I think we're in pretty good shape with that.
The other thing, of course, it's being driven in some of these advanced AI chips is larger die size, which as you know, are a bigger challenge from a yield perspective and creates more incentive for more inspection, especially as these processes are brought online and ramped up. So most of what we see is it's '25 leading into '26 in terms of when they reach HPM. Bren, anything to add? No, I think the -- you cover most of it, Rick. I would say also one of the things that we're encouraged by that with the design start environment, given the high mix of parts, that our participation with our customers in terms of process control is monitoring that happens in production tends to be at a higher level. So they're trying to manage a robust design environment that's testing design rules in different ways, and that tends to be positive for continuous process control investment as they ramp the node. Remember, Vivek, earlier in the year, we talked about a more positive tone we are seeing from our customers. And it was related to the early demand that they were starting to sense from their customers. And that's why we believe, and that's how it's playing out that we would see strengthening in our business. Maybe what's new -- a little bit new is the strength -- additional strength in M3, which wasn't as forecasted as the rollout of M2. So I think both of those are adding to our belief that we're in a good period for consistent acceleration in demand on the leading edge. Got it. Now on advanced packaging, you raised it from $400 million to $500 million. I wanted to clarify, is that on an exiting full year basis? Or is that for the full year? So just that clarification then how would you break it out in terms of specialty and inspection metrology? Yes, it's a good question. So that's our expectation for the business level in 2024. So it isn't a run rate necessarily, but what we expect to do, which is significantly above what we did last year, which was closer to $300 million. So mid-60% growth rate with continuing momentum. I would think that we would continue at least through the first half of next year to see strong demand around packaging. So it's really an opportunity for us.
Certainly, we're seeing a lot of customer interest as we're seeing more and more focus on broadband capability moving into the back end. So it's an encouraging opportunity moving forward. I think the growth rate relative to the growth rate of WFE will be higher over the next few years. 
So one of the things, Vivek, I'm sure you've heard is that, one of the bottlenecks now for AI is silicon is part of it, but the packaging [come off] is also part of what we're seeing. And we had customers for the first time in my career from the front end start pulling us into packaging conversations because they want front-end capability, as Bren said, being used in packaging to assist. So I think we talked about AI being a driver, it's really driving not just the silicon but also packaging and also, of course, HPM for -- you need all 3 of those to fully execute on the plans people have.
So to your question on mix, about, I'd say 60% of it is process control. And then you have the remaining 40% is in our process -- specialty process business and also some exposure in terms of chemical process control as well. About 60% of it in the classic semiconductor process control part of our business. . We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. In your prepared remarks, you talked about returning to growth for memory in 2025. I know it's early, but would love to hear kind of your initial thoughts and maybe separating DRAM versus NAND? And then within DRAM, how you're seeing HBM conversion versus DDR5 and greenfields? And same for NAND, later accounts questions, any sort of expectations for greenfield in the 2025 time frame? Well, 2024 is really a transition year for memory. We're not seeing a lot of growth overall. Some in the DRAM front and some investment that's happened in China. So I think from a WFE point of view, 2025 is when we expect to see more growth there. I think that you talked about the drivers, particularly around DRAM and HBM being drivers into next year. I think as we see our customers' business models improve, and we're certainly seeing the financial performance improved with pricing going up so significantly over the course of this year. But that will translate into investment as we move into next year. I think on the flash market, we're less bullish into next year, although it's operating off a pretty low level. We'll see as we get closer to it. But right now, we do see a recovery in both parts of it, but certainly led by more DRAM than flash on an absolute WFE basis.
Yes. And I think much like some of what we saw in the early discussions of AI last year where we didn't really see an increase in silicon because there was still utilization leverage that our customers have. Some of that's in memory. So we really don't see capacity starting to be added significantly until '25 and into '26 on HBM. So as Brent said, conversion, but then you don't get the capacity later, and it's really HBM associated DRAM before you see flash. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, again, in the prepared remarks, you talked about confidence in your relative performance. And obviously, no question around the foundry/logic side, given the complexity of larger buyer size. But curious, as you see increased memory into the mix, is there enough share of wallet on the logic/foundry side to kind of mitigate that and allow that relative outperformance? Would love to hear the kind of puts and takes around that. Yes, we feel pretty good, C.J. We're seeing relative performance this year, and this is a year that's still pretty heavy overall in what I'll call legacy levels of investment, particularly in China. So as we start to move to leading edge and you see the entry ramp and also the initial investments; and then too, we would expect that given our position, particularly in certain markets that we expect to scale and grow much faster than the overall that we're pretty well positioned into next year to see foundry and logic leading edge investment drive KLA share of the overall spend. We were talking about DRAM and HBM.
HBM is a device that tends to -- first of all, you have advanced DRAM, you have EUV as a -- you get the introduction of for use of those chips, but also as you start to put the chips together, it creates not only potential packaging opportunities moving forward, but you also have increased sampling to ensure that each of the DRAM die is functioning properly. So we've seen DRAM improve from a process control intensity point of view since the introduction of EUV. And so I would expect to see that continue as well as we move forward. So, yes I think we feel pretty good about the relative positioning of the company as we move into next year. So C.J. one of the things that we're seeing, and we haven't seen in many, many years, if you remember, part of the reason memory had lower adoption was because of repair. And it seems that on leading DRAM, repair is less effective than it's been. And so that is a factor that's driving some of our customers. Obviously, they're going to try to get through that. But that's -- they're expecting that they're going to have larger need for -- a greater need for process control because of that.
And as Brent said, you also have -- because of EUV, you get the introduction of print check into memory, and they have issues associated with pellicles. So I know it's very much into the weeds, but it drives more print check. So the process control adoption is setting it up to maybe be better than historical while most at least for the advanced DRAM. And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. As the team steps into the second half of this year, advanced technology node deployment is accelerating, obviously reflected in your strong guidance for the September quarter, appears to be reflected in your confidence on the spending outlook this calendar year and grows into next. Near term, does the team anticipate sequential growth in the December quarter? And then relative to let's say, last earnings call, has your qualitative view on 2025 improved? I mean, I know, Rick, you mentioned incrementally better 3-nanometer investments. Any other indicators that are coming in better versus your prior expectations, as you look into next year? Harlan, I'll start here. First, we do expect sequential growth in the December quarter, as we discussed last quarter when we talked about the March quarter being the bottom and expectation of sequential growth through the year. So that's how we see things into the December quarter. We'll see how things play out in terms of what that looks like. I would say on the margin, we're incrementally more bullish certainly when you look at the funnel in terms of opportunities into next year. As we've seen that fill out, we have seen strength in the funnel to support our outlook into next year. Perfect. And then for my follow-up, and this is sort of a follow-on to what Rick was saying, but as you mentioned, memory has always had a lower process control intensity. But there are dynamics that are pushing advanced logic-like capabilities, right, into memory. You mentioned more EUV layer adoption in DRAM, but like for example, in HBM DRAM, I mean, that's required is very advanced logic chip that is at the bottom of the staff, right? That's using against [indiscernible] logic technology in NAND, the periphery and controller chip, which is increasingly becoming more advanced logic is being processed separately from the NAND stack, right, and then bond it together. And then this whole NAND sort of bonding technology process appears to be a nightmare manufacturability and yield perspective. 
But kicking in totality, I mean, it does appear that these dynamics are driving memory process control intensity higher. I mean, any way to quantify, I know historically, memory intensity has been about 10%. But if you look at all of these trends over the next few years, like where can you see that memory intensity sort of trending to? Yes. It's a good question, Harlan. And you did cover all the advancements that have us pretty excited in terms of opportunity moving forward. We have seen intensity improve over the last couple of years or so. But what we're waiting for to lean in, if you will, into those -- to that improvement is to see a full cycle in terms of investment by our customers. And so I think as we look into next year, I think that where we are today is probably we're historically around 10% that were probably in excess of 11% today. And I think moving forward, if we can execute and deliver some of the products and capabilities we have in development here, I think it creates a number of opportunities covering the things that you talked about and some of the other things we talked about in the last question or 2. Yes. And just contrast that from a few years ago, Harlan, if you go back and you think about 3D, 3D happens and our customers go backwards in lithography, right? DRAM is not really pushing design rules nor pushing advanced logic around the DRAM and repair is still working. Like if you take all those factors off and you get more into the expected growth and intensity that you get in logic or in the leading-edge foundry for similar reasons. But so we haven't fully modeled it because it's really hard, customers are still trying to figure it out. 
But there's more characterization happening at the leading edge, leading us to believe that there is going to be more implementation. But until they've been through the cycles, they don't know, but it is to Bren's point, why we feel more bullish in our engagement in those customers, they recognize an increased need for the process control capability. And then you just add on this bonding packaging question, and that's a huge issue and the value of HBM is so high also. So I think there's a lot of factors. In many ways, there are plenty of opportunities. Then the other part of that, the answer is, making sure that our solutions actually are going to work for those opportunities, and we're still proving that out. We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur -- I apologize from Atif Malik with Citi. The first one for Rick on gate-all around-PDC intensity. Some of your peers have talked about 30% increase in metrology intensity at 2-nanometer gate-all-around or 3-nanometer. And the reticle inspection peers have talked about EUV map that's actually coming down to 20 from 30 to 3-nanometer. So when we put these 2 trends together, I'm curious how you're looking at your overall PVC intensity? And does that imply that you're gaining share on the reticle side? So let me unpack that a little bit. I think that it is definitely the case for gate-all-around that it creates new integration challenges and so we've seen, and we've talked about this for some time now, the adoption of Gen 4 to support that in a new configuration to be able to resolve the issues around that. So there is -- that's a driver. It's also a different approach than what customers have to use for the -- because we are [indiscernible]. There's more metrology intensity being used and largely an increase in the need to control voltage threshold. So VT control becomes more important. And so that's also a part of it. 
You also accept film thickness measurement and management hire. So overall, we would anticipate, but that's all kind of rolled into how we model the increasing process control intensity that we've outlined before there's really nothing that's different than when we modeled that going forward toward our 2026 plan in terms of overall process control intensity and our share performance there. Atif, if you look back to the last local high and KLA share WFE, it was when the industry transitioned from planar to FinFET structures. So typically, architecture changes do drive because of just the change that's happening and the immaturity of the change, it does drive process control intensity to a higher level. So historically, it's proven. So Rick talked about not only inspection opportunities, but you're depositing a lot more layers, 20% to 30% more critical layers on the metrology side. So we think in a number of areas, it's going to create opportunities. And you still have the scaling dynamics, while litho layers are constant. Those are still pretty challenging layers in terms of -- from a defect control point of view. So we're pretty bullish about the opportunities. I think it's feeding into a lot of what we've said here over -- in the last few questions in terms of our confidence moving into next year. Great. As a follow-up, Bren, the revenue guide is a bit wider than usual, plus minus $150 million versus $125 million. Is that just a function of higher revenues? Or is there something else? Yes, a function of higher revenues. It's about 5% or so. At some point, as we move through the different quarters and revenue ranges, we start to make an adjustment just because of the higher levels. So there's nothing indicative in that other than the revenue is up 9% higher and we decided to -- it was 9% in June and then the guidance, another 7%. So that it was prudent to raise the range. You have to also remember that we do have integers that are quite large. If you think about our broadband plasma systems, they could be anywhere even plus $20 million depending on the configuration. So tools moving in and out can have an impact in terms of our overall. So it's really more just the increasing revenue level and not related to anything else. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. I guess first question is on the trends that you're seeing in mature node. And specifically -- well, I guess, China revenue in general, I think your prior comments were an expectation for China about flat in the second half. You talked about if that's still your view and what you're seeing outside of the leading edge? Yes. It still might not be the absolute dollar basis right? And then with the second half growing relative to the first half, the percent will start to move in the second half versus the first half. But on an absolute dollar basis, as I said last quarter, it's about flat. Now depending on what happens, you've got a lot of new projects and rev requal could be an issue with newer customers. So where it shows up in terms of which quarter, I'm not going to comment on. But if you just take a take a step back and look at a half-to-half point of view, it's very similar to what I said last quarter. Got it. And then following on, you made some comments about the impact of high NA in the past. I mean, one, could you remind us a little bit about the impact of high NA on process control? And then secondly, with regard to timing for that, there's been some noise around that about sort of implementation schedules? Anything different than you see on your side? And I recognize that you folks would probably be a little bit earlier in seeing that given the timing of when you install process control? Well, I think that the difference for high NA -- the most obvious difference is you're going to continue scaling. So you're going to get smaller defects and you're going to have new challenges associated with reticle qualification and that takes the form both in the mass shop and requal and [indiscernible]. So all those factors continue, but it's really an extension of the trends that we've seen. And when you get high NA, you'll get also just the mix will shift. You'll have some layers initially of high NA and then you'll have others that are going to be the 0.33. 
I think what we're hearing and seeing from customers is very consistent with what we believed in terms of when HVM happens. We don't see any acceleration in the timing. If anything, there's the potential for delay in terms of the HVM implementation, there will be characterization work happening before that. 
But like all technology transitions, we see -- the existing technology often extends longer and has more upgrades and it's more cost effective. And that's what drives customers ultimately, it's about the economics. And so I think what will happen is if they can do that, then they'll bias toward extending the life of the 0.33 and the efficacy of that in the leading edge and then high NA comes after. So nothing has really changed in our view. No acceleration, if anything, potential for some additional delay in the implementation. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. First one is actually on China and Rick and Bren thanks to the insight on the China revenues. I just kind of wanted to ask a question in a different way. One of your peers [indiscernible] International today said that China mature nodes are in a digesting mode and calendar Q1 was the peak. I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that? And how to think about China sales into next year, especially given a long lead time you might have a better insight than others? And also, is that a factor in your gross margin down just a smidge and a shift in September quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Yes, Krish. On China, it looks -- like I said earlier, I think from a half-to-half point of view, it's relatively flat. So I don't see any real change. A lot of that's dependent on project timing given the level of greenfield activity that we're seeing there. As we move into next year, my early view on our business levels is more or less consistent with what we're seeing this year.
I think when you look at the order funnel, what we have in backlog, what we have in deposits, gives me some confidence in terms of what we see into next year. So I don't see a change. Obviously, the mix could -- will be changing. There's infrastructure investments. It's obviously the logic/foundry memory and so on. But from an overall level, it seems that it's pretty consistent year-to-year.
On gross margin, it -- while we outperformed in the June quarter, it was a little bit more than what we had initially modeled in the quarter. There's some adjustment that we're seeing in the September quarter. from that. When you look at KLA gross margins, I talk a lot about product mix being the biggest driver of our gross margin in terms of variability quarter-to-quarter. It's not customer mix, it's not region mix. It is the portfolio mix and not all the products in our portfolio carry the same margin profile, but also within the product families themselves. And particularly when you're selling across multiple nodes with highly configurable systems, you can end up with bearing gross margin profile even within the same product families. So it's really a function of that than it is anything else. 
And of course, the June quarter was stronger. I did put the comments, which were very consistent with last quarter in terms of expectations for this year in the mid 61% range. That's our expectation. And then moving forward, as we see the business continue to grow at '25, I think you'll see KLA's general incremental gross margin performance in and around that 65% incremental gross margin, plus or minus, as we move forward here. But in any given quarter, it could have a little bit of variability, but nothing that's different than what we usually see. Got it. Very helpful, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. Thanks for the color, like the $500 million run rate from $400 million like 3 months ago. Is this really a function of the advanced packaging market growing? Or are you like targeting newer markets like macro inspection, which I feel like your peers or your competitors are doing better than that? Are you like targeting those markets that's also helping some of this incremental revenue growth into this year? And also kind of curious if you can extrapolate that into like panel level packaging, which is probably a few years out? Yes. I think there's no question that the package market is growing, and it's for all the reasons that you hear, I think that there's been an acceleration. And again, I mentioned earlier in the call that some of the gaps, if you think about what's going on overall with AI or packaging shortage related. So there's a lot of investment happening there. Is it not -- it's not just macro, it's what historically would have been considered pretty advanced lithography not that -- or especially not that many years ago because the design rules and the yield and the what's at risk, cost-wise is much higher. 
Many years ago, when we bought a company and started doing packaging, one of our customers asked, why are you even bothering, this is not a KLA market. What happened in the last year is now customers are saying, we need your capability that you have in the front end to be applied into some of our advanced packaging challenges and accelerated workshops with us talking about that accelerated product road maps and a lot of customer excitement and interest. So they're driving it very hard because they have shortages, and it's really across many of our products, both in our processing, but also in our process control. So it's been significant to see the growth and the speed of it. As we said, that's the annualized -- that's the annual number for calendar '24, but we'd expect the trend to continue towards growth in '25 and beyond. Most of our growth has been more on the logic side. And I think one of the things we're excited about moving forward is that as you move in high-bandwidth memory to hybrid bonding techniques, they do increase the complexity of the process a fair amount. And as you know, the KLA position in the market is one of higher value offerings, supporting more complexity. And so we're encouraged by what those opportunities might look like as we get out into the '26 and '27 time frame.
Obviously, the industry is thinking a lot about what's next in terms of panel level packaging and so on. And so there's obviously R&D that goes into that. But -- so that's work that we will be doing in the company. And so I think that those opportunities, to Rick's point, are just showcasing, I think what's the opportunities that are available in this part of the market over the next several years. Just one final point. Some of our customers -- our competitors are coming at this from a lower end. And in many cases, the requirements are at the top end of their capability. And so what we're hearing from customers is, even though, in some cases, they're buying our systems, where at the bottom end of our capability, what they also want is the road map. So I think they want the ability to buy that capability now with the expectation and the knowledge that they can upgrade it over time as their requirements continue because you are now with that packaging. There's no question that road map is going to look more like a traditional scaling road map going forward. We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. I just want to kind of understand, I think looking at the guide for the September quarter and thinking about sequential growth into the December quarter, is it more fair to assume now they're kind of thinking about low double-digit half-on-half growth rate for the calendar year relative to the high single digit last quarter that you talked about and then kind of duck tailing that, I think last quarter, you talked about process control systems mixes being closer to like 70% for foundry/logic. Is that maybe a bit higher than that now? Yes. So on those fronts, so again, I don't want to guide December, but I think high single digit, low double digit is probably the right way to think about our performance for the year overall. So I think that as we saw in June relative to the expectations we had a few months ago, we did better than we thought September guide was higher, certainly higher than what consensus was. So I think the incremental optimism I talked about earlier in the funnel is revealing and some incremental growth here through the second half of the year. When I look at the overall mix of business, I think that foundry logic is likely closer to 75%. So last year it was 70-30 or approximate semiconductor process control shipments -- or revenue to semiconductor customers is closer to 75, 25 and 24. But we'll see how it ends up. Perfect. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, the strength you're talking about, I mean, given the lead times for Gen 4, Gen 5, I mean is that going to kind of enter the model in terms of demand into next year? Is that how we should think about that? Or can some of those tools be pulled into 2024? Well, we are seeing more capacity come online. Those are products where we've been supply constrained certainly around Gen 4. So as new capacity comes online. I think it's one of the challenges for us, frankly, back in 2023 as we were limited and as we move through this year, from a quarterly run rate point of view, we are getting incremental supply and that -- given the supply constraints and the level of demand, we are seeing growth there and would expect to see that continue into next year. 
So I'm fairly bullish on that part of the business growing faster than the overall market, both this year and next year. So I think that's one of those areas that I said earlier about our relative confidence in terms of share of the overall market is our presence in certain markets that are growing extremely fast relative to the overall and certainly high-end wafer inspection is one of those. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. I wanted to double quick on China and what you're seeing in the region. You guys gave a lot of color in terms of what you're expecting for the overall geo. But by application, any standouts as you think about DRAM, foundry, other applications or maybe by customer type, mask making, wafer making, et cetera, whether it be trends you saw in the first half? Or as you think about the flattish outlook in the second half, and you stand out to the positive side or the negative side? DRAM was stronger in the first half and will be in the second half. I would expect that wafers probably a little weaker. I think on the reticle side, it's a little bit stronger. And then foundry logic is stronger offsetting the weaker memory. Some weakness in automotive. Got it. And then as a follow-up on your services business, you guys grew 14% year-over-year. and you're outperforming your peers, and I think that's off of a higher base relative to your peers, too. really good to see that. You talked about growing toward the high end for the remainder of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Is that just simply utilization rates across your customer base improving? Or is there more to it? And as a quick follow-up, is 12% to 14% still the right range? Yes. So utilization rates are certainly a factor. So we've seen those steadily improve across all segments in the course of this year. And so that's been a driver of incremental revenue. The other thing, and we had pretty good visibility to this was the shipments that we -- or the tools that we shipped in '21 and '22 have come off of warranty and gone into contract. In our contract renewal or attach rate is about 95%. So as those tools go up a warranty into contract that that's a driver. So we've had pretty good visibility into the service business.
We've had a headwind from FX because you do have some of the service revenue denominated in local currency, particularly in Japan. So there's been some headwinds to the growth rate, frankly. But yes, we're trending towards that 14% sort of top part of the guidance range. And I think for the target we put out there. And I think as we go over the next couple of years, I feel like we're closer to the top end of the range than the bottom end of the range. We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. I also had a couple of China follow-ups. At one point, you had a pretty sizable multinational business in China is the business today mostly dominated by the China sovereigns, I assume? Yes. We're a very little multinational business in China. Okay. And then on the China sovereign side, I mean, having seen that business shift to more of a trailing edge focus, what's happened to process control intensity? And you seem to be keeping pace with all of your competitors in terms of China exposure. So you seem to be doing quite well. I might have thought that the process control intensity would drop off given the focus on lagging edge technology. Sure. It's definitely not as high as what you would see on leading edge. But often in the case of you have small relatively size-wise small sites, then you're not really up against the percent against a huge number of wafer starts. So that's one factor. The other factor is some of the infrastructure that people are adding in terms of whether it's mask shops or wafer. So in aggregate, that's why it's, for us, it's pretty much helps serve. And Joe, on the multinational question, I mean, most of that business is service, right? We're not really -- there's no real equipment business that's happening with our multinational customers there, but there is sort of this activity supporting those fabs. And then we'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri. Couple of long -- actually, one question about 2025 WFE. Rick, obviously, demand is improving across the board, in China is stable. So that makes sense that WFE will grow next year. I'm just wondering in terms of -- in your assumptions, what sort of assumptions are you making as far as the chips money is concerned? Because the check seems to be coming in, in second half. Just wondering if we're getting an explicit signals from your customers that, that money is being spent in 2025? Yes. Our forecasts are entirely independent of any CHIP act money. There's no dependence on that. That if our customers receive that, it's going to be -- they're going to be getting it what they tell us is to offset cost of building fabs in places that are more expensive. But it's not contributing to that they're going to build capacity based on demand. The demand is just going to be based on their market, the overall market and then they'll buy equipment accordingly. But we're not counting on our customers back CHIP act money to make our plans. And then more of a technology question, Rick. I time to time, get questions about PMI for mask inspection. My understanding is that you guys were involved in that market and maybe exited at some point? I'm just curious, maybe I'm wrong here, but I just want to get your thoughts on that as to how you're approaching that market and what your strategy for that market is? Yes. We have not -- we're heavily involved in the [indiscernible] market. It's a market that really we started the company with, and we're still involved in it heavily. The question on, do you need actinic inspection for reticles. It's been a long debate that we've had in our conclusion based on all the analysis that we've seen is the real market need for that is when high NA gets introduced because of the existing technology nodes, there's really 3 ways to deal with the problems. 
One is the challenges of the reticle quality. One is the flagship product line that we've had for a long time, the 6xx accident extensions to that. The other one is an e-beam product that we've talked about that's being used for very high resolution. And right now, it's the highest sensitivity reticle inspection tool still in where -- with our customers, we're still in the characterization of that tool, that's the 8xx. And then the last one is printing onto wafers and verifying the goodness of the reticles and that's what we're using basically using the Gen 5 print check application for. 
When it comes to investment in the actinic or the product that we've identified for high NA, we're pretty confident of our ability to intercept the high [indiscernible] volume manufacturing of high NA, which is still some years away. And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel. Just want to ask a few questions. Rick, it's not about inflections and sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Are you also seeing this in terms of bookings? And did your 12-month shippable RPO increase this quarter? So we'll have all the specifics on that in the 10-K that we'll file here another week or 2. It was pretty close to flat, down about $70 million quarter on quarter, so pretty flattish compared to last quarter. I think given what we're seeing in the funnel, I would expect it likely to probably over the next few quarters, we'll start to see it increase. But yes, just slightly down from last quarter. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess you've made a lot of disclosures in the past couple of calls about advanced packaging, and you saw even a step-up on the year forecast over the past 3 months. Can you sort of ballpark how large the advanced packaging process control TAM is? It's -- you're probably not at your kind of typical on average 50%, 60% market share in process control overall. But maybe a sense of what the starting point is now. And obviously, I'm sure you expect the market to grow and probably your share as well in the years ahead. I'll let Bren deal with the specifics. This is Rick. But it's not just process control for us. It's also process tools because of the SPTS acquisition we did about 5 years ago. Yes. Look, we -- right now, our view is that this part of the market will grow faster than overall WFE. So if you look in the long run, as we expect WFE over the next few years, the capital intensity slowly rising to grow a little bit faster than semiconductor revenue that this part of the market will likely grow faster than that. So that's the only quantifying we've done at this point. To Rick's point, we have a broad portfolio we're seeing parts of it on the inspection side move up market, but we also sell a number of process tools. We also sell some chemical process control capability as well. So we're approaching this market in multiple ways. And like I said, I think that, as we talked about earlier, in the memory part of the market as it relates to HBM, we think we're better positioned relative to some of the technology transitions that are coming in terms of our share opportunity moving forward. We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. I want to ask you on the outlook for EPC. I think you were looking for growth last time. Might have came in a little bit below. Just curious since we're going through all the calendar '24 forecast, if you could update that one. Yes. On specialty semiconductor quarter-to-quarter, it dipped a little bit in the June quarter, but that's more of a timing issue. I think our expectation in that business is still some modest growth for the year. That has -- that business has a pretty diversified market exposure. And as power semi related to automotive has come down. We've seen packaging pick up, but there's a little bit of a dip in June, but recovers and has a much stronger second half.
Flat panel business is where we announced our exit of that, and so we still have revenue in our plans for that as we exit that business and would expect in the manufacturing likely in Q1 of 2025. On the PCB front, which is more consumer centric, we still have -- that market has been relatively sluggish, it's improved a bit, but not much. And that's obviously tied much more to mobility. And so improvements into the future as we see more cell phone unit growth will drive that business. 
Now there was -- that business had a very strong '21 and into '22, a lot of capacity added during that COVID period. And so the industry is still working off some of that capacity. Now in that business, we do have service exposure. So you have pretty good contract penetration in the PCB world. So while the systems business has been slower, there have been service contributions from a revenue point of view that we've had over the last year or so. But I would think that overall the aggregate part of that business is up a few points year-to-year. I think it's -- we'll call low to mid-single digits. And then I just wanted to ask -- I know there's been a couple of questions on China. I hear from others that you're hearing less new names, and I think the thought was maybe it would be more build-out of facilities that were already in process. You talked about greenfield there. And obviously, there's another slug of money potentially coming in. So as you look out a year more. I'm just kind of curious how you think about that frenzy we had before of all these new names that you never heard of before, creating companies. Are you seeing any view that, that might come back? Well, there's still some new business from new customers. The other thing that's happening in China is you do see investment from our mature legacy customers in China. And so where we've been engaged in supporting those customers for many, many years. And their businesses are typically driven by supply for specific markets and in response to expectations of demand moving forward. So you do have those customers also investing more here, I think, moving forward. 
And then you do move into second phases with certain ones, but there's also some new ones too. So it's a pretty broad mix as I look at the remainder of this year and into next year. And we'll take our last question today from Tim Arcuri with UBS. I had 2. So Bren, my question on China. So there's been some recent news. Obviously, the U.S. diplomatic commerce is trying to use the foreign [indiscernible] against some of the non-U.S. suppliers and it would kind of suggest that maybe there's some forthcoming news that there's a reason why they would want to use the FDPR, like maybe some [indiscernible]. So how do you think about that? I know it's kind of hard for you to even handicap your guidance for that? And I assume you're not accounted for that at all because you don't even know like when that's going to come. But how do you kind of think about that and what the likelihood is and how do you even [indiscernible] for it? Yes, Tim, I mean, there's been a lot of news for some time. And so you're right, I can't participate here in speculation and hypotheticals about what could or could not happen. So we will continue to assess very closely with the U.S. government. Of course, we do everything we need to do in the company to be in compliance. We'll follow the laws we do, and we'll support our customers as well within the confines of whatever the regulations are. So if and when something happens, we'll assess the impact and let you know what the impact is in sort of the near term and what might be over the long term. Well, one of the things we talked about a lot, Tim, and I know you know this, is the because of where we are with the AI drivers, we're seeing an acceleration at the leading edge. So if we think about what's really going to propel our business going forward, it's not so much the legacy, which has been may be overrepresented on historical levels the last few years. But it's the stuff we're seeing right now, especially at the leading edge in terms of leading-edge foundry, and that's been driving a lot of our business in our expectations around what we're seeing in N3 and N2, plus the packaging plus we're seeing in HBM. So if I think about '25, '26, those are going to be the things that drive KLA drive our performance and should drive good opportunities for our investors. If you go back to 2022, 75% plus of our business was what we'll call leading edge advanced design rules, 20-nanometer or below. So with the expectation of a ramp into next year from our leading-edge customers on the logic and memory side, we think that, that's going to drive the hundreds of our business as we move over the course of next year and beyond. Okay. And then last thing. So book-to-bill based on the RPO, book-to-bill was just a touch below 1%. So this is the seventh quarter that it's been below 1. And it sounds like you think book-to-bill is going to start to drift up actually that we're going to finally start to be above 1. So is there some dynamic where it seems like there was this massive slug of bookings that happened back in mid-'22 and we've been kind of shipping off of that ever since. And are we kind of getting to a point now where you think that customers are kind of coming back in and there and we could begin to see book-to-bill start to drift above 1, where we can start to not just be shipping off of this big slug of orders in the middle of 2022? Yes. I think based on the funnel that we will see -- I think the order profile looks pretty good. Now orders are not always indicative of what's going on given the number of customers and the size of the orders. And then when it comes to KLA, even the size of the ASPs of certain types of products. But all that being said, yes, it went from about $13 billion at its peak in terms of RPO down to just up 10 today. So it's still quite large, but I would expect that moving forward that at least over the next couple of quarters, it looks that the order profile looks decent. So yes, I think that's a reasonable way to see it. I'll now turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. All right. On behalf of KLA, we appreciate your time and your interest. We'll be seeing many of you through this quarter at conferences.
